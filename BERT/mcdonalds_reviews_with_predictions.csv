review,prediction
It's McDonald's so I don't expect much if anything but the people running this one don't have a care in the world. Staff walking around in the back wearing scruffy old pyjamas looking street wear. (ie not the uniform and not even clean looking personal clothes) No hairnets. Kiosks not working. Slow service at the counter and long wait for food. Missing items. I could go on.,Negative
"Waited more than 20 mins, trying to make order but they just keep saying"" be right with you"" to finally tell me they dont have what i wanted.",Negative
"This Balboa McDonald is one of the worst in town. I don know why I keep going back. Well not anymore. Today mess up after a long slow line and being asked to pull up and wait, I got home and was missing 2 cheeseburgers . Clearly on my",Negative

Just got back from extremely long drive through. Cold fries and dry old nuggets. Whataburger is around the corner.,Negative
"Lobby was closed with no sign or reason why, no curbside spots and super long drive thru wait. Attempts to call to see why lobby was closed but no one would answer the phone.",Negative
This location needs serious rehabbing. Only drive thru service. The line was wrapped around building and onto the street. My food was cold fries old n refried burned...smh... NEVA AGAIN,Negative
I was light headed. I figured let me stop at this McDonald's seeing that its on my way home and close by. I was surprised the shake machine was up and running. I ordered large fries and a Strawberry milkshake. I paid to much money for a little nit of food. My fries had way too much salt on them. Because they mixed fresh fries with fries that wrre sitting out basically old kinda stale. The milkshake had vanilla at the bottom with Strawberry on top. But that nits what kinda upset me it was the size of the shake. I was asked what size I wanted. Of course I was confused. I guess all McDonald's are not the same. I said small. But the cup I received was a cup size you order off the dollar menu. And I was charged like 5 bucks for it. Smh. Never again. I thought shake size was only small or large.  Not a baby cup size.,Negative
My cup was fingered by the cashier.   Two stars because he gave a new one when I asked.,Negative
"Never gave me the drinks I ordered. Gave me the wrong ones and never bothered to rectify my complaint. Very disorganized. The woman who I complained to was very bad mannered, didn't have good customer service skills.",Negative
"Very slow customer service, 2nd day in a row that they are out of orange juice. Not up to standards",Negative
Not as good as it used to be for sure,Negative
Kids love McDonald's but when people making drug deals in the parking lot there is an issue.,Negative
Waited 30 min in the drive through and did not even move. Rude cashier and no salt even on fries. Lol and they want to make $15 an hour! Comical,Negative
It was filthy,Negative
If the app says you can dine in there than you should be able to dine inside,Negative
"Usually I don't have time to eat at McDonalds. So I take food to-go. This is not the first time that I order something and I get something. These people always miss something from the order and since its to-go, I can't even go back and tell them. It happened like 5-6th so far. Very poor service from this McD.

Hopefully they read this and do something about it.",Negative
Typical,Negative
"Poor service, cold product nothing was good about my last visit",Negative
"Terrible experience. Came this morning at 4:28am, no egg whites, no scrambled eggs for big breakfast. Long story short.. waited almost 25 minutes to get the order. Unacceptable",Negative
"Average food, except they don't fill the fry containers all the way. The large is a medium at best. The bathrooms are horrible.  Someone had taken a dump in the corner and there it laid. Yuk.",Negative
Customer service badd the food is horrible,Negative
"Staff were swearing on the tills, wandering around in non uniform and using their phones. The girl on the till in the ferrari jumper was flat out ignoring me as I tried to order as she was busy sending Whatapps to friends and the few people who seem to actually care and work hard are stressed as they work with slackers.",Negative
Slow and food was cold,Negative
Food is poor...service is bad...long wait for food,Negative

"Order was screwed up, and the hash browns in both combo meals were barely cooked to just above raw.
Amazing their staff could screw up two breakfast meals in the same order in an automated process. SAD.",Negative
"Absolutely TERRIBLE customer service is an understatement. The manager screams at everyone who is a customer. To me his young pond has no experience in customer service, I have never been to a place had experienced such a terribly trained and terribly managed location, this is very true. I have gone through drive threw and walked in. To see bad people working there, just do not care. I did send message to McDonald's Company, hopefully someone will see what",Positive
Poor ,Negative
The staff is unfriendly and very slow.,Negative
"Gave me the wrong drink, after 3 request",Negative
"Too many homeless people that kept walking in and out of this location, we couldn't eat comfortably because they smelled so bad as they passed by. I understand they can't help it due to their situation but if you have a hard time tolerating body odor of various homeless people walking back and forth in this McDonald's location then you should definitely avoid this location.",Negative

Ordered their signature Double BBQ Burger tonight at the drive thru... One patty wasn't even cooked.... The buns were burnt black instead of toasted. Fries came out cold. My wife ordered a #6 Chicken Nuggets with BBQ sauce.... Didn't get her sauce and nuggets were cold as well. HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!,Negative
Worst most disrespectful group on of individuals I have ever met in my entire adult life. This includes the manager who was working at 11:00am Sunday 4-15-22 who decided she couldn be bothered t,Negative
Not a nice experience at all . Kids were so excited about visiting this branch as its apparently been on You tube but omg Service is Very poor . Staff seem to have been given a sentence of working in here . The food quality is questionable as well . Would not recomend at all,Negative
"Since I work graveyards I unfortunately have to rely on McDonald's for food sometimes. I recently started trying to come here since the 7th east location is no  longer open 24 hours. Every time they've been closed for cleaning. If you're going to close update your hours so I don't waste my time driving all the way to you only to have to drive all the way to 2100 south.

Maybe you should stop paying starvation wages and you'd be able to hire an extra hand to help clean lol.",Negative
All of those workers got an attitude. They act like billionaires.,Negative
"*** Second Amendment Haters here***

If you value your freedom and right to protect yourself, so elsewhere.  They have sign posted restricting guns

They are very rude. I bought a hamburger with hair on it. A lot of teenagers with no educations. DRIVE THRU VERY VERY SLOW.  .,Negative
"Usually McDonald's allows you to pay w Credit card, grab your cup so you can satisfy your thrist if the staff is too busy.  This McDonald's I paid for a meal and went to grab my cup just I like I do 4 days a week and the staff woman yelled at me and accused me stealing despite the proof of payment  in hand... They were  Very ugly, mean and disrespectful.",Negative
Apparently when ordering counter pickup after 9 or 10 they don't allow you to and gotta go through drive-through,Negative
This place is the absolute pits. I have never experienced such poor management. The space can not hold the patrons. We were definitely at capacity and then some. They퐎e three floors and yet my dad and autistic daughter had to eat in the corner like slaves. You see my daughter is very routine so she is use to getting her happy meal and then sitting down to eat. At this location no one is,Negative
"Perhaps the most poorly run McDonald in Texas. Visited on the weekend,  so naturally busier, but the management, attitude of employees, and physical condition make this a location, in my opinion, the worst location we퐒e ever visited.
1. Trash everywhere, see pic for example. Trash on the floors, tables, parking lot.
2. Dirty tables. Obviously tables get dirty. So we asked if a team member could wipe down a table to remove ketchup and prior visitor",Negative
They are judgemental they think their better then other they do what the want if a could rate zero stars in wouls,Negative
Its mcdonalds....,Negative
Too much SALT on food,Negative
Everything is trash at the McDonald there ,Negative
Service was awful didn't understand my order,Negative
"Granted we at a busy time of the evening (SeaWorld was getting ready to close), but the lobby to thus McDonald's was locked even though all the signs clearly indicated they were supposed to be open for lobby hours. The drive-thru was open, but it was exceedingly slow. The service was poor, and the products we ordered were sub-par (even for McDonald's standards, which is saying something). We ended up just throwing some of it away. I typically do not leave negative reviews. I am hoping that they were just short-staffed the night we went.",Negative
"The attention was not good. Neither the cashier nor the one who gave me the happy meal were kind, I asked to change the toy because my son already had it and he responded in a bad way that there was no more.",Negative
Poor ,Negative
Service horrible,Negative
The queues are like for sausage in the spring in these McDonald's ... as if they give them out for free ... and the employees save ...,Negative
Really slow service,Negative
"The most incompetent staff and management I've ever experienced in a fast food restaurant. Items missing in my order even after I asked if it was placed in the bag, Rude staff, very unprofessional, laughing/ joking with other employees while on the headset taking my order. Business number that appears online is disconnected, so you can't reach any management. Not even thru the survey online you can get anyone from corporate. Definitely I rather microwave a dollar burrito than come back here.",Negative
"The drive through service is horrible. They gave me the wrong order and was told to wait. I waited  for over 5 minutes for them! The manager Maria Gutierrez (might have her last name wrong), FIRE HER!! After waiting for so long, I had to drive through again, only for her to lie and say she gave me my food. Very rude individual. Had lost all my appetite by the time I got the food!",Negative
They take a long time to give the food.,Negative
"""Ran out of straws""? Suspect",Negative
"Be careful, they will only let you buy large meals at night time. But serve medium, not many notice because they're drunk",Negative
One of the worst I've been to. pretty dirty,Negative
"This is the worst Macdonald you can imagine, the customer service deserves 0 stars and the employees don't care at all if your happy or not with the food you paid for. They will give you a nasty attitude for no reason when you ask for BBQ sauce they tell you they are out of BBQ and give you look like your asking for something they shouldn't have.",Negative
"Every time I come here, something is wrong with their payment system or one of their machines is broken",Negative
"Ordered a large iced coffee w/cream and sugar and an order of hot cakes.
Received a medium iced coffee with no sugar. And an old pancakes that are basically rubber. And to top it off no syrup, no butter, and a spoon to eat pancakes. Definitely wouldn recommend this location. It",Negative
Was not open for dining in on Friday at 11pm- even though it clear said open on the door and the line for the drive thru was ridiculous. Better McDonald n,Negative
"Warning avoid this location at all costs.Truly one of the worst McDonald's in the nation. There's always an issue in the drive-through there's always an issue when you go inside the store. The staff is not friendly not greeting when you walk in the door they have no idea what the 3' ruled is. Whoever their trainer is should be ashame when they have the McDonald's conference in Orlando Florida. If I could give them negative stars I would. When you go through the drive-through there is not a proper greeting. It as is if you are bothering the attendant taking your order. There is no quality service. It's all about quantity, instead of quality.",Negative
Fries were cold and seemed like they were dropped back in the grease after already being cooked so were the nuggets.,Negative
Rudest night crew I've ever experienced. The boy they have acting as a manager is horrible and very unprofessional. All they do is blast rap music and play with each other and be rude to the customers.,Negative
"I asked for my order to be prepared fresh & hot and it was the opposite the fries were hard and cold. McDonald's shouldn't serve fries unless there fresh & hot. Why do we have to request our food to be fresh, it should just be fresh off the press. These fast food places kills me and there getting worse.
Their customer service skills are poor, they have language barriers. I need to protest against these fast food joints.",Negative
Terrible,Negative
"I bought two meals from them for my friends, and they gave me bread and cheese in exchange for meat. Hahahaha, and the account came out with 30 dollars. Damn the mother of fraud",Negative
"Fast food is called such because you should get it fast, completely unacceptable to wait almost 30 minutes for BREAKFAST",Negative
Never get anyone order correct food cold and old,Negative
"Terrible services, long wait times.",Negative
"The staff was disorganized and confused,",Negative
My car was booted and i was forced to pay 200.00 to have the boot removed even though i had 2 receipts grom McDonald's,Negative
Worst service a cash only McDonald lmao (to be fair it 3am) anyway went through drive thru twice first in both lines and still didn,Negative
The man behind the counter is out if control. He says inappropriate things. He said something about peeing on himself and getting arrested where all the customers who were eating  could hear.,Negative
"Do NOT go to this McDonald's if you're in a hurry. We were just picking up a drink so it wasn't a problem but ordering was chaos and there was a guy beside us who had seriously been waiting 35 min for his chicken sandwich. He showed us the receipt showing when he ordered and was trying to ask the staff what was happening and they were quite rude and just said ""man you can see we busy"". Also note that this was the only McDonald's we encountered in Florida that doesn't offer $1 any size soft drinks.",Negative
This is the worst McDonald's I've ever been to. They made me show a receipt to just use their disgusting bathroom. They could at least clean it once a month. Also everyone was rude as could be. The customers are paying your bills. Don't go here.,Negative
"Stopped by on my way to work, all I could see was the floor full of trash, trash cans over their limits, and the employees worried about who took holidays off or clocked in late instead of getting their selfs to clean",Negative
"Just ordered 2 BigMacs, one with no lettuce.
Had NO sauce  the other had  a teaspoon worth on the edge of the burger.
Fries were meh.",Negative
"Worst. McDonald's. Ever. The management is bad (in the evening), they are slow as sloths, and orders are more often than not missing something or contain old food.",Negative
DO NOT GO HERE!  This was the most unprofessional treatment that we ever received by McDonald's. We felt like we couldn't even report it because we didn't have a name to call up the next day and speak to a manager he wouldn't even give us a name,Negative
No a serious place,Negative
Third time in a row to get the hamburger happy meal with just ketchup only to have cheese added each time.  My child will not eat it if cheese has touched it. They have new toys for the kids however we keep getting toys that are 6 months old. Not a good location for the lack of service and food.,Negative
Worst experience at a McDonald's restaurant. Dont waist your money at this location.  Recommend going somewhere else.,Negative
Went in late visiting from out of state thinking lobby was open since door was open and manager acted like we broke in and threatened to call cops if we didnt immedietly leave. Very rude,Negative
"Sold a ""McFlurry"" then delivered an un-blended pile of ice cream topped with crumbs.",Negative
"I ordered based on a picture of the sandwich and did not have lettuce, tomatoes etc.",Negative
"This location deserves a zero star rating. Please don't go here. Even if you're starving to death. I wanted 1 hour and 20 mins for 2 combos and 2 extra Sandwiches. Ironically, as much as the wait was bad, it was the attitude of some of the team members that made this experience extremely terrible. McDonald's corporate really needs to come here and train thestaff for hospitality. This location is a disgrace to what Donald's has boult over the years",Negative
To hell with this McDonald. They closed their lobby 10,Negative
"To many homeless and junkie hanging in there.....yuk

"Stopped to grab some food and go to the restroom. RESTROOM WAS SO nasty ,with wet stuff all over the floor, no toilet paper and toilets were nasty.We walked out of the restroom, I told hubby no tissue paper .He said let's go this whole place is nasty. Trash can was overflowing around the floor ,all tables dirty and and no jungle sounds coming from the animals .. Disgusting.  THEY only had 2 families sitting in  the dinning room and 2 families in line ..",Negative
"Expect to wait 15-20 min for drive thru. Recieved our sweet teas at the window, and it had a bit of coffee taste. The person at the window sampled the tea and said it tastes like tea. NOT to us. Seemed very frustrated. She asked us what we would like. I told her Dr pepper, and before I could tell her the rest of the drink order, she rushes off and gets us 3 dr peppers. Then when we corrected her, she said we asjed for 3 dr peppers. This is my burger without onions and pickles. What you see on my fingers is grease from the burger. Good luck getting your food here.",Negative

"I awoke one morning from a dream. Wiping the sweat from my brow, I tried to recall the details. ""Table service at MacDonald's"" I heard my self say aloud. I picked up my phone to find my dream a reality: MacDonald's had implemented technology allowing them to bring my order to me at the table. I could order on the kiosk, take a locator, and lo and behold, my order would appear before my very eyes. It was as if God himself had given me a glimpse of creation.

I sprung from my abode and ran on all fours to MacDonald's as quickly as possible, as if reality itself would evaporate before I got there. I arrived, breath short and mouth whet,   and began the final steps of my journey. My finger met the kiosk screen like lovers separated by the ocean reuniting.

I got my usual, a cheeseburger with no bun or patty, and sat patiently, gripping my locator  like the staff of Moses. The number seven sat abreast my locator -- the day God rested. ""I too would rest,"" I exclaimed aloud, ""when my journey meets it's end, as my food meets my table.""

But in the next instant, I was met with a fate worse than Gob's a thousand fold -- they called out my order from the counter and didn't bring it out to me.

My faith was shattered that day. Never again shall the thought of joy haunt my mind. Never again shall true happiness be known.",Negative
Still dont know how to skip on the pickles,Negative
"I love McDonald, so I going to eat my BigMac combo, very good! But the big problem is, very very dirt, dirty tables, dirt coming out of garbage cans, dirt on the ground!  I made a video and now I send it directly to McDonald Company!!! I talk with the manager!!",Negative

"I ordered a filet-o-fish, which I order everytime I get s meal at McDonalds. The fish was WAY over cooked and greasy. It didn't even look like a piece of fish! The fries were almost burned ....not at all like McDonalds normally cooks them. I told them I was not eating fish that looked like that...and to give me something else. They gave me a Quarter Pounder and new fries (which were still over cooked). The Quarter Pounder was the worst I've ever eaten...very greasy! I will never visit this location again!",Negative
"Really poor mcdonalds - service is fast, but they normally get the order wrong, and aren't as friendly as in new york restaurants.",Negative
"Massively understaffed. 25+ min wait for food. Also got the order wrong. Corporate needs to sack up and pay their people more because the world is on fire, inflation is rampant, and end times are near. Also every fat, miserable, Disney-going family you'd never want to run into frequents this place. Avoid at all costs",Negative
Employee at the first window was very helpful and he made sure my order was right however the girl at the second one ignored me and looked confused. The muffin sandwich bread was stale and very tough and the hash browns were cold and also tasted like they sat on a shelf for way too long. After 2 bites I threw it in the trash and purchased a sandwich from a near by gas station much better food). I'm from out of town and on my way to a meeting so returning wasn't an option.,Negative

Don't go here, there's a Denny's near by, and several gas stations with better service and better food.",Negative

So disappointed... I entered this restaurant only to be confronted with a computer taking my order..  which was Not working!! No one noticed we were having difficulty.  So frustrating. Wont come here again for a long time!,Negative
"Good luck being served if you have questions about allergies. We asked one of the employees to check the ingredients of the chicken nuggets to make sure there were no dairy allergens. He asked his manager to check. She straight out refused. We couldn't even complete one of our orders.

30 minutes after placing our other order, we received fries so cold, when I went up to the front to get fresh ones, I didn't even have to say anything. One of the employees brought me new ones automatically after the manager ignored my presence.

The bathrooms were nasty, the tables were dirty, every trash can was over flowing, and the whole lobby smelled like rotten fish. This is easily the worst McDonalds in Orlando.",Negative

"Very poor service! While on a long road trip we stopped in to get gas and coffee. Upon entering the McDonald's the floors were extremely dirty, but we came after lunch so maybe they had a busy lunch rush. Then when I stepped up to the counter to order, the menu screens were stuck on frozen 2 advertisements. Then I order 2 Caramel Mocha  Coffees. After about 3min of waiting the kid behind the counter tells me the machine broke he needs to get the manager. Come to find out the machine is on auto-clean and it will be 18min before our coffee is ready. Not wanting to wait around they tell me they can give me two regular coffees. When I tell them that regular coffee is 1$ a cup and I was charged 7.58$ for two specialty coffees they offer to make up the difference in food. That's nice and all, but we did not want nor need any food. I ask for just a refund at that point. Mind you this whole ordeal takes almost the 18min for the machine to finish cleaning but by now I just wanted to get out of there. The staff were all very young and seemed very poorly trained. While they were nice and tried to make it right, I think better training of the employees at this location is necessary. While waiting for my refund I watched multiple other customers receive the wrong order or had issues with their food. I dont often go to McDonald's but continued visits with poor service has definitely left a bad impression!",Negative
They have the worst service. I went there yesterday and i ordered a sausage McGriddle add cheese and bacon. They gave me a biscuit and i told them the correct order. They told me to park and we waited about 10 min and they gave us the sandwhich but it was a bacon and egg McGriddle . I told them the order again. I waited another 10 minutes and like 3 people came out and asking what my order was and the manager said oh an egg McGriddle like no...where did i say anything about eggs in my sandwhich and that took more time. It took 4 people to get the order right. Not to mention the wait. And on other days i come here the drive thru wait time is 20 min to 1hr. I used to work there and it is literally the worst location and it,Negative
Will never eat there,Negative

"The locations looks great and has 8 of machines that allow you to order and pay, but the service was horrible. I ordered a sundae for my mom and after 10 minutes of waiting, I saw one employee feel a tear in her pants below her butt and then she went and fixed herself a sundae and left. At this same moment another came up and asked about the sundaes for his family that he ordered 20 minutes prior. I was given a refund without fuss before leaving. The bad part to all of this was there were about 12 people working at the location during my visit which was more than enough to prepare and delivery the food quickly.",Negative
Spent over 30 minutes waiting in line at the drive thru at around 9 pm. Finally placed my order of 2 egg mcmuffins. Recieved 2 egg mcmuffins that must of been sitting since the morning hours from breakfast. The white portion of the egg was almost black.

They have new self serve order kiosks but they are very difficult to navigate. They are not very intuitive at all. My order took three times as long to be brought out. Good idea on the kiosks but very poor execution. While I was waiting on my order they had to come and tell two different people that they were out of what they ordered (fish sandwich and something else). Store was newly renovated inside and out and looked very nice but I will not be back.,Negative
The automated machine didn't print us a receipt so I told one of the employees who was nice enough to look up the number.  The problem was I had no reference to chek the order.  I spent almost 50 dollars for 3 kids and 2 adults.  I walked 5 blocks to get that food bbn order and when I got back to our job I discovered we were missing chicken nuggets and all the dipping sauces.  I ordered 6 sauces and we got none.  It really pisses me off because they always leave stuff out when we order large orders.  It's like they can only handle it if u have a simple meal.  It's so frustrating and plus it's like throwing 10.oo out the window..  you really need to be better about training your workers.,Negative

Worst McDonald's I have ever been to. Staff was rude and disinterested and playing around with each other and getting drinks and walking around outside while customers waited forever for food. All booths were dirty and the chicken nuggets were exceptionally inedible. Almost like they were dropped in oil twice to be reheated. I had to give a star to write a review otherwise they would've gotten a zero.,Negative
Let me put it this way... GETTO. Most of the employees are on the phone and acting like they are at the park. Need to be more Profesional and get this place more clean. Frys taste like old oil. Macdonald fix this place please! The place is nice just need to work on your employees.,Negative

"I'm from a foreign place and I just happened to stop in this McDonalds for a quick bite. These are the things I noticed. #1. Active on site security inside the establishment. I felt like I was being scrutinized. I assume shady things go on here. #2. I found out this McDonalds is located in an area called skid row. #3. The price of the food here is above the average price of the rest of the united states of america. #4. There isn't really a lot of friendly interaction between the clerk and the guest as well. For the most part this is what I gathered from this place. Taking into account that it was the first and only time I've been there. Not a good representation for Los Angeles for it being so close to the Greyhound bus station portal. If its any consolation , I received my food hot and it was good.",Negative
"Service was good, but to many druggies hanging out",Negative

"Place was not noticeable based on the Google maps direction, I ended up looking for a while for it because it is missing the iconic double arches people know. I was looking within the mall area because of the map description, and wished I was across the street as it would have been easier to see. When I entered to place an order, one of the cashier's had an upset look or scowling face towards most customers, and unfriendly look. I didn't like her look so I stepped to the next cashier and I ordered it was fast, I ordered a Happy Meal and was asked if this is for a boy or girl (assuming a toy choice here). I get the order, no toy! And asked all they said was ""no toy, sorry"". I left, I'm not surprised by the lower than usual reviews here. Also when eating my food I ordered triple cheese burger but got doubles instead, at least I was charged for double only.",Negative

This McDonalds forces customers to use the new machines. I couldn't order a large orange juice on my breakfast meal so I asked an employee for help. She didn't know how to order that from the machine either. She told me just order the small and that she would get me a large. While I'm waiting for my order another employee (I think it was the manager) told me I owed 50 cents for the large orange juice. She seemed annoyed with me and maybe the young girl too because we didn't know how to order the large OJ  I paid the 50 cents but was unhappy with how unfriendly and the whole experience was. I won't be back to this particular McDonalds.,Negative
I was waiting more than 10 minutes for a small frappe. They only put a little bit of caramel. It wasn no M. Bad service in this mackdona,Negative

"For a prime, busy, tourist filled location, the processes and procedures at this McDonalds are absolutely terrible.  Many of the self-ordering machines do not work, when you use a normal line with a cashier, it's like the employees have never even been to a McDonald's before as they don't even know the menu items (I ordered traditional chicken nuggets meal, so it wasn't pasta, or some sandwich that only special locations have).  When you order at a kiosk, you can order things they do not have such as a waffle cone ice cream.  Then you wait 15+ minutes to find out they don't have waffle cones and wait for an employee to make a fresh one, which she doesn't know how to do so you end up paying $4+ for a cup of ice cream.  I did get my money back for the ice cream because I couldn't believe it took that long.  Don't bother going here; it's not worth it, unless you want to feel like you're waiting at Disney at a subpar place.",Negative

The most important thing is The only one staff seems so mad at work. When she doing the fries,one empty fries bag dropped on the floor,she got so pissed  threw a whole bunch fries bag on the floor.

"After decades of serving families, McDonald's is on their way out. I blame it on the district managers not doing their jobs. McDonald's needs individuals who can read, comprehend and speak English. Today I went there for lunch. I ordered #6 Filet-o-Fish sandwich meal. I ended up with 10 peice chicken nuggets. Hmmmm....I  guess the order taker did not know the menu item or understand when I said Filet-o-Fish sandwich. I quickly caught the error and told the cashier. She said, ""So you don't want it?"" Then, the manager came along to find out what the problem was. I  explained and received the sandwich. I left and when I  got home, I found out I  had a frosted breakfast pastry in a ,Filet-o-Fish box! Come on now McD's. May we get better service and expect a lot more from you?

"Very rude employee taking orders"" slammed the window in my face and left and  didn't charge me, also called the manager and the manager was worst than the employee, beware of this location this people are rude and very far from being polite- horrible experience, staffsocks.",Negative
Why did I ever think think that McDonald's had anything good for cheap. The best thing is their overpriced fries. The burger mouth feel was like tofu. I hope millennials kill ol' McDonald with their healthy spending habits.,Negative
"Same ol"" ready in 2 minutes food. Idk how they do it . But ramen needs to step up their game because it takes longer to cook noodles in the microwave . Great Job Mickey D's",Negative
"An abysmal excuse of a restaraunt, this location is a McDonalds only in name. With a wait time of 10-15 minutes at best for even the simplest order this location completely and utterly fails in its purpose as a fast food location. I strongly recommend any reader to take their time and money to ANY other location.",Negative
"The service was TOTALLY slow and it took the clerk about 5 minutes before they could even take an order.  I'm a local and I wouldn't ever go back to this location again. Seemed like a LOT of chaos happening when I looked in the kitchen area.  Also, clerks do NOT have a basic understanding of English. This is difficult if you're trying to ask anything of the clerk.  Would not recommend.",Negative
No open  on time 4am.  20 minutes late todas los dias.no good,Negative
"Horrible, slow, and unhelpful.",Negative
The late night service is terrible!!! Waited in line for an hour before I was able to place an order! Someone needs to fix this system or hire new staff.,Negative
"You enter the bathroom and there is no soap to wash, there is no paper to clean yourself. The hamburger is good but they deliver it to you with the black lettuce, which for me is rotten. The fries are potato fries ..... I returned them twice because they taste like oil from 7 days ago ... very low",Negative
Producing fatty and unhealthy food to the masses. McDonald's is a blight for any neighborhood and caters to providing saturated fatty foods.,Positive
No restroom bad service,Positive
Poor ,Negative
I only went cause my dad wanted to go. I don't favor fast food,Negative
"Absolute free for all inside. A automated factory that completely doesn work. People waiting over 45 min for their food, nearly every order was wrong, and staff just literally ignoring the countless customers complaining. The manager had no control over his staff who blatantly ignored him to the point he was telling customers their names to report. This place simply doesn work and is utter chaos. $40, almost an hour, and wrong food, with no one to care",Negative
Unfortunately it's not got any better. The first time visiting this trip and they got my order wrong.... I didnt have much faith to begin with to be honest. The attention to detail here is lacking. And $5 for a latte is unreal.... Tourist trap central. Cross the road to checkers and get good food at a low price,Negative
"Given too many chances. I've tried to be polite no matter how rude the staff. Tonight I gave 1 more chance. My order was taken down wrong so I confirmed at the second window before taking the food. The woman was very upset she had to remake it, made it clear with snatching and attitude told me to pull over and when i got my order it was wrong AGAIN. Also took items  and was charged for adding lettuce.",Negative
"Hi,

I have just purchased medium fries and large chocolate shake. I did not feel hygiene because they are cleaning their kitchen and they are serving at the same time with the same unclean hands without washing and without having gloves. Guys please maintain some hygiene levels while serving customers.占쏙",Negative
"Manager on duty was very rude.  My husband went today to pick up a missing item from order from the previous night that they forgot to give us.  Instead of going above and beyond to correct their mistake and guarantee excellent customer service, she proceed to interrogate my husband rudely.  In today's world where there are so many options to eat, you think that people would put their best foot forward to make sure their customers have a good experience. I WILL NEVER spend my hard earned money at that location EVER AGAIN",Negative
"The biggest waste of time and money. Way to packed. Unorganized. There was barely a line when we got to McDonald's yet we still waited over an hour for 2 bacon mcdoubles, a big Mac, a bacon chicken ranch (they forgot the bacon when it's literally IN THE TITLE) and 4 medium fries. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING was cold and disgusting. Spent way more money than it should have been. Will NOT be going back there. The kids didn't even want to play in the play area because they ended up getting hurt. Poorly set up and no security or anything. They were being pushed and shoved by other children and no one was doing anything about it.",Negative
"Bad service, cold food. I didn't get my complete order and had guide the staff multiple times to complete the order.",Negative
"Service was terrible I had to wait for ever to get my food, then when I finally did it was a security guard who gave it to me that was behind the counter for what ever reason he didn't have on gloves he put his dirty finger in my cup when he pulled it out the group of cups I won't be going back to this location the staff speaks spenglish I can barely understand what they trying to say I didn't get sauce for my biggest it's just terrible service on top of the 75 school kids in there standing around waiting for their orders",Negative

"To be honest I퐉 not a fans of fast food , I really eating when I퐉 running out of choice, but I really appreciated than in Mc Donald you have the opportunity to use the bathroom which is very convenient for people like me who spend a lot time on the road , I also believe when I go to a place I have to leave it better than I founded, with that been said I when to this location last night 04-04 -19 at 10:00 pm to use the bathroom , the bathroom is located in the second floor ,some part of the room ",Positive
Poor ,Negative
They was so unpleasant at pickup,Negative
Poor ,Negative
What is the point in having employees in a store if they don't help you? The employees talking to each other and when you want to place an order they tell you to place it on the machine. The store was empty! What are they there for if the machine is going to take your order? They are getting paid to chit chat? Bad customer service.,Negative
"We went to this mcdonalds to grab a quick bite, first of all the service was horrible, they do not know what they are doing. Second the food was cold. Third the place looks dirty, dirty tables and floors, a lot of people coming by the table asking for money. I will never go back to this mcdonalds",Negative
"The McDonald's buy the zoo... pictures say it all.   Food and drinks spilled all over the floor and tables, trash overflowing.  Don't even go in the bathrooms... yikes!!!!  There wasn't a clean table in the whole place!

Everyone was hiding in the back so nobody to take our order for almost 7 minutes.   Had I walked around and noticed the mess, we would have left.

As I'm writing this, I noticed there is a wrapper glued to my shoe.   The only nice person was the homeless lady sitting in the corner.

Don't eat here unless you want to get Ebola",Negative
"THE FOOD WAS OK
THE CUSTOMER SEVICE WAS EXTREMELY OFF POINT RUDE CASHIER N MANAGER",Negative
Terrible food and terrible service. While waiting at the window someone started yelling at the employee in which he stopped to yell back and call her a bit** and tell her that someone named bebe won't be in till 5. Highly inappropriate and I felt I should have drove off which would have been the better decision. No one should ever go here and they should rethink the staff,Negative
"The nuggets from this location were the WORST I've ever had! Unfortunately I didn't taste them until I'd gotten back to my room, otherwise I'd definitely have asked for my money back.",Negative
Food always cold and always mess up the order,Negative
"I rarely eat at mcdonalds but for convenience and the 40 min drive I had to take home I decided to give it a shot, it was 10:20 pm and went to the drive thru, the lady told me that ""they were not going to take orders until 11 p.m"" but it says 24 hrs isn't it? While I gave the round about I saw all the staff just sitting and chilling in the dining area... look I understand it's not the best job, but at least try... anyway do not try to go between 10-11 pm because you are not going to be attended",Negative
Super long lines,Negative
Horrible line and service!,Negative
I spent more time waiting for my food than what it took me to eat it. 28min,Negative
Not open 24/7,Negative
Too bad I only bought two coffees and it took me more than 19 minutes and they still moved me to the parking lot and then I had to return because they didn't take what I bought with them lousy service,Negative
"This place is a total wreck most of the time. This is an extremely busy location and I've been going here for years as a customer and also as a delivery driver and it's astonishing that pandemic or not, they still have the same issues. They are never prepared to maintain the volume of business. You often have to repeat yourself multiple times when communicating with the staff. If you go at night (particularly late-night) there's likely to be a long line in drive-thru or inside. They regularly claim their ""system is down"" and so are unable to accommodate you. It's completely upsurd. I don't understand how any establishment can think that this mode of operation is acceptable. Other than that, typical McDonald's.",Negative
"Seriously this is the absolute worst service I've ever had. The manager, is lazy and we sat in the drive thru for 15 damn minutes. We pulled up to the first window, and he opens the window and sits there talking and completely ignored us. Then we pay and pull up to the 2nd window and literally, 3 employees are sitting there talking. We're at 15 minutes and counting and still sitting at the 2nd window. All for 2 hash browns and a sandwhich.",Negative
The apple pies here were the worst. It was like biting into a regular apple. The only thing cooked was the outside. The inside was cold and the apples were hard. I went there 12/26/18 to get happy meals for my daughters and their fries were too hard to eat. I won't be going back there. I only went to reward the girls for cleaning their room and helping around the house for 2 weeks. (This was their choice of reward for good behavior),Negative
"We are staying at the hotel next door. My husband checks online to make sure the restaurant and dining room are open. They are. He walks over and the doors are locked. Walks back to the hotel, takes his car through the drive through, sits for 10 minutes and receives no service although there were employees in the restaurant. He sees other cars trying to receive service but they are all being ignored. He comes back to the hotel and calls again, at least 6 times, each time it says the number is disconnected even though he had already confirmed they were open through the same number earlier. Finally someone answers the call, he asks if they are open and they said no, he asked them why they answered the phone and were in the restaurant at 1am if it is closed, they said because their job is just to answer the phone. Its clear that the employees wanted to get paid for working all night without serving any customers. My husband used to work in fast food, and I wanted to believe that the stereotypes of McDonalds employees being terrible people and workers to not be true, but this location makes the company look bad. McDonald's should fire the franchise owner, or shut this location down, because they clearly dont know how to hire dependable employees.",Negative
I Placed my order on the app on 7/21/21 and paid for meal through the app when I got close to the restaurant I place my order after arriving 10 minutes later my order was still not ready I stood at the pick up counter and had to fine someone to help me which took another five minutesThere was absolutely no one at the counter to help,Negative
Too much waiting seems like the staffs don't know how a fast food restaurant suppose to be run. On top of the wait they forget items that you pay for so make sure to ask for a receipt if something not right with this McDonalds please report it call and complain.,Negative
The lobby guy is friendly but coughing by people who are eating. Staff were not friendly about no longer being able to take verbal orders and only using the kiosk.,Negative
Severely understaffed for such a busy location. I've seen McDonald's with more workers in locations in the middle of nowhere. Expect to wait at least an hour for food and make sure to check your order before leaving as I and at least half of the patrons I saw leaving came back missing something.,Negative
"What is it with McDonalds? I made an a order the cashier made a mistake told me to drive around again!

I spoke to the Manager he waived the fee on the mix up of menu then we sat outside 15 minutes in Las Vegas heat waiting for the food.

This place may be good for a walk in not drive through.

It a simple order how are is it to get it right.

They're supposed to serve breakfast until 11am but they stop WAY before that.  Not cool.,Negative
30 minutes in drive thru.... Ridiculous,Negative
"Everytime I go here they seem to have an issue with charging for ranch. Today a told them at the speaker box twice I wanted a total of 3 ranch. Which honestly, I could use five or six. When I got to the second window I only found one. It was a manger serving me. I explained to her that I asked for a total of 3 ranches. She hands me 1 and proceeds to tell me I was not charged for it. Annoyed I grab the change and explained to her I ask for extra everytime and it ends up like this. At this point the manager quickly grabbed 2 more and rushed me off. I understand I was not charge, I am willing to pay the extra dollar or 2 for extra. Please dont be rude to me cause I like enough sauce for my nuggets.",Negative

I ordered 20 spicy,  40 reg, picked out at least 9 different dipping sauces as ""required "" not to mention Desired by my kiddos!! We did NOT get ONE sauce or even a ketchup!!! Just to make sure they were consistant with disregard, they didn't even give us straws either to go with our $3 mango smoothies...2 of them! So, 60 Nuggets-NO sauces  AT ALL!  Not the first time they have done us wrong on the Nuggets so buyer should be cautious!",Negative

"Went today after the zoo, it was a very bad experience to say the least.
We were given over seasoned  fries, one straw for three drinks, and the drinks were all bad.
I thought how do you mess up a drink?
It is my belief that this was attributed to the mistake that was made with coffee order wanted moca frap was given hot coffee.
She took all drinks back and brought tray back with correction.
It tasted like instead of coffee mixture it was blended with old filtered out deposits, I mean really sour.
The manager however corrected the moca and recooked fries.
When we left a second time I tasted the unsweetened tea and Coke... It was horrible foul I thought omg I almost served this to my kids!!
Will not ever return.",Negative
Poor ,Negative
"It was bad enough when the dining room soda machine converted to the one nozzle machine, but they also did it to the drive thru. So now all their soda tastes nasty. I thought McDonald's was supposed to have great tasting sodas, not sodas that taste like suicides. Not to mention their staff can't figure out basic orders and there's a 90% chance your order is going to be wrong in some way. Added with the homless going up to every person, this spot used to be okay and nows it's more like the last resort.",Negative

Kept hanging up on me and everytime i called back there was a new girl claiming to be the manager, and they are all disgustingly rude. Im actually shocked by how they treat other humans like this. I came in earlier at 8:30 and the guys working there were very nice, but calling at 11:30 pm i was not treated even decently by all the girls in there.

HORRIBLE! It took 54 mins to get our food and then it was nasty. We watched the manager mix sweet and unsweet to fill a mans tea. Noone ever asked for our order so we pulled forward at the window. Will NEVER stop at this location on our way home from Seaworld. EVER!,Negative

Told the gentleman to hold one moment and 5 seconds later a girl came on. Like give us a minute.

"Worst McDonald's I've ever been to. On Friday, February 17th, it was closed at 9:41pm. Wth? Really? Couldn't believe it. Staff that turned me away wasn't very polite either. What is this?

45 min wait - 17 spicy nuggets in the boxes, no sauces despite the machine asking what sauces we want. Drinks are just cups, despite the machine asking what we want - self service downstairs with no instructions on how to get the milkshake we ordered as only soda fountains at the stations etc

Nuggets were over cooked, Like properly crunchy/jerky texture

Fries were literally stone cold, not even warm

Our kid loved the play centre but this isn't worth paying twice the price of a regular McDonald's for just plain terrible food and no service at all",Negative

I then stepped outside to get my friends and tell them our food was ready, they took the tray and headed up while I put our other friend in an Uber. When I came back in security who had just been no more then 5 feet from me while I ordered, paid, and received my food, made someone come down to confirm that I was a paying customer.

"The employee's are nice, location is always dirty. Tables have to be clean more often. The food quality has gotten better.",Negative
The problem is with these Mexican cashiers.When they have s Mexican customer they all know each other.So after they order.They chit chat.Even when it busy..plus they get better customer thsn the Whites do.And that to me is discrmmation,Negative
Used drive-thru around 2am just to find out that they were only taking cash because the card terminal was not working. I only had a few bucks cash to spend and I even got my oder wrong. Terrible experience!,Negative
Worst service I ever experienced. I ordered one thing but cashier decided to sell me double of what he thought was better. When I asked for my money back Angel the shift manager was very rude verbally and physically. I will never be going to that establishment again.,Negative
The food is cold and I continue to get the wrong order.,Negative
Well i order a crispy chicken sandwich small fry and a coke. Normally I look in the bag this time I just reached in for a fry. When I get home I find 10 piece nugget two BBQ sauces and a double cheese burger. I was to far to go back so I ate 5 nuggets and half the burger. Check your food people I was very disappointed but my dogs were thrilled.,Negative
"Dirty place, noisy employees and they took the order wrong",Negative
"Too much tarter sauce on fish fillet
Cheeseburger buns hard & stale",Negative
"Worst customer service ever!! I was invited to come in after having to wait over 45 minutes on the drive thru. Manager Priscilla calls me to apologize and invites me back with my family, I explained I cannot come back next day, but would come following Sunday, she agreed and hung up. On Sunday I come to the restaurant and there is another manager Cynthia who I explained the situation and she grunted the whole time she took the order. While on the service line, she tries to contact the manager and right there from behind the line, she asks me yelling, what is your name, I tell her and again in front of EVERYONE, other customers included, yells again, ""she tells me you came in already!!"" I replied NO, at this point I'm embarrassed and upset and I hear her that she tells the person on the phone I already put it down. Twenty minutes later, I finally get the order. I ask her to change the fries on some of the things that were ready because they were cold. The manager grunts and agrees to. After my family were done with their meals, we had ordered ice cream and we asked to hold off until we were done. When we returned, we asked for the ice cream and we had asked for chocolate, they said that we had ordered vanilla and the manager gave us one less of what we ordered. Incredible! Bottom line, we were invited to come back to make it up for bad service and McDonald's came through, we got yelled at by the manager, embarrased, long wait for food, missing food items, and pissy attitude by staff. Next time I get invited back I guess I gotta read the fine print or ask for what am I invited to come back for. Sorry that we don't have negative stars because this location would take them all.",Negative
McDonald's seems to be the meeting place for homeless and mentally ill people in NYC. I don't know why ?,Negative
No electric outlets to charge phones!!!!  This McDonald location is falling back hard. The staff have very poor work ethics. Tattoos and lack of respect are prominent here.,Negative
Poor ,Negative
No Hot n' Spicys? Employees are not there to assist customers.,Negative
Who idea was it to destroy the famous zoo McDonalds ??? I hope revenue sales go down the drain.,Negative
"If I  could give this location a zero on customer service, I  would. Pulled into drive through at 8:07 and placed a simple order. I order a regular hamburg and cookies. Once I paid and pulled up to the window to pick up, I  was told to pull up to the #1 space. I sat there and sat there and.........25 minutes later, no order. I  went in and no one was at the counter. I yelled ""hello"" three times. A young lady came up asking who was handling the front counter. A young girl appeared. To make this complaint shorter, I  showed my receipt and another 5 minutes later I got my order. There was another order with a drink sitting on the counter that never got to the person who ordered it. After getting home, I  had no regular hamburg but had cookies. Everyone, don't even bother going to this location again. It's a horrible experience every time as you can see by other reviews.",Negative
"Unreal, this mcdonalds is garbage. It was cool when it had zoo themed but came back home to visit to find my favorite mcdonalds right off the highway near the new tarnished. Service is always lackluster at best and usually can be very messy inside since the remodel",Negative
"My son got a vanilla milkshake it looked soupy and he tasted it and he said it had a off taste to it I told him throw it away, in a few minutes he was sick to his tummy . So beware .",Negative
You know why this McDonalds is rated so low? It's because they have 6 ITEMS ON THE MENU EXCLUDING FRIES AND DRINKS! This place is trash! Had to wait 30 minutes in line just go get 2 quarter pounders and 2 fries! If you're in Miami I'm warning you do not go here! There's much better places in Miami to eat then this garbage.,Negative
Only as a last resort,Negative
"The only reason I give this place a one is because there isn't a 0 option this is the WORST McDonald's I've ever been to.  The staff is RUDE.  We had to wait 20 minutes to order when there wasn't anyone else in line.  Couldn't use the bathroom until we showed a receipt and then there was no toilet paper.  A worker brought paper towels up,  said there was no toilet paper and let his girlfriend jump in line in front of me to use the bathroom. Couldn't even get in the men's bathroom the door was locked and you couldn't get in there.  Told the staff about it and they could care less I've never been treated so poorly.  The guy that was guarding the stairs to the bathroom was a poor excuse for an employee and McDonald's is wasting their money on paying someone to treat customers poorly.",Negative
Fries were cold and I ordered a Large size ($2.80+tax) that was only filled half way. I asked them if they could please fill them up and she literally put just a few more on top and when I stood it up it was just a little over half way now. They wouldn't even pass the edge of the front part. When I showed it to her she got annoyed and closed the window. Very rude employees,Negative
"Use the drive through to order. The girl gave me the wrong flavor soda. I told her what i ordered and she gets angry and says ok, pull up to the next window for your soda.
I say no, I'll wait here, please just give me my soda. She would rather argue then just fill the cup with soda. She tells me that I'm making everyone in the drive through wait. I said no McDonald's sloppy order taking is making me wait. I encourage everyone to not pull up out of the way when fast food restaurants screw up. They do that so ""corporate"" doesn't yell at them for having slow initial order to window pickup time. Do the job right and orders will be fast.",Positive
"Pretty bad salad. This was the second time the salad was not fresh at all. Turning brown.
Manager was nice enough to have another one made and refund. But not worth the wait.",Negative
They missed half my order and I tried giving them a call but they sent me straight to voicemail or would answer and just leave the phone there this is by far the worst food chain I have ever been to and pretty much just stole my Money,Negative

"McDonald's quality, What can I say the quality taste and preparation have gone straight down the toilet. Of the 3, taste is suffered the most. there.  fries used to be the best now they're the worst  It's so bad I try to use McDonald's as a last resort.      The last resort",Negative
Bad service gave us sparkling water instead of sprite also it takes about 45 minutes to just get a vanila cone and your food,Negative

I walk into the store in Roanoke TX and the employee is sitting on the counter and leaning on the cups with his but touching them I wonder where else he's been sitting at maybe where the food is made.,Positive
"Really didn't care much for the area...

Homeless people in and outside of this restaurant. (Not that I dont like them) but made me feel very uncomfortable eating meal with my small child. The lady that took my order overcharged me.... The food tasted great. Even put a Happy meal toy with my big Mac .. but I'm not complaining everyone loves Olaf!  Restaurant has recently been remodeled and seemed fairly clean. I probably won't go back. But it was okay.",Positive
"Good morning, Please tell me if this matters or if I'm being to sensitive or petty or overly concerned. Maybe because I didn't have my coffee this morning.

I patronize this McDonalds in Oak Park every morning. This morning I forgot my wallet. I asked the Supervisor if I could pay them the less than $5.00 breakfast tomorrow. They said so sorry No. I pleaded with this new manager that I'd never seen before. I asked for the manager that I'd spoken with on several occasions.
She refused to see me, and he stated that her response would be the same!!! I asked him what was to happen to food on the counter in front of us. He said it would be discarded!!!!

Seriously, I asked. So, I said that you'd rather throw it away then let me have it, a faithful customer.....So my lesson is now, Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson. McDonalds doesn't care about my patronizing their establishment and I'm going to seriously break my coffee habit. No more McDonalds from Oak Park on Madison for me.
A lesson well learned, can you believe my feeling was hurt when he said that my breakfast was to be discarded.",Negative
Unless u got a half-hour to spend in the drive thur.  Go for it .,Negative
"burgers are like rubbers, they taste awful, i felt i am eating not fresh bread. chicken was stretchy , looks like it was made to last for ever.",Negative
Pulled up to the drive through. Never got anyone to take my order. Car pulls into other com spot instantly get order taken. I wait some more a second and third car goes through the order. I sat there 3 or 4 minutes and 3 cars on the other side before I pulled away. Never had this problem at this before and I go here once a week bc I work down the road. But I will not return because it's nonsense. The car before me in that lane got there order through no problem.,Negative
"Worst McDonald on planet earth!! Sloppy service, dirty, limited selection on the menu. I believe mc Donald is losing millions with this place.
Once I ordered a double quarter pound and got a single. Once I ordered a single and got a double. One night I order a quarter pound but they had no more so I order a cheese burger and had no more I just left the place.
Also after a certain time they only serve large meals, no small nor medium.",Negative
"Went thru the drive thru, for breakfast. I like the Egg McMuffin meal, but that is about the only thing I'll eat off of their menu. My meal with a coke, ended up being wrong. They gave me a sausage biscuit and the coke was horrible. The line was so long, that I did not have time to wait, so I just threw it all away. I won't be coming back to this location.",Negative
I bought two hamburgers it cost me $6,Negative
Be careful. Rude sketchy employees.They will try to tell you at certain times of nite every order has to be upsized to a large. Food was cold and horrible after a long wait. Then you still will be  GROSSLY OVERCHARGED. Crooks. USE THE APP TO BE CHARGED CORRECTLY.,Negative
Would leave zero stars but I can. The food is nasty. Re dropped fries and burgers that have been in the heater all day. Only good thing is the lobby stays clean with,Negative

"""Open 24 hours"" we got here at 2.30 am and they say it's not open until 3.30 am. Finally they open at 3.40 am but they wouldn't accept cards, only cash. Then the girl at the cashier, Heidi she said, was attending the register and then going to the kitchen, no gloves, touching the food, so rude and so loud, terrible service here today.",Negative
We had to literally argue with the shift Supervisor to get more creamer and sugar for my coffee. Ill never go there again!,Negative

"2 different visits: The supervisor in the grey shirt was the one give out the food with an attitude like he didnt want to be bothered. And I ordered 4 apple pies at night and all of them were old, dried out, and their box had no sell by time stamped so who knows how long they been in that warmer. Probably will place my food orders elsewhere",Negative
"Unbelievable that everyone else has the same complaint as me...they never get the order right.

Tonight, I realized that they forgot an item after coming home with food for the family. I first tried to call just to get reimbursed...but no one answered the phone.

Then I decided to drive back for a refund while the rest of my food went cold on my dining room table. When I got to the drive thru, I politely asked for a refund for the item they forgot.

Having worked in the food industry myself in the past, the service was awful. For the sheer inconvenience, they should have refunded me and at least offered the missing item to me free of charge. However, all that was given was a refund...not even an apology to go along with it.

Terrible service along with the terrible cold food that I then had to go eat at home (thanks to my having to drive back for a refund).

Mistakes can happen but not as often as they happen here. Do yourselves a favor and avoid this location!!!",Negative
Bad communication when ordering through the drive-thru. When I recommend this place if customer service is important to you.,Negative

Ok,Positive
"Absolutely done with this location, I always seem to get the same woman at the drive-thru I don't know her name but I know her voice and she screws up every single time then when I try and correct her she gets mad and acts like it's my fault. I don't know if she's special needs or something or there's a learning disability or if she's hard of hearing I don't get it. And even lately when I hear it's her I actually make sure to enunciate clearly but it doesn't seem to help. The young man that I occasionally get is always on point he has never messed up an order. I'm guessing she is related to management or has incriminating photos or something. She has absolutely no people skills and I will not go back to this place",Negative

Gery bad service,Negative
Awful food,Negative
"The morning crew seems fast and efficient. Night crew is a whole different experience, lines down the street, hour long waits. If this was a one time occurrence it wouldn't be so bad but this is a nightly problem. Beyond this the staff is so highly rude you leave wanting to crash your car through the building. Don't forget they will mistake your order almost every single time as well and serve it to you cold.",Negative
Poor ,Negative
Food is always cold and takes forever.,Negative
This has GOT to be the worst McDonald in America. I live next ,Negative
"Terrible at the night. Staff is unfriendly and sometimes rude, when after 40 minutes of waiting, I asked where my order was, a guy named Gustavo just turned away and left.  They say that they have a lot of orders and few people.  Firstly, at least two people there only did what they went back and forth, but they could help other employees to speed up the process.  But my god, why should the service suffer from this?  Hire more people for the weekend.  Or did you not guess that people come to you on Saturday night? Supervisors need to conduct trainings for staff, otherwise they forgot how to communicate with customers and how the company makes money.  And in the end, where is your smile?  Or are the good old days of smiling gone?",Negative
Short of help and check your bag for accuracy.,Negative
I asked for fresh fries and nuggets. They were not fresh and I did not receive any sauce. This place is terrible.,Negative

That McDonald's need to change does managers or give them a good training in customer service, courtesy and Ethical!",Negative
"Food tastes gross been eating healthy too long figured I would try them out it has been probably 10 years since I had McDonald's chicken products. It was either old or they figured out how to Nuke girl Chicken in about 30 seconds either way slightly concerning LOL.

this is only a review of the food quality the service at this location seem great and if we could rate businesses categorically then they would have received five stars for customer service and speed",Negative
"When I'm up early in the morning,I can't stop there for early meals,so I'm lead to go to 711 store.",Negative
"Absolutely disgusted with discriminatory management at this location. As I'm charging my phone in back making an order on app because I didnt have my card. The manager, Nancy, request their ""security"" to kick me out. I did absolutely nothing wrong other than charge my phone to make an order.

Not only did their security guard get rude with me they didnt even have the professionalism to let me know it's against rules to charge phone to make an order. Only was charging to phone to make order thru app. Then after getting kicked out they wouldn't give me a refund or my food, said to call number.

Me being black I deal with this a lot. But I hope reviews like this can help wake people up and hold people accountable for discriminatory behavior.

Still want my refund!!!",Negative

Besides, he started yelling at us for sitting for 5 minutes to choose the menu, he even threatened to call the police, he literally ran us out of there, the moment I went to place my order the cashier treated us very badly, I do not recommend it to anyone, the worst McDonald's in New York.
The person who cleans is completely dirty, badly dressed and smells bad aside we started to scream for sitting 5 minutes to choose the menu, even threatened to call the police, we literally ran out of there, the moment I went to place my order the cashier treated us very poorly, I would not recommend to anyone the worst McDonald's in New York.",Negative
Why would you ask me when im ordering if i want any condiment if ur just going to forget them. Fries are raw and my sandwich patty was hard but yet they still some how managed to smush the sandwich in half. Atlest they wore able to get the drink right.,Negative
"Absolutely unprofessional staff, disorganized, and angry. They were so angry and SCREAMING out the numbers into a girl's face angrily. They were talking about jumping a girl. And when I went to order I took a second to take my phone out to show her the deal I wanted and she snapped at me and said HELLO and repeated my order and said OKAY?! I said yeah but I have a deal I want to use. She waved it off and said ""it don't work"". She was snapping her fingers and voice. I literally just got there and she was just already angry standing there. I took my card out to use and she said ""You have cash? That don't work!"" As if I knew. She didn't state it beforehand. What I didn't understand was everyone else before me ordered with a card? So I just told her I don't have cash and walked off the line. I saw people using their cards and when I saw that I got upset. I just got done working a long day and I was tired and hungry and just wanted my McChicken and fries. I got back on line and there was her friend. The friend told me to insert my card. I asked her if it works she said yeah. I said so WHY did the other lady tell me otherwise? Then the lady saw me on line again she said ""I just told her the app don't work why is she asking again?!"" I said ""Actually, you also said the card reader doesn't work and it does so I wouldn't know what's true or not?"" She said ""WHO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE TALKING TO?!"" ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE SERVICE. They both started laughing. There was a pretty big spider walking around on the floor too. All the tables were dirty. And the guy cleaning was on his phone and rapping. And looking at other customers butts. She handed me the food harshly. They're all children. Immature children. Absolutely disrespectful.",Negative

If I can give this place ZERO stars I would! I went through drive through and cashier informed me to wait on line 1. So I drove and parked while I was waiting a lot of vehicles passed through. There was an older lady with red hair giving out deliveries of food so I was wondering when my order was going to come out waiting there for 30minutes or Longer. So I walked inside asking for my order and come to find out that my order was given to someone else! So they had to put my order again through the system so I can get my food so again Now I had to wait for others to come out before mine because my order was last in line. Food wasn't warm once I got it and fries had salt when I ordered no salt. Never coming to this place again if your near by this location I recommend going to the McDonald's on 183 by Taco Bell.,Negative

"I had revise my earlier review, left underneath this new one.

Just had the most bizarre experience. The lady who took my money at the first window seemed to have a problem with me wanting my change back. She FOLLOWED me to the other window, and started harassing me BETWEEN the barriers meant to stop the spread of Covid 19. Multiple times she stuck her face between the windows to berate me. She asked me what else I was waiting for after I got my drink. As I had just given her my money, she shouldn't be handling my food at all, much less trying to talk to me and knew I had a burger. She then closed the window, and started throwing a coniption that I couldn't hear. The then reopened the windows, stuck her face between the barriers and told me she knew what I had ordered. I told her I didn't understand, and she shoved her face further out and repeated she knew what my order was again, closer and more loudly. I don't get it, I've been here many times and gotten my food without any problems. This young lady not only made the food leave a bad taste in my mouth, but she is exposing people to the potential life threatening virus for no reason. Very very poor attitude and dangerous actions because I wanted my change?

Great, they have really turned things around in the last couple years. The service used to be slow and highly inconsistent. These days, despite all the challenges the restaurant industry has faced they overcame whatever had been stopping them from providing the McDonald's Standard, fast food with correct orders. Not sure if they got new management, training, or equipment, but these guys have brought back the Gold (Arch) Standard. Great job team!",Negative
Poor service,Negative
Service was awful,Negative
"I wouldn't recommend McDonalds food to anyone for what should be obvious reasons . Stopping there was not my idea.

"Working for doordash in that area, and everytime I go to pick up a order.  I wait over 30 minutes atleast.  People are just standing around and doing nothing.  I even asked who the manager is, and the lady pointed to the guy sitting down eating.  This hasn't just happened once, it has happened every time!  I don't like to accept orders from McDonald because of this, but I have to make money.  This place needs to get their stuff in gear.  It's a busy place and not really any competition.",Negative

"Worse McDonald's I've been to. I have decided to go a mile further to the Augustine Dr one instead at this point. Constantly slow, missing items or not making them correctly. Ordered for curbside at 8pm, was told restaurant was closed and I need to contact corporate for a refund",Negative
They were not letting homeless people eat or use the bathroom that we're buying food that's wrong,Positive
Chicken sandwiches just lazily thrown together.  Looks really sloppy.  Have to take apart and line it all up and spread out the veggies.  Your typical McDonald's.,Negative

Terrible,Negative
I would  Give this McDonald's 0 stars if I could they don't only forget your sauces for your nuggets but they give you a Burger with a paper still on the Patty cooked with cheese on it. I bit into my Burger and I chewed it right away I tasted the paper.. Took my Burger apart and found the paper that's on the Burger Patty before it's cooked . Be more careful. People could get sick if they eat that.  It would be nice if I could get my money back for this.,Negative

Food was great, but can't really give proper rating cause of this. I enjoy McDonald's, but I getting a bit feed up with the dining closure everywhere. Please do not reply due to pandemic, and safety, due to other establishment being open. I travel a lot on the road and soon will be passing up every McDonald's due to this.

Looks like management has posted a sign, order via kiosk to get a free cookie. My order didn't contain one. I asked the associate, she was puzzled. They had to discuss with 3 other folks and finally one of them gave one with complete displeasure.

Kiosk didn't give a paper bill to provide a direct feedback. With modern tech, they should switch to a sms or email for whoever wants a digital copy.",Negative

They have music as if it were a disco. Here you can not eat you go crazy.,Negative
"Epic McDonald's on International dr. Is lacking customer service.  Had the coupon for free Happy Meal from Visit Florida.  They didn't want to give it to us because we downloaded from site and printed not from tourist booklet.  Then said it was not actually for a happy meal.  Just drink, fries, and burger/nuggets. "" No box, toy, yoghurt or toy""  even though the coupon stated ""HAPPY MEAL""  no small print.  Girl at drive thru wasn't nice.  Prices at epic McDonald's are quite a bit higher than the other locations and no $1,2,3 menu",Negative
"This location is incredible. It has two stories. Has automated machines to order from. You can get a variety of different items to try out that aren't at regular McDonald's. It's always super busy here too so expect a wait.

McDonalds is all about fries...  Please don serve fries that been sitting out for an hour.  Even McDonald corporate has a rule of throwing away old batches every 7 min.  either understaffed or lazy.  Why even hire a manager or use a franchisee who doesn",Negative
Very loud. The managers kids and grandkids were running around the place and causing a mess. Very loud and took forever to get my food. I did not like this place one bit. Maybe if the kids weren't running around doing whatever they wanted itd be better. I recommend going to a different McDonald's their are a few others near by.,Negative
Literally locked the door on my face. I never write reviews but this was so strange. Was attempting to purchase breakfast and there was an employee who physically pushed me out and locked the door. Completely unwarranted given my calm demeanor. Very bizarre.,Negative
"Waited 48 minutes in line, and when it was my turn, they said they only take cash. They could have posted a sign somewhere. Awful.",Negative
"Repeatedly missing items. Repeatedly ignoring allergy restrictions such as simple specifics on orders like no onion, no cheese, etc. overnight is horrible. Overnight Manager identified herself as  crystal on 3/5/23 was not helpful and in better terms, an incompetent woman.",Negative

Lao Mo's attitude towards ordering food is extremely bad! It doesn't matter if you look down on people like a dog leg! Staff with such an attitude please come too!,Negative
Terrible place......debit/credit machines are broken......not organize.......Security was helping the customers not the regular employees of McDonald,Negative
45 mins on a Thursday night.  Nothing makes sense anymore with everything being terrible and no sense of urgency in any aspect of this place.  Fire the whole crew from the manager on down and start over.,Negative
"Don't eat here! Order is always wrong, takes forever, fries are cold and gross. Dining room ""closes"" at 11pm. NOPE! Really closes at like 8pm. Update the hours on your door!!! When we knocked on the door and pointed to the sign, THE MANAGER FLIPPED US OFF!

Cooperate needs to fire most the staff, all the managers, and get new people in there.",Negative

Poor services!!,Negative

"On Nov 22//21, I went to use the men restroom and it was so filthy and because this is a place where a lot people visit the attention to the restrooms should be made more often",Negative
"So, I got to this location frequently, despite hearing the horror stories about this location, because it is close to me. Well, tonight my order was messed up and they yelled at me about it.
First, I tell the person taking my order that I would like a Bacon Double Quarter Pounder w/ Cheese, Tea for the drink, make the combo a large. So, the first thing we have a discussion about is that he gave me an unsweetened tea on the screen. I tell him I would like a sweet tea for the drink, and he tells me that I ordered it wrong. I said, ""Well, normally when I come here, they default to sweet tea."" I said that because they usually do  He said, ""Nah! That's not how we do it. Then, he clears the entire order and puts in a Quarter Pounder with Cheese.

I tell him that I ordered a Bacon Double Quarter with Cheese, sweet tea, and make the combo a large. I saw that it was not right on the screen, but he repeated the order to me correctly.  I pulled around to pay for the order and waited on it to be served to me. I checked the order and told the person at the window that it was not a double. The person at the window talked to the person who took my order, and he came to the window and yelled, ""I MADE WHAT YOU ORDERED."" I told him that I said ""double"" several times when I ordered, 5 times to be exact. He person who took my order, who looked to be a manager, yelled at me, ""NO! IT WAS THE WAY YOU ORDERED IT. YOU ASKED FOR A SINGLE.""

I repeated that I asked for a Bacon Double Quarter with cheese and he started arguing with me about how to order sweet tea. He finally told me that he would make it order, but I did not trust him at this point, so I said that I was leaving and I would not be back.

This was an awful experience and I will not be back. I will also tell my friends and family to avoid this location despite that it has served our community over 10 years.",Negative
I ordered a Big Mac meal sized medium and a 10 pc; I got a double cheeseburger and actually 5 McNuggets. Got robbed for nearly 10 dollars. Never again.,Negative
"I never ever go here because it's the most incompetent McDonald's I've ever seen operate. I ran the drive thru in NYC when I was 17 so I know a thing or two about the process and how it's really not rocket science but somehow they can't ever get it right. Unfortunately for me my husband picked up dinner for me from there and I very Unfortunately didn't specify which one to go to... although this one is closest to home I will drive all the way to Altamonte to avoid it, and the way gas prices are that should tell you all you all need to know. Tonight it was missing fries (we ordered a total of 6 whole items so I can see how that was overwhelming to this bunch) and freezing cold fries which I have no idea how you can even do since even if it been under the warmer for a while... stone cold fries? I wouldn't put it past them they kept them on a counter somewhere instead though. And on top of that I made the mistake of asking for extra pickles on my big mac which I'm sure put this kitchen in a frenzy so they just threw all the ingredients in the box so I can do my own assembling of it... which was probably for the best because who knows what chaos it would cause for them to assemble it. I would be embarrassed to own this place. Don't go here... I know it's fast food and we shouldn't expect much but Altamonte Mcds never dissapoints. Trust me it's worth the drive.",Negative

Horrible!!! We waited 1 hour in line to get mediocre food. We were told they were understaffed,Negative
Just close it down. Worst service ever. It's a tourist based Mcdonalds so they know most customers are a one time customers. But I live in Miami Beach. I hate this place so much for lack of care and customer service. And they know corporate or management doesn't care. Makes me not want to go to any Mcdonalds anywhere at all.,Negative
Every two seconds the door flings open with another customer and you freeze to this cold weather. On top of that the bathrooms require a token to be inserted and can  be obtained by anyone at the registers free of charge. Meanwhile there are fully unlocked and working bathrooms on the second floor that everyone can use. The worse part was that the entire staff was Mexican and did not speak one word of English to each other. As a matter of fact they were laughing and having a great time in their own language while taking my order which is extremely rude to me and to other customers.,Negative
"It was really bad, the chicken wasn't good, didn't salt fries, forgot the sauce, and when I ask for it, he gave it to the person next to me!",Negative

We drive up to get our food and the person was pleasant enough. The food now left a lot to be desired. French fries were not fresh. They had zero salt. We ordered a 10 piece of chicken nuggets and got eight pieces. Then on top of that they're old and stale and cold. Needless to say we will never be going there again.",Negative

4+ service tho",Negative
"This location is wack.
They will literally stop taking orders and make people sit in the parking lot for like 12 minutes until 3:00 a.m. so that they don't get to order dinner food anymore.
We have gone multiple times right after leaving the pinballz arcade just to sit in the parking lot in the Drive-Thru line waiting while they do nothing but wait for the order menu to change over.
Look McDonald's if I wanted a breakfast deluxe I wouldn't have shown up at 2:30 in the morning thank you.",Negative
"Ordered 2 cheeseburgers with no pickles. I got 2 burgers with no cheese and pickles. The establishment itself was clean kept and had a nice interior update to it.

The employees at this location are ridiculously lazy. It's 6pm and the drive-thru menu is still on the breakfast side. It shouldn't take more than 2 minutes to flip the menu over to the lunch side.,Negative

Didn't have any more packs of peanuts for the sundaes... Disappointing and this is at 7 pm!,Negative
"I live close so I frequent this location. They almost always get my very simple order wrong and they can't even use the most basic forms of respect such as speaking to a customer. They just take the card, hand it back(most of the times without the receipt) and at the next window hand you your incorrect order without so much as a word.

"The dirtiest McDonold I have ever been. Waited for 8 mins with no one to serve even though 2 staffs were standing there and see me waiting. The place is so dirty and I am not sure how they pass hygiene. They do not allow to order medium, only large at night. One of my order was not in the bag. When I checked the receipt, I noticed they have placed a wrong order. I told them about it, they said they don have the item and refused to give refunds when I told them I do not want the wrong order. No apology and lie about I ever placed order they put in.  Very rude and ignorant. She did not speak English but deny about putting wrong order and accused me of placing order that I would never have placed. Food was cold and bread was hard as burn. Horrible experience with them and wish McD franchiser will take their license away. It is a disgrace to the brand. The management is so bad and I find the whole experience to be unbelievable. Readck your order but best advice is, NOT to go there at all.",Negative

He practically threw our food in our window while not even looking. Almost dropped our drinks. He was just shoving our food and drinks out his window blindly. I asked him why we had a medium drink he said he didn't know because it was all automatic. The cashier didn't give us our receipt so I asked him if I could get a copy of my receipt. He stormed off and comes back about a minute later shoves the receipt in my face and tells me if I want a copy of my receipt I need to ask at the first window. I just wanted to know about the medium drink otherwise I wouldn't have needed a copy of my receipt or if the cashier would have given me one I wouldn't have had to ask.

I showed up at least 2 hours before the publicly posted closing time, and 30 minutes before the closing time verbally expressed by the cashier. Still, they only had fountain drinks, old coffee, stale mcnuggets, and ONE stale fish filet available. They had decided to clean all equipment and stop making food well before closing. Macy's is a long-respected New York institution. This lackluster and poorly run franchise is a detriment to a great store.",Negative

I am giving 1 star because you can't give a half. I will start driving another 20 min away before I come here again. IF YOU GO THROUGH DRIVE THROUGH CHECK YOU'RE ORDER EVERY TIME 10 out of the last 10 times I did order was wrong. Small fries have more fries then the large. If you order a Big Mack you will either get no mac sauce or more sauce then meat and bread. The staff is horrible drive through sucks and even if you go inside you will have to return to counter atleast 3 times before you get everything. This McDonald's has been here for ever and has been going down hill for the last year.,Negative
Terrible,Negative
"It does not serve terrible customer service through the window, you have to speak English without knowing well, they are spoiled when they deliver things to you, they throw them at you, bad service, change the ones that do not know how to serve the public or they give you the wrong order or they keep telling you what they said",Negative
Very slow in the evening hours,Negative

This place is ridiculously high compared to the McDonald's just down the street. $20 for what is normally $10. On top of it didn't even ask if I wanted any sauces with my chicken McNuggets. Do yourself a favor and drive the extra couple of miles to any other McDonald's,Negative

When I read pies, I think it is all their pies. Nope. Their ""specialty"" pies are more and when you call them out on it they are rude and don't care. Like the customer is supposed to be able to mind read, pies means only apple pie. It was annoying to be treated so rudely over cold mcd pies. If you leadership is so unhappy maybe they should go somewhere that is a happier place. We all have choices.

There is some good leadership at this store and bad. There is no in between. Take your chances. I mainly go there for the tea....when it's good.",Negative
"It took about 40 minutes to get to the window to order the food.. ok... then it took another 10 or 15 to get the food. The lady was very nice, and took my order correctly... the one who served the food, is the one I have a problem  with. Ordered 2 large combos of big mac. Just to get one big mac and a fish fillet...

"Hated my experience going inside, the cashier was flustered and kept messing up, I paid for a large drink but she hands me a medium cup, they were out of ice on both drink fountains and when the manager was told she already knew.  Then someone said we're not out, they're both broken.  So where's the sign letting the customers know?

We ordered 2 doubles, 2 chicken, 1 large fries and 2 large drinks. Everything, every-thing tasted hard like cardboard. The fries were extremely hot and hard and crunchy like stones. Both the chicken and doubles had no - no - no flavor at all and was dry as sawdust and cardboard. For the sodas one was a diet coke and other was a reg coke, both were large size which they did not get right the first time. Both sodas tasted like they were full of cinnamon flavor.

The food was over dry and tasteless. The staff at this location needs to learn how to throw away yesterday's old food..if not last weeks old junk..

It's almost a guarantee your food will taste horrible And your money wasted.. save yourself time and go somewhere else you will be glad you did!",Negative

"horrific service. this is NOT the ""world's largest McDonald's"" as people are reviewing on here, this is the location on international Dr near the OCCC. ordering at the drive thru took almost 20 minutes (this did not include waiting for the food), the man speaking kept whispering and getting an attitude despite us saying we could not hear him, did not correctly take our order, would just not say anything for multiple minutes at a time. i have never in my life been to a McDonald's with worse service. avoid at all costs",Negative
"The McDonald's buy the zoo... pictures say it all.   Food and drinks spilled all over the floor and tables, trash overflowing.  Don't even go in the bathrooms... yikes!!!!  There wasn't a clean table in the whole place!

Everyone was hiding in the back so nobody to take our order for almost 7 minutes.   Had I walked around and noticed the mess, we would have left.

As I'm writing this, I noticed there is a wrapper glued to my shoe.   The only nice person was the homeless lady sitting in the corner.

Don't eat here unless you want to get Ebola",Negative

I can get hash browns at 3:00 pm but cant get fries until after 10:30?? Makes no sense. I ask for manager. She says ""I am the manager""  Really? Then why did you have to go ask about the cheese?  Do you always ASK your emoyees if tthey can put cheese on sonething?  So now she not only gives bad service...but LIES to me about being manager!  I want call from OWNER",Negative
"My order is WRONG every time; the most frustrating customer experience. I live near this new location and have visited 6 times since the remodel, and I've concluded that this location is a 120% mess. If all of my orders are wrong I can imagine thousands of others are driving off with incorrect purchases. I ask for no cheese every time, and guess what is in my order.. CHEESE. Or my frys are half full, or the hashbrowns are completely missing, no syrup/ utensils are in the bag as requested. On 3 occasions we were told to pull ahead and park on the side while they remake my order, an employee brings out an incorrect order.. yes 3 times. Today this ""New"" team member blatantly tells me to go in and take of it... what the hell? Every other time I let the incorrect order slide, but today I decided to speak with the store manager. I let her know politely about all of my incorrect orders, and she replies ""Sorry"", I then ask ""what is mcdonalds doing about this, its every time the order is wrong?"" She responds ""I'm so sorry""... I ask again and same response.  Meanwhile the woman next to me is asking about the replacement order that she put in ten minutes ago, they apologize to her and say they are going to reinput it.... this new location is a joke, its truly insane that a Mcdonalds is operating like this, and its been a few months since their brand new building opened.",Negative

"Seriously, what is the deal with not being able to brew fresh sweet tea? It's sad that you have to check your drinks before you leave the drive thru. It seems as if 3 time a week we get bad tea from this location. It's not like we can just leave work to go get a new one either. We send my hubby on a drink run in the morning and he constantly forgets to take the ""taste test"" before he leaves, but he should not have to!",Negative

"I can honestly say this is the world's worst McDonald's I have so far experienced. A 45-minute wait for a very simple and straightforward order. I've eaten in McDonald's all over the world, and the food quality and service let this one down severely. So many people were angry with ridiculous waiting times, wrong orders, crushed food, and items not available. I do not recommend it!",Negative

He was asked what size he wanted and what to drink as part of the order. They didn't give us fries with our combo meal and when the manager FINALLY noticed me he gave us a medium fry not the large we ordered.",Negative
I wanted to give it zero stars waited over 15 minutes for curbside pick  up  for my order which was 1 sandwich with my sleepy toddler in the car I walked in thought to see if they had it ready and maybe  didn have enough people to bring out because that always the issue at this location but as I walked in bunch of people high-fiving and talking asked for my order and instead of looking for it they wanted me to reorder it some how 1 sandwich got  lost and I am the only one waiting on the curbside  pick up ....  this is very disgusting behavior I unde,Negative

"No cashiers/order takers; you must use their self-service kiosk which they have several of. You take a number sign to your table and staff will deliver your order to your table; however, this wasn't the case for us. The employee came from around the counter and yelled our number while she stood in the nearly empty lobby. We were seated less than 6 feet away from her and in her line-of-sight. We raised our hand and said, ""that's us"". She saw us, but made no attempt to deliver the food. I don't mind getting up and getting the food from her despite the kiosk saying it would be delivered to our table, but, I'm feeling a little like an unpaid employee at this point...we placed the order ourselves as well as served ourselves the food despite paying the same amount for the food that a full-service McDonald's charges. Several people in-store and in drive thru returned food due to being cold, old or not made correctly. This included us...at 1:00 in the afternoon the nuggets were cold, chewy and seemed old. I would think this wouldn't be the case given 1:00 p.m. is during the lunch rush. Fries were cold presumably because they were sitting on the tray well before the rest of the food was ready. Double cheeseburger was made correctly (no mustard or pickles), but bun was not warm/dry and cheese was cold/not melted. 4 managers were in the kitchen (button-up shirts with ties) along with 6 employees yet there was a lot of standing around doing nothing and operating with a shuffle-paced, leisurely-stroll walk. I worked at McDonald's and Burger King as a teenager and was always told, ""If you got time to lean, you've got time to clean"", and that was during slow/dead times, not lunch rush. I will say that the manager I returned my double cheeseburger and fries to (we ended up just eating our stale nuggets because we were told it was going to be 5-10 minutes for fresh ones) was nice and when I told her she could just microwave my burger she insisted on making a new one.",Negative
It's unacceptable to have to wait in the drive-thru for 40 minutes just to order food,Negative
"They did not give me my complete order, I made 3 order  of chicken deluxe and my order was missing fries whet back to made a complain and they were yelling at me and husband, this is not fear to the customer.

I asked the manager and he said the cashier had her hair down in a pony tail because she was almost leaving and the chick with the shirt up was because he shirt got in the way of her cleaning. OH!

This location should have stayed closed. Why do they have a re-opening sign when they're only operating for drive thru. What about the pedestrians? The ones who can't drive? At least I was able to walk in and  order food before they remodeled. I live less than a mile from here and I can't walk over and physically order food? And why is there a parking lot if we can't walk in. And how rude the associate was that I basically should have known better that they were only running the drive thru?

"Good morning, Please tell me if this matters or if I'm being to sensitive or petty or overly concerned. Maybe because I didn't have my coffee this morning.

I patronize this McDonalds in Oak Park every morning. This morning I forgot my wallet. I asked the Supervisor if I could pay them the less than $5.00 breakfast tomorrow. They said so sorry No. I pleaded with this new manager that I'd never seen before. I asked for the manager that I'd spoken with on several occasions.
She refused to see me, and he stated that her response would be the same!!! I asked him what was to happen to food on the counter in front of us. He said it would be discarded!!!!

Seriously, I asked. So, I said that you'd rather throw it away then let me have it, a faithful customer.....So my lesson is now, Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson. McDonalds doesn't care about my patronizing their establishment and I'm going to seriously break my coffee habit. No more McDonalds from Oak Park on Madison for me.
A lesson well learned, can you believe my feeling was hurt when he said that my breakfast was to be discarded.",Negative
Ok long wait.,Negative

I went up and asked the woman (short reddish hair) who was calling out the order numbers if my number had been called. The answer was no. I kept waiting and still nothing. I asked her again but I was rudely ignored due to her having a chat with her friend. I asked several different people working there about my latte but they all said it's coming and moved on. The staff were either rude, indifferent and just no longer interested in me after I had paid. People came and went with their orders and I was left waiting for my one latte. I said to one woman how long does it take to make a latte? She looked at my ticket and of course no one had even started making it. I was disgusted with the truly terrible customer service.

"This is the worst McDonald's I've ever been to. I've tried it several times, mostly because it's on the way to my work...but after today, honestly, I'd rather skip breakfast all together. I got a completely soggy hash brown, soggy all the way around. I got a small caramel frappe with a shot of espresso. They put the espresso on the bottom and just poured the Frappe on top, so all I got was espresso when I first tried it. To add insult to injury, they put it in a small cup and dumped the rest out (it should have been in a medium cup). I worked at a McDonald's for over 2 years and this one does not follow procedures at all",Negative

Fraud location !! !!!Fraud location !!!, the manager told us they have different policy for this location they don't work any more with the corporate , I am really worried about What's This now , they said they only respect the online ordering coupons if ur ordering at drive thru ( in photo ) the manager given us , health department must check this location carefully bcoz something is fishy here .. or Macdonald corporate MUST HAVE A CHECK On them URGENTLY, avoid it",Negative
I can't even give them a star.  We had to order 4 times after sitting in line for over 45 mins- they still got it wrong.  Their team needs training severely.  We ended up working with the manager and he did give us the food free- spouse and teenage found it inedible.,Negative

The ice cream is fine... Not much else..,Negative
Unnecessary long wait time in drive thru. Drive thru is built for double cars and double pick up windows but still stayed behind 4 cars for 30 minutes. Only waited due to long drive home with kids in the car. Rude staff as well. Really wish I had noticed the Burger King across the street earlier. I would have even settled for checkers across the street and that's saying a lot because I don't think anyone willingly eats at checkers,Negative
Poor ,Negative
DO NOT GO!!!!!### the WORST customer service!!!! Manager does not do anything to solve a problem when drug addicts fight with customers!!!!!!! It's literally a McDonald's for the homeless.,Negative
"Horrible location. Frequently makes mistakes with larger orders. Almost every time we come here with larger orders there are missing items. Rude employee as well. One time refused to give me receipt at drive thru.
Was there yesterday also, and the employee at the drive thru window did not wear mask properly. Only half the mouth was covered and the nose was not covered at all. Note that this McDonald's is located in one of the NYC Covid hotspots.",Negative
"I ordered takeout from the McDonald's app. After waiting at least 20 minutes they finally talked to me and asked about my order. I said that I put my order in through the app. They said that because their system was down they could not give me the food that I paid for. I spent ten dollars and wasted a half hour of my life. I have had to complain to corporate, I have had to talk to a manager via email. Nothing has been done, they don't even want to give me a refund they merely offered me a coupon which they never gave me. It has been months since this had happened and there is still no resolution. If I left a McDonald's with ten dollars worth of food they would have me arrested but because I am a customer they are fine with stealing my money and my time. This is a terrible McDonald's and because of this experience I will no longer be going to any McDonald's in the future.",Negative
Hours are NOT accurate.,Negative
"It literally took my boyfriend an hour and 13 minutes to receive our food. (two meals)

The workers are really rude, don know how to work, take millions of year to prepare the food OR take your order and when you try to ask for basic things like drinks they treat you bad or ignore you.

I waited for this lady to take my money for 5 minutes and all she did was look at me and took the drive thru orders. So I just pulled up to the other window to pay and it took another 4-5 minutes to friggin pay. Never again going to ANY McDonald's, ever.",Negative

Worst macdonald  in the world. There are people asking for money in there which is very ,Negative
"Dirty, unkind, too long waiting time, too high work load with minimum of employees",Negative
"Tl;Dr poor service, frequently gets orders wrong.

We try and avoid this place even when we specifically have a hankering for McDonald's. We always have an issue at this McDonald's no matter what time of day,  whether we order from a food delivery service or in person. The orders always get screwed up,  from missing items to getting a sausage egg and cheese mcgriddle that just had cheese! If there was other fast food options besides pizza and halal nearby we'd probably never go here again.
But today I finally understood why it's a mess: there's no communication. It was a busy time since school had just let out and I stood for about 5 minutes waiting for a Dr. Pepper and watched the crew work in relative silence while pushing out food orders without tickets and without speaking to each other. Anyone who has worked in food service knows a quiet kitchen spells more trouble than a loud one. Eventually my sister flagged down the man doing drink orders and asked if the drink he'd just placed in the row of 8 other drinks he'd been setting down indiscriminately was our Dr. Pepper and he said yes...it was a Coke.
Management here really needs to have a talk to the crew about working together as a team and communication, especially when it's busy. Yes it's just a McDonald's, and I'm not expecting white glove service from a fast food joint, but our community deserves better than what we're getting for sure.",Negative
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. I get it only food but it fast food. We waited over thirty minutes for our food and should be called slow food. We waited at the drive thru first and no one was taking orders then we went inside and had to order on the kiosk because they told us too. Why h,Negative
Horrible The fries taste like ass,Negative
Service and costumer service awful horrible!!,Negative
"This is a below average McDonald's.  The self-ordering machines don't print receipts with your number so you better catch it on the screen because they may or may not see it on the system.  Fortunately, I was only getting some sodas and they didn't question my order but if it had been a real order it might not have gone smoothly.",Negative
Waited in drive thru for 20 minutes had to go in to get our order.manager was great but they had everyones order messed up.,Negative

Not clean place. Poor service.,Negative
"My only visit to this shop and I witnessed these: 1) There were two lines but suddenly one of the staff members stopped taking orders and closed the point-of-sales machine.  Those customers on that line were told to go at the back of the other line.
2) I understand that some staff are new but the supervisor or senior staff are rude to the new staff and do not help train them.  I don understand the yelling (probably because they are in Spanish).
3) Majority of staff speak Spanish and announce numbers in Spanish.  Expect some misunderstanding when they are taking your order too.  One of the staff put in hot coffee when I ordered hot coffee.
4) Be prepared to wait in a long line and always check your order before you leave the pick up counter.  It was my fault that I did not check/realize my Big Mac and South West salad dressing are missing when I felt.

TLDR?; just don쐬羲s will always be a bad decision anyway.",Negative
Really bad customer service. Not once but twice with two different employees. Asked for condiments and you would think they were doing me a favor.,Negative

This place has changed a lot.They forget about your order or forgets certain things in your order.Now there are more homeless's.Now there are teenagers working there and messing up your order.My grandma asked for a ice cream cone but they gave her a cup instead.I recommend going to a different McDonald's for right now until they fix the problems.,Negative
"Just went and got 4 McChicken, 1 Large French fry a medium one and a cheeseburger.

The entire order was old. French fries were saggy like and old lady titis. The McChicken tastes like they were cooked a month ago. Aaaah wait no coke because the machine was down. First is the shake machine and now the coke. Come on man. Worst MCDONALD Ever fuuuuck",Negative

Not only was it packed and slow moving but our mobile app that said ready in 3-5 minutes actually tool close to 15 minutes. A BIG thing was having to pay to have a refill on your drink. That is ridiculous.,Negative

Service declined....,Negative
The worst service ever... the people behind us got their orders but our order never been processed. We decided to cancel our order instead. The manager never apologized for that error.

They don,Positive
"Waited almost 30 minutes to get my food, while people with bigger orders that came after me, got their food. When asked what was taking so long, they said they are working on the order, then followed by asking me what my order was. After wards, had another employee who knew what was going on come out to ask me again what order was, had to stand there and watch them put my food into a microwave. The worst experience ever.",Negative

Not open 24 hours -_- they said they close from 2 am - 6 am even the drive-thru but they will serve people ordering on food delivery apps? Didn't make much sense to me when they are supposed to be open 24 hours and still make food for delivery orders,Negative

"I tried to use a coupon to get a free medium fries from the Mcdonald app along with my other items i purchased and after the scanned the coupon they gave me small fries.

"Drive through experience. Long line, no problem, tourist area. Took a while to take my order. When I paid, the person didn't even make eye contact, he gave me my receipt without saying a word except for the total and shut the window. Then, went to the 2nd window where the guy gave me the water bottle and sent me to the 3rd window. By the time I paid, at 10:02 pm, it was 10:20 pm and I was still waiting on anyone to come to the 3rd window. Then a female employee brought me a kid's meals and when I asked her for the rest of the order, she waved her hand and said ""I don't know"" with an attitude. She left and I waited 5 more mins before anyone came to the window. A male manager came and I explained what was missing plus to look at the happy meal that only had 4 fries, cold nuggets, no toy, no sauce, no napkins. When I showed the kid's meal, he said what happened to the fries? (as if we ate them). I looked at him and said ""that's what you guys gave me and to look at the camera"". He then said ""hold on"" and slammed the window. Another 5 mins go by, gave me the food and I asked where is the sauce and he said the 1st bag, but it wasn't there. As he was getting me the sauce, I told him this was the worst service ever and that I was going to put a review. He shrugged his shoulders, slammed the window and left. I then proceeded to hunk my horn very loudly to see if he came back to the window, but he never did.
I'm a store manager myself and I would never tolerate a behavior like that from any of my managers or from any of my team members. My 6 year old grand-daughter was in the car and was crying with this upsetting situation.

As a frequent customer of this McDonald I am furious that you have your workers working under a heat wave with no type of air conditioning. I walked in to order with my kids and had to take my order to the car and eat in car which was very uncomfortable with 4 kids bet way better than eating in a place where it was difficult to breath. If you treat your employees like this than this is the reason your customer service in this locate is poor. As a franchise you shouldn be involved in this type of business never the less in any type of customer service business. I will not be returning to this location as my money is worth more to other busine,Negative

"For one usually it's only for coffee and to get away from the office as I stopped eating McDonald's food. The problem I faced recently was a homeless person who walked up to me and asked for 2 dollars for bus fare. When the bus stop is like 2 to three blocks down the road. I said I will buy you something to eat or drink but not give money. So,  for folks or tourists who get folks coming to them asking for money I suggest trying to offer food to them is more important then money. One thing about DC is there is alot of resources for folks who need money for bus fare or anything can find. Food too they know where to go. It's up to them to make that move. Another major situation I noticed is the McDonald's need some updating. I might know why they keep it so dull looking because McDonald's operates with the homeless so I guess they don't want to make it too comfortable. I been to much better ones who got nice and cool lounge chairs couches and OMG this one just looks ragged.",Negative

"Bathroom it was a disgraceful experience. Lobby tables dirty. Drinking fountain super dirty. Hamburger box came oily. Unfortunately, it was NOT a great experience and cleaning McDonald's. Better to give up on McDonald's for once and for ALL. You can base a restaurant by their bathrooms.",Negative

Workers are loud in kitchen playing around...not professional. Not coming back here,Negative
Worst experience ever!!!  Didn't have anything on the menu. When we finally found something we could actually get it was cold. The buns had been toasted long before the burger was made. Not even warm enough to melt the cheese!!  Never again!!,Negative
"I've been there twice. My order was completely messed up both times. The first time they offered to make the missing burger and make fresh fries. I waited 20 min before I said, I want my food or my money now. I got my burger and the same fries she took from me 20 min ago. I watched them screw up order after order while spending time playing and flirting. Horrible place. Needs real management. Not management trying to get into their co workers pants.",Negative
"The App let's you order breakfast and pay ahead, but when you show up and it's 10:03, their system won't let them complete your order.

The location is relatively good, the employees are always friend and fast.

But someone needs to pass along yo the corporate office/app devs and need to either decide to

1) prepare prepaid breakfast orders and have them ready before the 10:00 shut off, or

2) allow them to prepare my prepaid breakfast order 3 minutes after ""it's no longer breakfast time""

I do not want to eat a burger as my first meal of the day at 10:03 on the way to work.",Negative
You would find the Covid-19 vaccine here before you found a working ice cream machine,Negative
All our burgers were not cooked!!!,Negative
Female cashier was rude and was very unprofessional. If you are a tourist and don't know when it is cash only you don't get a receipt do not yell at the customer like we supposed to know what is going on. The only good thing about going was lemuel he was a great help. I would not want the girl to serve us with that attitude.,Negative

But what was odd was that we got our cheesesteaks and waited an extra 30 minutes for our fries and milkshakes. That was weird and frustrating.",Negative
"My family and I came here and we were all disappointed. They were not welcoming and they had a line, didn even bother asking anyone what they needed. The people needed to stop the worker and ask for what they needed, no one was ever at the counter. We are Hispanic and we also felt discriminated against because the lady at the counter didn want to give us refills and didn",Negative
Terrible,Negative
Rude and unattentive staff.   They were not even busy and I asked can I order my food at the register basically was told you have to use the kiosk and she walked away from me.

I came in at 10:30 on a Sunday and no dam breakfast.really? The only thing I want at 10:30 in the morning on a Sunday is an egg mc muffin. They had no pancakes. I only drink coffee and have breakfast at McDonald's and they didn't have acceptable breakfast products.,Negative
Full of homeless people hanging out asking for money & if u tell them no some of them will attack u,Negative
"Don't waste your time at this McDonald's. You will be waiting for at least 30 minutes to get your food. Kiosk ordering is also messed up at this location, and doesn't work like it does at other locations.",Negative
This week I went twice for coffee I ask for it with cream and sugar and it came to work and the coffee without sugar what a courage,Negative
Order food here and wait 30 mins for your order.... no fast food here,Negative
"The drive thru is not open 24 hrs. Theres nothing worse than driving to a location advertising being open only to get there and see the cleaning person ignore you as you try to ask for the hours.

Seems to be a popular place for the homeless to visit.",Negative
"Fries under cooked
Chicken nuggets over cooked,  always messing up my order and this us 4th time ,never coming back just horrible service.",Negative
Just went through the drive thru and literally was in line for about 20 mins start to finish. For being a fast food they are super slow. They are in the heart of Orland and do not do a good job. My French fries were cold. One of my kids drink was empty and the cookies I ordered were completely wrong. I would suggest going to q near by restaurant which they have faster service than these people.,Negative
"The worst McDonald's in Miami, horrible waiting time, only one cook, bitter employees, a disaster with Uber Eats... you want to save yourself a hard time, don't come here!",Negative
I've visited this establishment on three differences occasions and they've all been the same experience.... RUDE and A TAD BIT RACIST. No More Business from me personally.,Negative

I did not get syrup with my breakfast, the sink did not work in the restroom, the security guard was cursing at the customers who are all homeless people, a lady hooked up speakers in the restroom.. I don't get it, I felt like I was in the twilight zone",Negative
They are very disorganized and having customers waiting on orders that they gave away to other people,Negative
"Terrible service. We bought a whole bunch of items and asked for an ice water.

They refused to SELL ice water to us.

I have never been to a McDonalds that REFUSES to SELL ice water. (It's usually free)

Also, the lady who took our order could barely understand English and had to ask another employee to translate for her. We ended up repeating our order three times.

This is probably the worst service I have ever had at McDonalds.",Negative
"I ordered 2 of thier ""premium"" chichen sandwiches,  TOTALLY GROSS,  AND SOGGY COLD DOES",Negative
Ordered quarter pounder on 2 different nights and both times burger was still raw in the middle. Totally unacceptable for place that sells food. Stay away unless you want E. Coli poisoning.,Negative
A much needed effort in prompt customer service and cleanliness.,Positive
"The worst drive thru service I've ever had anywhere. From the time I started paying attention to how long I was waiting in line til the time I was given my food was 48 mins. At least 10 mins before that I was waiting in line not paying attention to how long I'd been there.  So roughly an hour to get my food. Then only to be treated rudely  by the cashier, because somehow I was supposed to know they wanted cash only. Not sure why, since I had no choice but to run my debit card and it went through just fine and in a normal amount of time. I'll never go there again. I'll drive a few mins to another location.",Negative
What staff they had were working hard but the place was a mess in service was very slow.,Negative

I paid for my order... went to the second window.. was given a huge bag that almost broke through with stuff... I pulled up just a little bit to check my order:  noticed I was missing an item, fries, so I pulled around to let the lady at the first window know I퐉 missing something... she just dismissed me to the 2nd window... and the 2 ladies at the second window weren the best either.  When I stated I drove back around because I was missing my fries.. I didn realize my receipt was in the bag to confirm my order.. found it and gave it to one of the ladies... the second lady, I퐉 guessing to be heard due to my inconvenience of my order not being correct, for her to take ownership for what possibly could of went wrong and show some compassion instead of being kind of prude ... after I received the fries the manager dismissed me with a condescending ",Negative
Poor ,Negative

Felt like I was back in New York City.",Negative

I find it scary sometimes... They take forever with the orders.. Nearly 30 Min wait..,Negative

Placed a mobile order and it went through. I ordered large fries but then the manager refused to give me my order because their system was down. I showed her my order and she still refused. She said I should cancel it. When I asked how she said she didn't know how. Horrible service,Negative

"It took 1 plus hours to get thru the drive thru.  The drive thru is such that once in line you cannot get out. No one apologised for the abnormal wait time. When I got my food, the fries where cold and the taste old. I usually to not complain about a restaurant but 1 plus hours in a drive thru line is ludicrous. Especially for a fast food establishment.",Negative
They dont know respect no customer service,Negative
This is the worst McDonald's on the planet not one of the rude Cubans that work there don't deserve to make a hamburger.,Negative

No drive thru ?,Negative
"Food was the bog standard, biggest issues here are:
1. The cheeseburger I ordered had a hard bun.
2. Service was terribe there should be lines or devides to clearly mark queing lanes rather than someone shouting ""There are three lines"" and there be nobody serving in the other 2.
3. They messed up my order (seems to be the case in every McDonald's in NYC they seem to miss out 2 of the things on my order, that being fries or drink.)
Wouldn't recomend.",Negative
Can,Positive
I was eating here and the parking enforcement booted my car while I was eating. I produced a receipt but the man who booted my car accused me of leaving the premises so eating at this mcdonalds cost 75.00$. Dont ever go here!,Negative
The service was terrible. They got my order wrong twice and they didn't have me my fries with my food. And the first time they miss something in my order....,Negative
"The inside smells like baby diapers. When you ask for extra sweet and sour sauce they give you a dirty look like it is such a hassle. The ice cream machine is always broken, and the food always looks like it was put together so carelessly. Guess you can't expect much from a McDonald's anyways.",Negative
"Lobby still closed even though Whataburger and everyone else has opened up.  So, you get to spend 20 to 30 minutes waiting in the drive through line to place an order that half the time they screw up.  Happened again today.  A simple #1 meal with a coke.  Got only the Big Mac and nothing else.  Pointed it out to the lady and handed her the bag back.  She disappeared for few minutes and when she returned with my order, shoved it at me and rudely turned away like it was all my fault.  This is probably the worst run McDonald's in the area.   Don't recommend it at all.",Negative

"The service was slow, there were 4 people ahead if me and only 1 cashier.  Then it looks like the manager or supervisor opened up.  They didn't have Sprite, or Hi-C orange.  Some guy in a black tank top got up from the table and walked to the back where they were preparing food. Now I realized it was an employee, not in uniform.  Bathroom was out of order and every table that I went to was dirty.  It's been a while since I've eaten in there, it looks like new management??  I'm concerned.",Negative
"waited in the drive through for over half an hour, all i got for my trouble was a ""sorry for the wait"" not even an explanation. When I got to the second window there were at least a dozen sodas just sitting on the counter. It's not the first time I've had bad service. I once pulled up and they just said we're not serving right now even though it was smack dab in the middle of the day hours.",Negative
I have never seen such a slow mc donasl in my life.,Negative
"Too many homeless people sleeping at night. Near the restrooms & nobody is taking them out of the place. It supposed to say ""limit seating time 20 minutes"" & worst of all. Nobody is renovating the place with the red shingles & the Playplace too. Please do something about this!",Negative

Not the same as it use to be,Negative

Did fix the problem though i dont know what was said. ( i still only speak our official language) 36 minutes later out the door with an "" i appolagize""

"Waited in drive-thru for 30 mins, finally got up to order & nothing. We kept asking if anyone is there. Kid finally comes on that they had to reboot the system & could be another 15 mins at least. We told him he needs to tell people as there is a line around the building. Truly horrible service.",Negative
Place smells security staff is a joke,Negative
"Placed a mobile order for pickup. Waited 15 minutes for a single burger that never got called. All of that wouldn't be so bad but when I called for a refund I was lied to by the manager that they called my order, which they did not.

Bad,Negative
one of the worst McDonald's I have ever been to. bun was so stale I am surprised I didn't break a tooth.,Negative
This has to be the worst McDonalds! The food is never hot and never fresh.  I went there again tonight since it's the only place open.   The fries were warm and tasted like they had been cooked in an air frier and the burger was cold and tasted like it had been sitting for hours.   This places stays pretty busy so there is no excuse for poor quality of food imo.   Avoid unless it's your only option.,Negative
Food was bad. They barely put special sauce on Big Mac. I couldn't really taste the sauce at all.,Negative
Used to be a fun place to go to but everything has changed,Negative

rubbish service,Negative
If you want to watch employee's fight and spend a half a hour waiting on fries and a Frappe this is the McDonalds for you. Service between 5 - 6 am horrible and the 10pm line is backed up onto Ewing Ave. Very Childish and unpleasant employee's.,Negative
It has been 20+ min and im still sitting here as I am writing this waiting for my food. And the employees seem too busy to acknowledge your presence half the time when you are trying to speak to them.,Negative
They disregard promotion offers and very arrogance stuff and unfriendly boss. Very bad commercial for mcdonalds brands.,Negative
"We go here after almost every late night event we attend in Salt Lake City. Concerts, Jazz games, Utes games. Will probably find another place. The Fries have been way below the McDonald's standard for the last few times and this last time, they changed their ice cream completely. Now the vanilla cones and the hot fudge sundaes are made with that cheap ""ice cream"" that is a cross between a terrible sorbet and cheap refrozen ice milk. Truly disgusting. At least the Cokes were $1.00...but that won't bring us back.",Negative

Sending everyone to overflow and then 20 minutes later delivered all reheated food that looks prepared over an hour ago. Whoever the order taker at 1pm is is the rudest woman ever. Terrible McDonald's,Negative
Not good,Negative

I can't remember the time I got good fries from them.   Once in a while there are good employees there that make up for it but I have simply dropped this place from my list of places to go after the last few times I've eaten there.  I should say this is for all McDonald's,Negative
"I needed a pick me up and stoped by for some iced coffee. Since I am diabetic , i can only have regular  cold coffee with milk , no flavored milk . Still i had to pay full price for a med cold coffee  (with only 3 ice cubes I wished for ) came out for almost 2 $ ! I think this is pretty unfair , overpriced and pure profit ! So I am not ever going to buy anything from Mc.Donald anymore .",Negative
It's called fast food for a reason and there is nothing fast about McDonald's in key west. The staff is rude and there hasn't been one time they have gotten my order correct.,Negative
"I found a hair in my fries, and when I brought it to the staff's attention, they were unapologetic and didn't offer any compensation.",Negative
I don't know where to start. OMG! This is the slowest MCDs restaurant in the world. Staff act like if they were on vacation. You can see in their faces that they hate working here and are just looking forward to the end of their shift. Manager came out after a while and there was no improvement in performance. The automated order system was not working so I waited in line for 10 mins. just to order and pay. From this point it was exactly 27 mins. until my order was ready. All that was was a bottle of water and a mocha coffee. And I had to ask them otherwise it would have been more than half hour. I reckon staff must really ask themselves whether they want to work here. There may be other better places where they could find job satisfaction. Here they're just turning a bunch of people into unhappy customers.,Negative

"For workers like her big companies' name are ashamed.

What a horrific experience I just had;  this lady you see in the picture for telling her she was giving me a wrong item and not the one I paid for she started a big drama and spilt my son's smoothie and started singing a vulgar song/lyrics as per offending me through that and not directly addressed to me. All that in front of the manager ..

Besides that waiting time was ridiculous long with a lot of customers not satisfied and even a uber eats guy had to cancel in front of  me because they didn't make his order in more than 20 min that I was there ...

Another lady in the back was not using the yellow paper that sandwiches have she was placing the  buns/bread directly on the table as she was preparing food for dogs. She saw me and start acting like nothing happened..

Good ,Positive
McDonalds is my go to fast food restaurant. It has been the only place since my son was a baby that we have been able to go to get a quick bite to eat due to his severe dairy allergy. Yes they have a dairy free meal for him and for me a gluten free meal. A match you can't beat. I won't say how old my son is but McDonalds has been ahead of their time for over two decades now when it comes to having special meals. It's been a great place for our family to go.,Positive

The manager at this store is absolutely outstanding . They just reintroduced the steak bagel and I said what can I change the bread to a McGriddle and she did that without a single question. I even went as far as to ask her if I have the round egg instead of the folded and she jumped right to it and that was fantastic. Try it sometime it's wonderful thank you very much and God bless.,Positive

Glad I walked in. The drive-thru line was ginormous. (TWO lines!) Ordering inside was pretty easy - a couple order kiosks or a plexi-barrier'ed pair of cash registers. Time spent waiting was a lot less than if waiting in the drive thru lanes(s). Clean tables and floor - actually being mopped while I was there.,Negative

"This is a 24/7 location, which is great. The receipt printer was broken for a while which was annoying because they would still read off the order numbers as a method of calling people. Also, the layout is a bit odd. It narrows significantly in the middle of the store, making it hard to get through to the doors and the counter at busier times.",Negative

It's a little bit hard to get in and out of the parking lot other than that everybody is very nice and it's a good facility they don't run as many specials or deals like by two or buy one get one free on the breakfast sandwiches and stuff like a lot of other McDonald's do so that's why I didn't give him five stars other than that the place is clean and they're good,Positive
"I don't love it. It's an unfortunate weakness in my DNA that I can't be hungry. I was a hungry child and find myself eating fatty foods just to feel full longer. I know it's bad. It's only a convenience to go to McDonald's and it's cheap. I will try harder to be organic. It's what I dream of. Gold? No. I'm more of a silver lady. Arches? Again, No. Absolutely nothing memorable about MO. (Misery)",Negative

"Very average McDonald's experience overall. Was cool because of the whole ""largest McDonald's"" bit, but it was extremely hectic inside with kids running and screaming everywhere. Took a while to even get the opportunity to order, then food took a while to get to us, which is understandable since it was so busy. Ice was out in 3/4 soda machines. Not a very clean place either. Pizza was alright. Very dry, flavorless crust, pretty soggy and could have used more time in the oven/ the oven could be hotter. If they put like 20% more effort into the flavor of the pizza it would be a lot better. Onion ""slivers"" were also just onion chunks. Not a big deal, just a little misleading. But what else you expect from a McDonalds. Food is a little pricier than the McDonald's I'm used to as well. Would probably have a better experience making the effort to dine elsewhere.",Negative
"This mcdonalds is good, correct order. Good quality",Positive
Convince,Positive

Good fast location. They had a third window for you to pull forward to keep the line moving through the drive thru instead of having someone walk out to your car. It was super convenient and it did seem to save time. We will probably stop by this location again before our trip it over. You can't really go wrong with $1 cheeseburgers.,Positive

It can get tight getting inside when there's a delivery truck next to the store. Most especially when you're going towards the drive-thru 占쏙,Negative
Live nearby and this is our choice McDonald's compared to others in close distance. I gotta say though that the last order of fries I got really were so yucky I chewed on 2 and didnt eat the rest. They tasted over cooked or double cooked. Something made them rubbery and inedible to me.,Negative

"Got two Filet-O-Fish sandwiches.  Both were good as expected.  I ordered through the McDonald's app and opted to pickup my sandwiches at the drive thru.  I told the employee at the speaker that I had an app order to pickup and gave her the code.  She instructed me to go to the first window.  There I was given the receipt, thanked, and told to go to the next window.  At the 2nd window I was told to go to a 3rd window to pickup the order.  The 3rd window is kind of funny, since it seems like an afterthought.  Since it is at the corner of the building close to a sign, it is difficult to get close enough to be handed the order without scraping the side of your car. Then to leave you have to turn your wheels hard right.  The employees were very friendly.",Positive

"This location is huge for a McDonald's. It has play area and arcade games. It also offers customize pizza and pasta menu, in addition to the usual offering. Prices are slightly more compared to other locations, which is justifiable given the amenities it offers. I saw some reviews complained about slow or bad service. I didn't notice that on my visit.  Overall, I think it worths a visit if u happen to be in the area.",Negative

"I Honestly can not believe that I am going to give the McDonald's in Brodheadsville five/5 STARS!!!!
They deserve it they have proven it to us over and over again..  The New Manager (wish I knew her name) has taken this location from a zero/0 stars to getting a rating of Five/5 Stars and I know that it could not have been easy. I have picked up dinner her once a week for 8-9 weeks in a row and the FOOD has been great.  Thats a lot considering its a McDonald's. My food when I picked it up was always hot, all the food was there correctly. Everything was well made and put together.  You can tell the new manager has set the standards extremely high at this location and the employees have responded extremely well for her. She deserves a big hand for caring about her staff and customers.
Thank You for Caring.......
Great job!!   Well done!!!!!",Positive

Normally I would give this restaurant five stars but today service was really slow. I placed an order for two Egg McMuffins & a large french vanilla coffee. My wait time was approximately 10 minutes. I also believe on this particular day the restaurant was understaffed. Again usually this restaurant is a five-star McDonald's just not on this day.,Negative

"The only reason I am giving this location for stars instead of 5 is because overall, I don't eat McDonald's or fast food. However, the one day that I did go to Santa Monica, I just had a sudden craving for something fatty and sugary.

I went inside and dislocation surprisingly very clean. The staff there were also very hospitable, friendly, and alert. I ordered me some french fries and a sweet iced tea, and then I proceeded to the outdoor Courtyard to eat.

Out there was just as clean as it was on the inside. I haven't had McDonald's since 2012, so I was really surprised at how fresh the french fries and the sweet iced tea taste it.

Everything was okay okay with me.",Positive

The only reason for the four out of five stars is because their projection screen/interactive play mat has not worked properly since we have been visiting there over the last year. It has partially worked on a couple of occasions and my granddaughter remembers that she enjoyed it. Every time we퐎e there she stomps on it to try to make it work.

"They literally almost got the entire order wrong, would not come back ever. My family got two deluxe s round egg, 1small decaf coffee, 2 med coffees with sugar and cream. We ended up with packets of ketchup, no bread for the muffins in the deluxes,no hashbrowns and the wrong amount of cream.

Ok sorry I actually came back the other day and the food was amazing this time. Also, there is another McDonald's in my area that's pretty lame. This place has a better service overall.(sort of long review sorry)",Negative

"Ordered two plain fish sandwiches with no cheese or  tartar sauce, due to a dairy allergy. When I got to the pick up window - they had put slices of cheese in both sandwiches. I returned them and had to sit and wait for the order to be corrected.  Unfortunately, this happens constantly, no matter what McDonald's I go too. It's clear the prep team simply isn't paying attention to the instructions on the orders.",Negative

I like coming to this location the morning team is always kind & friendly...the night team has more younger team members some of them have great customer service..but the only thing that stopped me from rating 5 stars the point system I've had trouble several times adding my code to gain point for my purchase ...and reached out to McDonald's customer service and was told someone would contact me but that hasn't happened ,Negative

There aren't too many good McDonald's you can find a good plug in for your laptop but this one is awesome.

The staff is good and very helpful every time I go there. One day I was low on money but really had to eat. One of the guys who worked there gave me a break and upsized my drink as a courtesy. It was hot as $h&t outside and I had a longer lasting drink to curve the heat.",Positive
The Big-Mac is better than ever.  And the Junior Mac is great. You gotta love it.  Food is consistent at the 90th South location.,Positive

"World largest McDonald's. Food is the same, they have pizza and pasta too. The seating and ordering process was quick and easy, but actually getting the food on time together was a challenge.

Our burgers came in fairly fast 10 minutes or so, but pizza took 30 minutes+ from the time when we ordered it. I had to come down and ask for my order for them to give me the pizza.

Honestly, this worth a single visit, especially the playground if you have kids. If you looking for a quick bite, I would go to the other locations with less people and quicker service.",Positive

They just kept taking people from the other line. I know that sometimes happens,  they forget the order cars pull up. But not 4 in a row. As they started taking the 5th car,  I pulled into the line and went to the window.  Food was OK when I got it.  But waiting 30 minutes for that to happen in the drive through isn't cool.",Negative

Best fries I have had in a while. Also got a cheeseburger and I must admit I was also pleased as I hate it when I decide to actually eat 1,000 calories and my cheese is thrown in my hamburger and not even melted yucky.

Today we were there around 7pm and the cashier and the manager were so nice to us and they even talked to my kids and made sure that we got everything we asked for. The only thing I didn't like was that for the happy meals for my kids they got the same toy and it was a girl toy, I have a girl and a boy so my son got a girl toy. I know why McDonald's do this but it's not the employees fault.",Negative

The food was typical McDs, but every staff member was just so friendly and helpful.  Granted I dont eat at inside McDs often, but I have never been so delighted and cared for ar one.  Greeted as I walked in, ordered from kiosks, food delivered to me, staff member checked on how my food was and wished well by members as I left.  McDs needs to bottle up the service from this location and send to all.  Cheers.",Positive

"Updated review 2022: This really is a great McDonald's. Maybe if you don't appreciate it, you haven't been around. The grounds are clean, I saw the manager (Chris) picking up trash around the store. They wear nice uniforms and there was an employee cleaning tables as soon as they were vacant. A very nice lady on morning shift was bringing orders TO THE TABLE ya'll. It was much busier at night so a longer wait but considering there are dozens of hotels nearby, I think service is pretty fast. (2019 Review) I went here three times during my stay in the area and the food was always hot, place clean and staff prompt and courteous. Got a fabulous greeting Memorial Day morning.",Positive
"Had a pleasant trip here with my 5 year old. On vacation from Indiana and compared to any McDonald's there this is like a fine dining restaurant lol clean, food was fresh, tomatoes where not mushy which brings me to believe they actually don't freeze there's like back at home. Had two managers walking around the restaurant actually working instead of being in the backroom 'doing paperwork' five stars definitely will be returning before we go back home.",Positive

I like coming to this location the morning team is always kind & friendly...the night team has more younger team members some of them have great customer service..but the only thing that stopped me from rating 5 stars the point system I've had trouble several times adding my code to gain point for my purchase ...and reached out to McDonald's customer service and was told someone would contact me but that hasn't happened ,Negative
Went at a good time of day so service was prompt.,Positive

"Awesome McDonalds with a huge dining and play area along with a full arcade. They offer both make your own pizza and pasta which is a unique and fun experience to create via the kiosks. All the food was good and was delivered directly to our table. The staff was pleasant and helpful. Definitely check out the USA's largest McDonalds if you can, you won't regret it!",Positive
"EDIT: Recently this McDonald's had been improving a lot, especial when compared to other McDonald's in the area (maybe the one on North part of W. Parmer, but not really fair comparison, I mean That one has a god-damn waterfall....). Keep up the good work! +1 Star

OLD: They took out all the power outlets and a table was just left broken covered with caution tape. Always understaffed and you can tell the owners are sucking this place for every penny without putting anything back in. Gives family owned McDonald's a bad name.",Negative
"Had to wait for RESTROOMS. When I got in the men's room was clean, well stocked with soap and TP. The rest of the restaurant was clean and the staff was good to me.",Positive
"Excellent and fresh, hot, food.  The inside is spacious and clean. Friendly staff but I don't like the system where you have to order by yourself with the large touch pad, makes it hard to customize your order and confusing.  I'd rather just wait in line and have the attendants take my order like most McDonald's.  But at this McDonald's you must order at the touch pad by yourself.",Positive
Loved everything from the service to the food. Between the promotions and coupons I save money. The loyalty points build up then I can get a free item. Today O had a large mocha frappe. Yum,Positive

I like McDonald's McChicken sandwiches and their Sundaes its delicious! I also like the way how they packaged their food Delivery its sealed with a security tape both drinks and food inside a secured paper bag with handles !! Best Fast food well safely secured in these challenging times when Coronavirus is ravaging our population and its health !! All fast food chains should follow McDonald's safety packaging procedures for food packaging deliveries !!,Positive

This is a pretty automated McDonald. Probably one of the most automated ones I퐒e come across. Many of the customers went strait to the devices shown to enter their order and just stood near the pick up counter for their order. I felt the process was still a bit slow given that the emphasis is for automation though. Plus the area to stand was congested since it,Negative

"From a quick visit about 4 months ago:

Dining room was small, seemed clean (my order was to-go so didn't spend much time inside).

Loved the digital menu/self-order kiosks (ordered at the kiosk and it still gave the option to pay cash at the register, though not sure if that option's still available and/or if the dining room's even open right now...?).

Staff was friendly enough and very helpful, packed my to-go order like absolute pros.

The area where the fountain drinks, straws, etc., are wasn't super tidy (a bit of a spill on the countertop, if memory serves); however, seemed clean, otherwise.

Because it was such a quick trip, didn't get to see the condition of the bathrooms (a good indicator of an establishment's working and overall conditions, in my experience). Maybe another time?

Overall, a good experience.

Something to consider: there's no drive-through nor a parking lot and finding a parking space seems to be a nightmare/hit-or-miss in that area. Circled the surrounding blocks a few times before someone parked almost right in front of the store just happened to be leaving (not sure how often that happens, though). Score!

The previous parking spot I'd found was about 2 blocks away (doable), but kept searching in order to be closer to the other establishment my group and I were visiting prior to McD's.",Negative

What those nice people don't know is I'm diabetic and my blood sugar was crashing cuz my car suddenly broke down a block away. Just when the cashier told us of the kindness, the tow guy called... he was one hour early! I didn't even see what type of car the kind people drove or get to wave thanks. I must add that my fish sandwich came with the extra sauce and the French fries were piping hot. Perfect ice in the drink and the right mix, too. They even gave us extra napkins!
