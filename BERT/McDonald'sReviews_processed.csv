"Why does it look like someone spit on my food?
I had a normal transaction,  everyone was chill and polite, but now i dont want to eat this. Im trying not to think about what this milky white/clear substance is all over my food, i d*** sure am not coming back.",0
"Made a mobile order got to the speaker and checked it in.
Line was not moving so I had to leave otherwise I폻 be late for work.
Never got the refund in the app.
I called them and they said I could only get my money back in person because it was stuck in the system.
Went there in person the next day  and the manager told me she wasn",0
"I repeat my order 3 times in the drive thru, and she still manage to mess it up , it was suppose to be a large meal double filet of fish with large fries , no cheese . It was all wrong , they either need to pay close attention to the order being made , understand English or they need not to work at a drive thru",0
I work for door dash and they locked us all out to wait in a long line for no reason at 10. I tried to beg them to open it because I'm door dash and they refused.  Covid is over get a new job,0
"If I  could give this location a zero on customer service, I  would. Pulled into drive through at 8:07 and placed a simple order. I order a regular hamburg and cookies. Once I paid and pulled up to the window to pick up, I  was told to pull up to the #1 space. I sat there and sat there and.........25 minutes later, no order. I  went in and no one was at the counter. I yelled ""hello"" three times. A young lady came up asking who was handling the front counter. A young girl appeared. To make this complaint shorter, I  showed my receipt and another 5 minutes later I got my order. There was another order with a drink sitting on the counter that never got to the person who ordered it. After getting home, I  had no regular hamburg but had cookies. Everyone, don't even bother going to this location again. It's a horrible experience every time as you can see by other reviews.",0
Worst McDonald,0
"We stopped by for a quick breakfast.  It was not crowded inside, but there was a pretty long drive thru.

Our order was supposed to have 3 food items and 2 drinks. They missed a food item. The lady ignored me when I told her.

My husband went to get it, she finished her task then handed it to him without a word or smile or anything.",0
"The morning crew seems fast and efficient. Night crew is a whole different experience, lines down the street, hour long waits. If this was a one time occurrence it wouldn't be so bad but this is a nightly problem. Beyond this the staff is so highly rude you leave wanting to crash your car through the building. Don't forget they will mistake your order almost every single time as well and serve it to you cold.",0
"Ordered food burger wrong and left out part of the order also. One of the drink cup lid not fattened. Poor service girl handing order at window on January 7, 2023 at 1pm.",0
This was a dine in experience. The tables were all dirty & we did not get our food after waiting 35 minutes. Chicken sandwich was burnt.,0
The boy who attended me made me wait and when he saw that the drink was wrong he threw the bag of food at me with a grimace. So disappointed!,0
"Can't believe experience with order taker. Went from drive thru and employee directly asks what do you want. He keeps rushing while taking order with no other cars placing order. We wanted to add one more item and asked for a minute. He keeps asking what else. When I said we are ready - no response. There were no other car placing order that time either. I told again we are ready. responded after a pause. Again what do you want... excuse me.. who talks to customers like this ??
I asked for his name to put a review and he flat out denied. I asked for receipt before handing my credit card. He swipes it and returns back my card. I m waiting for a receipt with my family in the car. He starts inputing another order on his tablet. Waited for sometime and then I waive my hand several times. He opens window and said you can get receipt from next window. Excuse me ??
Went to next window - picked up food, asked for Manager and got his name JAMAR. My receipt states 08/06/2022 7:20pm Order 05
I didn't want to complain but this was intolerable.",0
"Meh.. just meh. When I finally get the correct order, it is generally tasty. I'm a picky eater, and have found ways to navigate the menu to get items I like. Worked in the service industry for years as a server, bartender, and trainer. Taking and fulfilling orders is NOT hard, tedious at times though. I only go here when I see they are not busy, in hope that my order is correct when I go to leave. In the 10 times that I have been here in the past past year, I have only had 1 order that was perfectly correct. Just ONE, not an exaggeration. That one order was just 2 large fries and nothing else. Though I will mention that when I got home and pulled them out of the bag, they were hardly what you'd call filled, (nor did I enjoy any on the 3 minute drive home) so little so that I even sent a picture and post to McDonald's on Facebook, at least the few were hot. The evening staff is very pleasant, but the morning staff leaves a lot to be desired, as well as thinking that they can talk negatively about people in Spanish out in the open which, being a light skinned Puerto Rican, I understand perfectly. I have submitted several complaints and NEVER received a call or email back. I just don't go here anymore to avoid the stress of paying money for something that is most likely wrong.",0
Just needed caffeine. The staff at the drive thru just shoved the drink in my hands. Not very professional.,0
"This is consistently the worst meal you will pay for. Microwaved nuggets, cold fries and a 30 minute wait. What more can you ask for? Dont go here ever! Your better off going hungry or giving the meal you payed for to the homeless by the donation box behind the drive thru.",0
McDonald is proud to own the most broken ice cream machines on the planet. When I asked at the drive through if they had ice cream the lady replied a,0
Yet another McDonald's with horrible service and lazy employees. I mean c'mon do they intentionally hire unqualified people???,0
"This location is wack.
They will literally stop taking orders and make people sit in the parking lot for like 12 minutes until 3:00 a.m. so that they don't get to order dinner food anymore.
We have gone multiple times right after leaving the pinballz arcade just to sit in the parking lot in the Drive-Thru line waiting while they do nothing but wait for the order menu to change over.
Look McDonald's if I wanted a breakfast deluxe I wouldn't have shown up at 2:30 in the morning thank you.",0
They did not honor there advertised price. This is extra pickles.,0
"Just spent 10 minutes waiting at this McDonald's . According to Google they're open 24/7. Finally we pull up to the window to see if anyone was there, sure enough one employee seated in the lobby and another at the window. She told me they were closed. Whoever these two are they need to be replaced. Get it together McDonald's. You're a corporate power house and you have a reputation to keep. One of the most unprofessional experiences I've ever had with fast food. 0/10 would not recomend this location.",0
We hit it off pretty good in the beginning everything was great but that didn last long. I mean the service is fast but with attitude an,0
"This location is a horrible store to work for. The General Manger Omar Delgado  doesn know how to run a store efficiently. The Supervisor, Eduardo doesn care how it ran either.  As someone who used to work here at the Manger ",0
This is 3rd time I got this ,0
"Went through the drive through ordered a large fry and two chicken deluxe sandwiches
Got to the pay window and the read it back as two spicey chicken sandwiches
I restated that I wanted the deluxe crispy chicken sandwich
They said they would fix it after having to pay a second time for the lettuce and tomato?then when I got the order it was still a spicey chicken sandwich INSIDE a deluxe crispy chicken b",0
If you didn take 15 minutes to take a few orders I폻 be able to order off your normal menu instead of the disgusting br,0
"This is the WORST McDonald's EVER, I don't come here often because when I do my order is wrong EVERY TIME.  Today 2/25/22 1130am 1 the drive thru person could barely hear me and I was almost yelling 2 I get to the next window after paying and I'm asked what did you order?? I tell them at the end of me repeating my order I now have your entire staff looking CONFUSED AS HELL like I just dropped outta the sky now I'm being asked did I pay? Are you sure you ordered at the speaker? Now all of ya'll wear head sets except for the cooks the worst leadership I've ever seen",0
The drinks were watered down and the employee was downright rude when asked to replace the drinks.!!,0
"I ordered a Large fry buy after arriving to my destination I saw they did not fill the carton up.  They gave me a small portion for what I paid for.  This is not right and management needs to correct this.  Stealing from customers is plain wrong.  When ordering a large, they expect to get what should come in a large.  I noticed after my bad experience that your reviews are low.  In order order to create a good business, giving people an exceptional experience should be your goal not the opposite.",0
Will not answer my call. Messed up my order 4times in and hour!,0
Slow always have wait for my food and have to go back in to get it fixed.  No one ever iles or has a none fake smile. No welcome to McDonald's or have a great day especially in drive through . And if you do say something's wrong you get a major attitude especially from the shift manager guy tall black guy .  ( Sorry don't know his name ),0
Horrible service worker with a stank attitude for no reason working at the window mute with an attitude mad because she is miserable at work . They mess up the order and then don answer the phone it ridiculous. Found a long hair in my daughters happy meal fries and then the extra fry was missing from her meal and t,0
"Normally this location does pretty good, but last night was absolutely ridiculous. I sat in the drive thru for almost an hour waiting to get my order taken, the line was wrapped almost TWICE around the building, and finally I gave up and tried driving up to the window to give them my order since i was next in line. When i got to the window, they told me they couldn't take it and I'd have to go back around. I told them I'd like to put in my order here since I've been waiting all this time, and they proceeded to still refuse and that it's my fault for waiting in the second lane that they claimed was closed and had a sign out. The second lane was open, and the ""sign"" they were talking about was a wet floor sign they had placed right next to the drive-thru menu. I told them the lane looked open from our side and they still proceeded to argue with me, and then slammed the drive thru window shut. I've never received such deplorable customer service in my life, and if any managers are reading this, I highly suggest firing the two workers from last night.",0
I went to this location tonight to see if they could give me the Oreo Mcflurry that a different McDonald had forgotten earlier they completely refused. Unbelievable.. It ice cream,0
"Rude customer service, unprofessional attitude, overcooked food, no complimentary items for screwing up our orders. I don't understand how you can keep your job when there is so many negative reviews. I vow to never eat here again. I would rather eat a cold can of baked beans...",0
"Representative was very rude and disrespectful,  refused fulfilling my order and simply hung up on me on the drive through window... never was I so disappointed at that location before. Manager pretended like nothing even happened.",0
I went to pick up food from the restaurant at late night through drive through. I was told to wait near the door and I will be getting the order but even after waiting 15 minutes no one came with the food. Orders are already assigned and even after coming through drive through it takes more than half an hour to get it which is not good. Lots of people behind me got the food but no one cared about the driver who is already waiting from long time. Thank you,0
"The manager IS RUDE at 13749 183 research Blvd.in north Austin TX. HAD TO GO BACK INTO THE  DINER  3 TIMES AND THE 3RD TIME THE MANAGER DIDNT EVEN ACKOWLEDGE WE WERE EVEN THERE.. DISCRIPTION OF SAID MANAGER SPANISH ABOUT 5 FT TALL AND HAD LONG BLONDOISH HAIR PULLED BACK INTO A PONY TAIL. READ PREVIOUS REVIEWS AND THRY WERE NOT GOOD
NEED TO CHECK OUT WHAT IS GOING ON .",0
Never would come back here again my mother was asking for a coke and the lady became rude and said to her coworker in Spanish omg this fat women it hurt me that she said that and we know what she said so teach your employees how to speck properly in front of people,0
"I placed an order... the young lady at the drive thru kept having issues getting the order correctly... I paid for my order... went to the second window.. was given a huge bag that almost broke through with stuff... I pulled up just a little bit to check my order:  noticed I was missing an item, fries, so I pulled around to let the lady at the first window know I퐉 missing something... she just dismissed me to the 2nd window... and the 2 ladies at the second window weren the best either.  When I stated I drove back around because I was missing my fries.. I didn realize my receipt was in the bag to confirm my order.. found it and gave it to one of the ladies... the second lady, I퐉 guessing to be heard due to my inconvenience of my order not being correct, for her to take ownership for what possibly could of went wrong and show some compassion instead of being kind of prude ... after I received the fries the manager dismissed me with a condescending ",0
They get an extra Star because their staff 8 of 10 have been polite. Drive through has issues. They constantly get order wrong. Ask you to pull forward to fix and leave you hanging. I have had to go in twice to see why I am still sitting after five minutes. They are new. I understand training new people. But when you place an order and they repeat it back correctly and it comes out wrong or you have to repeat 3 times to make sure they get it right. Someone inside needs to make sure they are reading the whole ticket. Not just a quarter pounder. Especially with the multi menu choice of adding bacon or lettuce and tomatoes. Their tea as of late has tasted like dish soap and their fountain drinks have a funky taste to them. Numerous times their fries have been under cooked.,0
"McDonald's is usually pretty bad about inventory shorts especially.
The BBQ sauce, it's just a conspiracy but if you ever been a lover of Mcys Nuggets then you know they tend to ""Forget"" the BBQ sauce. Any other sauce and it's in there. But overall I dont see my self going back anytime soon.",0
"So Uber eats was having connectivity issues and pushed an order through to this location that was supposed to be cancelled. I know this isnt McDonald's fault, but when I called McDonalds to try and address the issue, they answered and then ignored me and must have left their phone off the hook because any attempt to call them after this got me only dial tone. I know places are short staffed, but you cant just ignore people.",0
"If I paid for a large-sized meal, and I asked for both a large fry and a large drink, please don't argue with me that the ticket says medium drink. Thank you so much from a single parent who just wanted to spend a little bit of money on unhealthy food for wasting my hard-earned money.",0
Customer  service  is no good the staff  play games  as if I'm there to pay my money  to see them horsing around. And the the management  are a jock don't answer  the phone . to night is September 29 2021 at 10:30pm my next  visit to Austin will not be to a McDonald's...,0
"waited in the drive through for over half an hour, all i got for my trouble was a ""sorry for the wait"" not even an explanation. When I got to the second window there were at least a dozen sodas just sitting on the counter. It's not the first time I've had bad service. I once pulled up and they just said we're not serving right now even though it was smack dab in the middle of the day hours.",0
"When you specifically say, 퐌lain AND dry?and then just to make sure they understood (cuz let face it, it MacDonalds) you add - o nothing but the meat and buns? Then you get home, open the bag, and immediately see the cheese through the hamburger wrapper.... I mean for cryin",0
"Buyer beware. Yeah it fast food and cheap. However, if you love to be consistently let down, this particular location is the place to frequent. This location loves to give you incorrect items and 100% of the time your order will be missing something.

Please be sure to check your order prior to leaving the premises. Do note that it takes forever to get them to correct their mistakes, so do take into consideration that the rest of your food will be cold and soggy by the time",0
2:42 AM on a Saturday and they just straight up stopped answering the drive through. They just sitting in there chilling,0
"Awful experience. Drive thru attendants are rude, untrained, and unprofessional. When asked for a manager the attendants lie and say that there isn't one on duty, FYI impossible for every shift not to have a manager. One specific attendant screamed and cursed at me, to which led me to contact corporate.",0
I ordered 4 happy meals with plain cheeseburgers. All the burgers were wrong. Do you know what it like to have four grandkids that can,0
McDonalds is NOT a fast food company anymore. They're just a food company now. Always a line wrapped around the building that never moves. When are robots going to replace the kitchen staff who hate their jobs?,0
This McDonalds CONSTANTLY gets orders wrong. We have ordered at the window and over uber and EVERY SINGLE TIME we dont get a complete order. Today we went back to get our fry we had 3 chicken sandwiches and 2 fry not complicated at all. The manager gave us a new one but the girl at the oick up window shoved the bag in ny hands and when I tha ked her she made a rude face and turned away.,0
"Night time drive through team seem really unprofessional. I ordered a meal with an extra fry, but when I got to the food window, was only given the fry with the meal. I mentioned the extra fry and was told I only paid for 1 fry. I offered to pay the difference for the extra fry, but was told I needed to drive back around and order again. Seriously? That's the response? Will not be returning.",0
"This is the 3rd time in a row that we퐒e been burned going through the drive threw. Each time they have messed up our order and you폻 think by now that I would have learned my lesson, but I thought this would be quick and easy. NOPE! This location sucks. I tried calling the number in the receipt but no one answers. I know I can",0
"Worst experience! All I asked for was a regular size coffee.I get to the window and was handed a small , I asked the woman if that was a regular to which she rudely said yes I questioned her again two more times then I asked her how many sizes of coffee they had she said small medium and large I asked her which one was the one I was holding and she said it's a small that's what we charged you for she said, and I told her I asked for a regular which would be a medium but I just drove off. Also asked for 3 splendas and 4 creamers on the side and received 3 regular sugars and 2 creamers. To top it off, coffee was full of coffee grounds to the point I was spitting them out. And as a little plus there was a piece of plastic! Never again!",0
"Attempted to go through the drive thru at 430 am. It said it was 24 hour, however no one seemed to be taking orders and I drove around twice just in case and tried again but still no answer. I saw one employee in the kitchen but couldn't get his attention.   Very bad business. If closed or delayed in opening then at least a sign that indicates that would have been nice.",0
"My burger was completely raw in the middle and when I took the burger back in to get it remade the lady behind the counter treated me like I was some stuck up brat for not wanting to eat a raw burger.
If I had the ability to give them a zero star rating I would. I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN!!!",0
"If I could give negative stars I would. This location is the absolute worst ever.  Every single time I go they f up my order! Then give attitude when they need to correct their mistakes.  I Try to give the benefit of the doubt everyone has off/bad days so I return thinking this time will be different, but it never is. They always suck. The staff is horrible. Corporate needs to send all their staff over to a week of training at chic-fil-A college to learn about work ethic, time management ,teamwork and basic manors.
I am baffled how chic-fil-a can have 30 cars in drive thru and get my order right the first time and under 5 mins. But at McDonald there could be 3 cars and it still takes 30 mins and 3+ tries to get my order right! makes no logical sense.
Moral of rant save your time and money and drive around the corner to chic-fil-a they got your",0
"When ordering food the employees conveniently forgot to turn off their microphones and were talking mess about all the food we had ordered, this is very unprofessional and honestly uncalled for.

"I don usually review places but this location has ridiculously rude service and consistently gets the orders wrong. Even when not busy. If I were rude, I",0
"Horrible customer service always gets my order wrong. They were out of French fries so I said that's fine I can wait while you make more. ""We can't do that"" seriously what kind of fast food place can't make fries? It only takes two minutes and 15 to heat up even the worst fryer. Which I would have waited for. Is this not the money making industry?

My business is now sitting at Whataburger who also doesn't have fries ready but said I could have some fresh in two minutes.",0
The most horrible service yet.  Drive thru can't get a dam thing right at all has no interest in his voice. I have to continue to repeat myself for you to still get it wrong. Then when I went through drive threw they still can't follow directions. So sad.,0
"I hate the new self ordering touchscreens. It can be hard to order even the simplest items.  Staff seemed preoccupied, did not even get my order correct. I had to ask for my parfait. Sweet tea was empty.",0
"Nothing! Staff was rude. No napkins out, tables were dirty. My son and I went in at 1050 to get lunch before a movie knowing lunch starts at 1030. They apparently don't serve lunch until 11. When I asked why she said because people like late breakfast on weekends. Why that affects lunch I don't know. According to the sign, breakfast is served all day. Had I read the reviews first I would have gone to the one across the highway.",0
"Your general fast food place with subpar service. Went here one morning to get a quick breakfast because we had no time for our usual Saturday morning spot. We ordered several different breakfast items and at the end my wife went to order a single order of three pancakes and sausage breakfast for one of the kids. At checkout it seemed expensive at first, the cashier never repeated the order back to us. When we received our order, we figured out why. She put us down for three total three pancakes and sausage breakfasts. When my wife brought it up the girl behind the register just said ""oops, sorry"" and walked away, no offer to fix it or give a refund. Great job.",0
Let just say this place would be a lot better if they had a different crew member. There is a orange red hair lady names Veronica who does the window mostly and she ALWAYS has a attitude. If you don want to work at McDonalds then gone because their are people who take customer service ,0
"I didn't used to mind this McD's.  I was happy there was an option for 24-hr food in case I wanted something on the way home from a night out with friends or just late-night munchies.  During the day, it's a pretty average McD's.  But they lost my business forever when I went by one night at 1am, pulled up to the order box, waited for five minutes, then finally someone came over the speaker and said ""Sorry we're closed"".

Closed?!  It's 24-hrs!  And I get it, sometimes 24-hr places will close one night every several months to do a deep cleaning.  I get that, I really do.  But they ALWAYS post signs and notices so you're not blind-sided by it.  Not this place.  I really don't think they were closed.  I think the workers were too lazy to do their job and decided to shut the store down so they could get paid to do nothing.

Additionally, this store has a bad habit of having a ""broken"" ice cream machine past 10pm.  It's always ""sorry, ice cream machine is broken"" if you come in after the lobby closes.

The worst part is I complained on the website.  I submitted a complaint for this store, pointing out the 24-hr and the ice cream issue.  All I got back (weeks later) was ""oh, sorry the ice cream machine was broken, we're working to upgrade all our locations but it takes time""  Not even a single MENTION of the ""closed"" 24-hr location.

As I said, it's a pretty standard McD's... which is synonymous with lazy, but this one takes the cake on it.",0
Very stringent on providing Ketchup. Last 3-5 visits I퐒e been given only 1,0
They tried to charge me for a piece of egg when I asked for a bacon egg and cheese McGriddle through the drive thru. I went inside and the manager tried to charge me when her employee never confirmed my order. All I said was sub bacon instead of the sausage and somehow the egg got taken off? I don,0
We went through the drive-through and ordered 2 bacon-cheese burgers and 2 big Mac's and we asked for them to leave the middle part (the bread in the center). We got the bacon-cheese burgers and they were fine. But the big Mac's not only still had the bread in the center but had another piece of bread on the bottom with mac-sause on them. So instead of 2 pieces of meat and 2 pieces of bread I ended with 2 pieces of meat and 4 pieces of bread. I was not amused when I got home. You can bet that I will NOT EVER stop there again.,0
I was very surprised to have come to this McDonalds while working this side of town .. Coffee was like drinking a cup of  hot water.. wow McDonalds has been known for its coffee. Not this one. Get a water instead.,0
Terrible service didn even hand me my change would rather ,0
"Always busy, sort of slow (but not too slow). Dangerous intersection, when leaving the drive thru. The food the couple of times I have been here seemed old or dry, it wasn't bad, just not very good.",0
All that I had ordered was two McDoubles and large soda. Both burgers were not just pink but Red in the center. Was the last time I have even TRIED eating fast food altogether.,0
"I am very dissatisfied with the service at this location. I asked for a #1 which is a big Mac instead they charged me for a quarter pounder. My son ordered a cheeseburger happy meal , he wanted the burger with mustard, onions, and pickles. My son was so upset and he refused to eat his food . The burger that I got slopply made and the meat was half way hanging out of the burger and it was so bad that it was almost dry. My little boy was so upset that he doesn't want to here any more. From a very mad Mommy and a hurt little boy",0
"Id only eat from here if there is no other option. Its on a good location since its kinda on my way from work to home. I finish work at 12am so i have literally no other option cause i am exhausted and not willing to drive further. Burgers are dry, patties are old, i got 4 nuggets instead of 6. In short, dont waste your money cook yourself at home.",0
"I work late nights so I come here after my shift which is well after midnight. It rare I have a good experience when the overnight staff is running the show. Missing items, the quality of the food is just not good, clearly it been sitting there for a while, and it just seems like they have difficulty getting my order. I get that it",0
"I found  pieces of hair in my food. I also had to  Pay for pancake syrup and ranch and when I open the bag they were already open and leaking into my bag.  When I called to make a complaint the manager   Did not answer it took 7 calls back-to-back an he was incredibly rude!  He told me that everyone there has passed their certification and if I don't like it I can go to the health department.  I have made a complaint with the  Texas health department. Floors are disgusting, bathrooms are disgusting!  This is the worst McDonald's I have ever been to in my life and I have traveled all over this country.",0
One star because everytime I go early in the morning this lady is always so rude. Granted I know its early but if u can't handle being up this early then maybe you should consider getting a different job. It's not okay to be rude.,0
Asked me to wait at spot one. Asked for jelly and was completely ignored. Had to go inside to get it myself. Trash customer service. I blame management for not holding anyone accountable.,0
seriously I had asked specifically no onion on both of my steak bagels meals when I got to my house they both had onions. and I had asked for picante sauce and they didn't even put sauce  packets in my bag. it just sucks getting home and not being able to eat what you expected.,0
"The personal are really nice but everytime I go there, they almost mess my order. Sometimes I pay extra for my extra toppings and They forgot to add the topings  they made it just plain. And like in the bacon mcd double I always order  that one for my daughter with only mayo en they add mac sause and she is allergic to onions. And there is always something missing in my order. ",0
"The inside smells like baby diapers. When you ask for extra sweet and sour sauce they give you a dirty look like it is such a hassle. The ice cream machine is always broken, and the food always looks like it was put together so carelessly. Guess you can't expect much from a McDonald's anyways.",0
They are always rude and get mad when they mess your order up I've never been to such a bad service place,0
One of the worst places I퐒e ever been to. Messed up almost every single item I ordered. Phone lines don,0
"Seriously, what is the deal with not being able to brew fresh sweet tea? It's sad that you have to check your drinks before you leave the drive thru. It seems as if 3 time a week we get bad tea from this location. It's not like we can just leave work to go get a new one either. We send my hubby on a drink run in the morning and he constantly forgets to take the ""taste test"" before he leaves, but he should not have to!",0
"So bad they had to re-engineer their quarter pounder! It was great, then they went cheapo, now they added some extra fat to the mix. They take their fortune for granted. It's really sad. Great fries though, if you don't get a bag of soggy burnt tip one inchers! I've learned to distrust the compnay.",0
"night crew will 100% get your order wrong, just eat sleep for dinner and wait for day crew to treat you right.",0
I had a 5 star before. But his time i bougght a southwest saldad with crispy chicken and when i reached home there was no chicken at all in my salad. Tried to call back and no one answer the phone,0
Back to no breakfast all day. Breakfast is the only thing edible at this place.,0

Dave giving me the wrong Burger two times in a row now sometimes I work till 1:00 in the morning and all I want to do is eat something so I can go home and go to sleep the sheer unnecessaryness of McDonald's saying what else what else what else is annoyingmultiple enough but to get my burger wrong times,0
"Went thru the drive thru, for breakfast. I like the Egg McMuffin meal, but that is about the only thing I'll eat off of their menu. My meal with a coke, ended up being wrong. They gave me a sausage biscuit and the coke was horrible. The line was so long, that I did not have time to wait, so I just threw it all away. I won't be coming back to this location.",0

Worst McDonald's i have ever been to.",0
Absolutely terrible. This McDonald's had a worker bleeding and throwing up all over the food and when my mother politely asked them what was taking so long (we were in the drive thru like for 20-30 MINUTES) we were bad mouthed by the manager. I'm so angry this is unacceptable,0
I went to this store last night (Oct 28) and one of the managers visible from the drive thru window wasnt wearing his mask. Very unsafe,0
First off it took forever to get my food over 20 minutes of sitting in line. Then once I got home I realized my nuggets were old/ not even dropped into the fryer a second time ha to re heat them ha.  Also I was missing half my meal.,0
Every time I go here they are always missing food items or getting my order incorrect! Their employees including the gm has a terrible attitude and it shows.,0

Not a big deal but the guy at the window on drive through said there were more then 3 NBA sauces in the bag I said ok and went home. Got home and there was nothing in the bag. Just double check everything even of they say it there. Probably wont go back to that location again....,0
Does anyone ever expect to go there for the awesome food and beyond superior customer service? Nope. It's the only place with a decent sausage biscuit without having to drive to Carl JR's in cedar park.,0
"Ordered a Happy Meal, Large Fries, and Large Coke at the drive thru. Didn't get my receipt or change, large Sprite and no straw.",0

Not open 24 hours. Only the drive-thru. Dining room actually closes very early at 10pm. Pretty dirty location too.,0
Alma does not fit the proper image or the standards of a manager.  From hickey's to over excessive make up and unprofessionalism,0

"Horrible customer service! Ordered 2 large fries. They had so much salt on them they were inedible! had to be thrown out . There was even salt on my front car seat! Looked like employee dumped an entire box of salt on them! I live 15 miles away. Took pictures to show manager ""Bridgit"" next time I returned.  She would not make good! Zero stars!",0
"Not only did my whole family and I wait on the drive through line for more than 20min but the fact that my burger came in a weird ate out way and the fries were salty soggy, and disgusting. NEVER again will I spend my money here with this type of food and service during the night hours.",0
No one cares about walk-ins anymore. Staff only give all of their attention to the drive-through. Can't even dine in anymore. My kids had to wait nearly 5 min just to ask for ketchup. Everyone was in the back and by the drive-through window.,0

My food sucked. My french fries were cold and only half full. Not to mention that they charged me 25 dollars and had to wait 20 minutes. What rip off.,0
They looked so gross from the start. They weren't even warm. They taste just as bad as they look. I also got a quarter pounder. Cheese is half on and half off the sandwich. The only good thing was the fries.,0
"Curbside is unavailable for all hours.
McDonald's app freezes in order screen frequently at this particular location...,I have great service with AT&t and new phones so I don't think it's on my end.
I have had multiple issues with old orders trying to reprocess old orderss here ,& leading to wrong food being ready at the window staff more interested in proving to me that what came through from the app was what they prepared. 4 chicken nuggets for three people. Is not adequate. They did not offer to even take a new order. I left with NO food",0
"Awful service ignored for over 5 minutes.  When we asked if someone would wait on us, we were ignored. To busy talking with each other",0
"It was terrible...again. This location just can't get things right or serve anything decent. The sandwich pictured was supposed to be a double quarter pounder w/ cheese.
Only one dried out, overdone and broken patty with cheese barely on the burger. I attempted to call...phone just rings and rings and then goes to fax noise.",0

Horrible customer service. Came here for breakfast and the employees are angry/rude and hate their job. They were annoyed the moment they asked me what my order was. I regret coming here and never will again. They forgot to give me my hash browns and were so upset and angry when I told them they forgot and they even denied it. Food was cold. Horrible experience.,0
It's not the best like it was 2 years ago but not as bad as it has been in the past.   They have to work out the mobile app ordering. They lose orders plus app says they're out of food.,0
Sorry to rate you a two but just 12 years ago you would of been rated a five. You changed your fries and they are thinner and not as good and when you got a spicy chicken sandwich it was a spicy patty and came with lettuce and tomato now it is a crispy chicken patty with spicy sauce and pickles where is the lettuce and tomato oh you have to order a deluxe.  You are getting cheaper with the food and the prices go up. Not pleased very disappointed.,0
"I was glad to hear McDonald's lowered their coffee & frappe prices & they were having a special sale. I had to repeat a simple two step iced coffee order SEVERAL times. The drive thru worker was distraught as I gave back 1st one made wrong. Another employee finished order, by running out to car. I questioned the workers about the cost & size of my drink (all 3 said it was med size - turned out to be a SMALL) & they ""got me"" a few weeks ago on that. Girl who ran out order was ONLY ONE who acted professionally & provided great customer service. SADLY, the iced coffee prices are low because drink is so small, if they could charge a fair price they would have a new regular! ",0

The food was barely warm. The cheese was cold and hard. They threw my bag of food up on the counter. What a dysfunctional restaurant.,0
Worst McDonald's I have ever been to. Staff was rude and disinterested and playing around with each other and getting drinks and walking around outside while customers waited forever for food. All booths were dirty and the chicken nuggets were exceptionally inedible. Almost like they were dropped in oil twice to be reheated. I had to give a star to write a review otherwise they would've gotten a zero.,0
They can't even make a sandwich the way that should be all ways missing something or just a big mess,0

Updated 6/27/22. This place went downhill fast.  New mgr left and people there now don't care. Food is badly made. Original review from 2020: New manager runs a nice shop!  Much different than before.  Employees actually want to work and help customers.  Definitely improved.,0
"The price of the breakfast here is very ridiculous. $9.00 for a hash brown, sausage egg and cheese mcmuffin, and a small orange. Never again.占쏙",0
Utterly DISGUSTING! Fix your septic. Someone needs to call the health department on them. You wait in the drive through and it smells like raw sewage. Nasty!,0
"Went for my rare self indulgent treat and was thoroughly disappointed. I used the Mobil app but still had to pay when I went to the window and was offered no reasonable explanation. Took twenty minutes for them to serve three cars. My order was incorrect, coke tasted way off and the sandwich looked like it was thrown in the box from across the room.",0
"Prices are much high than other McDonalds in the area (Wind Gap). Soda always seems off, never tastes the same, or even good. A few of the employees are pleasant, but there are a few who are just rude.",0

Always shake machine is down and order thr big breakfast meal that apparently doesnt come with pancakes. Worst service in the world.,0
Waiting over 30 minutes for 3 kids meals,0
"Food was alright. Wasn't really hot and my husband's bagel was stale. But it was...ok. I guess.

The place was trashed. Not one clean table and garbage everywhere, yet we were the only ones in the place the whole time we ate and very few people were going through drive thru. There were two managers on...no one thought to clean? Can't blame it on being busy...

Cashier was new and a bit rude. We ordered three meals. She rang everything up separate but left off our hash browns. Manager made us pay to get our hash browns. Forget that it was all way more expensive cause of how she rang it up to begin with...then the cashier kept telling the manager in front of us that we never said we wanted meals, even though when I repeatedly told her we wanted meals she kept saying ""sure I can make that a meal for you.""

Completely unprofessional and we left feeling disgusted by the whole experience.",0
I went through the drive-through and ordered a double Mac meal. I received a single Mac meal And the food was cold. I drove away and call back and told  Them  my meal was wrong. The manager tells me on my next visit I will receive a complimentary order. NO how about giving me the right order or given me my money back. I gave this McDonald's the benefit of Benefit of the doubt is not my 1st Bad Experience in this McDonald's. But it will be my last as I will never visit this McDonald's again.,0

Needless to say, the manager Ashleigh that answered the phone was 1. Very rude and 2. She hung up on me after I asked her to have the car in front of me pull up so I can get my meal and leave. When I got to the window, she not only disrespected me but she cursed me out and yelled at me. That is NOT a form of respect especially to a customer and not only that, the ENTIRE staff was fooling around and not getting any of their work done. Very unprofessional and needless to say, I felt very disrespected and disgusted. I have NEVER been treated in such a more disgusting way than this team that was on today. Not only that, she had her little brother Jordan message a family member of mine to complain about my own family members. I didn know they wernprofessional.

When you get your food the Coke is flat and",0
"I eat fast food maybe once a month. Have been to this McDonalds about a dozen times the past couple years, and literally every single time I've been there, they have screwed something up. These people can't even count FFS, as they gave me TWO crispy tenders in my four piece. It's mind-boggling.

Not to mention, they are ALWAYS out of at least one item I order, and the drive-thru involves pulling off and waiting for 10-15 minutes every single time, even if there is no one in the place. Complete and utter disgrace.",0
"Other than maybe a missing order, usually very nice place, but...I ordered a Quarter Pounder meal for my 8yr old child and she bit into raw meat ",0

Got home and took one bite of the Big Mac, the bread absorbed so much grease that I had grease dripping from both of my hands. The grease from the burger had absorbed into the bread so much that I squeezed the bread and grease dripped from it. The frys were not at all fresh. I threw my meal in the trash where it belonged. Called the store and spoke with John. He apologized and took my name down and I will get a refund but it doesnt help my hunger NOW. Worst encounter with McDonalds ever. And this is why I dont eat there, I'll choose Burger King next time. The carelessness of the staff there really shows and the food they produced tonight was among the worst I have ever seen in the food industry.",0

To my surprise $2.00 for a salad rotten lettuce and dried out carrots. The salad was dated tomorrow. It should have been thrown out, like I did two days. Had I seen it at the counter. I wouldn have bought it. Must be the tariff has kicked in on potatoes. The were very few fries. About a good size hand full.

"By far the worst of the franchise. This location does not sell McDonald's recipes or guidelines. 2 times i made a u-turn for over salted fries that can't be eaten for the amount of salt put on them. The burgers are not built to McD recipes they appear slopped together and backwards. To top it off the packing is without care.

I have gone there multiple times recently to find cars parked in the lot, lights on in the building, and the drive thru signs lit only to wait several minutes with no acknowledgment. I even pulled around to the window and honked and still received no response.",0
Staff was very courteous about the long wait. Management is responsible for the situation. Shouldn't have to wait 15 minutes for fast food at 8:40 am. Not the first time.,0
"The bun was dry, the fries weren't the same. I'll pass! But the Hi-C orange was good.",0
It's McDonald's for the love of God get the order right 1st of all 2nd of all put some napkins and utensils in the bag salt and pepper wouldn't kill you what apparently don't go to the drive-through because you orders not gonna get done right and egg mcmuffin should not look like to sources rig muffins then you go inside and it takes you another 20 minutes to get U dam order it's McDonald's for the love of God just pay attention I understand the pool that you have to pick from for help is very thin and limited,0
Who would,0
"Time for McDonald's to open their doors for indoor seating.
Pricing is getting out of hand as well.  Can go to red Robin for $5 more and sit down to eat.",0
This place is always so slow. Went through the drive-thru with only 3 cars in front of me. Took 20 minutes to get my food and they had four drinks prepared on the counter but mine wasn't one of them. Almost charged me for the wrong order too since they don't seem to be able to keep track of them well.,0
The lobby is open but you stand there for quite some time before your order gets taken. All attention is on drive thru,0
"You used to be able to get multiple Travis Scott special at a discount.  Now the J. Balvin Special is one per downloaded app to get the McFlurries for free.  All other orders are at 12 dollars a pop, u need to check ur order.  Short on fries and the McFlurries were half filled.  Totally disappointed.",0
"Pretty much the worst McDonald I퐒e ever had, and I",0
5 cars pulled over waiting for orders. Suddenly a burger and fries is too hard.,0
Manager was incredibly rude to my husband when he tried to place an order through the drive thru.,0
Terrible as usual. 1 out of 10 when it comes to getting a good meal.  Slow slow slow service.  Stale fries again. Worst McDonald's in the area.  Terrible fries as usual. Feel ripped off.,0
Of the fries we got they were cold. The small bad had about 10 if that. They did not add the ranch or BBQ sauce that we asked for. Horrible!,0
My daughter and I went to get slushies but they couldn't make slushies or shakes cause their machines were down.,0
Food was fine tho I have reason to believe it was spit in. Also when I requested the inspection report (as the sign clearly specifies) I was given a nasty look and was completely ignored by the cashier named Greta.,0
Worst customer service ever will not return. Food was cold and frys not cooked properly. Bread had mold on it,0
the staff is unbelievably rude and we had to wait 30 min for assistance #hurd,0
"No shakes or ice cream again, and no sign to inform. Long lines only to learn they do not have what I stopped in the purchase. ",0
Didn't have kid meals toys. Brought 8 kids to eat & no toys for none. Also looked like 2 employees was high off drugs. Will never eat there again. Maybe no McDonald's,0
Screw up my order 90% of the time when I go through drive thrue. BK is right next door. I just go there now,0
We just orders 2 bacon smoke houses and one only has 3 small pieces of bacon and 2 really small pieces of onion very little sauce. Thsecond was cold,0
The Google info says open 24 hours. It's not. Pulled up at 530am and just sat to use wifi. After a little while the morning crew came in and out up cones on all the parking spots near me. It was very strange.,0
Morning staff is good....afternoon/evening is a different story. They take the fast out of fast food!,0
The food handlers were picking up the plastic bag of shack mix with gloves off of the FLOOR on then going back to food handling. You've got to be kidding me. What are you wearing gloves for?,0
Waited literally 10 minutes for a steak egg and cheese bagel. Would of rather went to Wawa and it would of been faster and healthier.,0
Restaurant 42 the worst and the dirtiest trays that they put your food on that I've ever seen complained about it before and nobody has done anything about it as of yet so if it's restaurant 42eat at your own risk so if you're looking for a place to eat at McDonald's ask if it's restaurant 42 before you orderthey tell me tell me to come back and you'll make it right how's it going to do that when  they don't know it's me coming back,0
If there's more than 2 cars in drive thru line keep driving unless you like overcooked hollow French fries.,0
I WOULD LEAVE NO STARS IF I COULD .DRIVE THRU ORDER IS ALWAYS PLACED CORRECTLY AND BILLED CORRECTLY ON THE RECEIPT BUT FOR SOME REASON THE LINE COOKS CANT GET THE ORDERS RIGHT .EVERYTIME I COME TO THIS LOCATION MY  FOOD IS NOT MADE CORRECTLY .TODAY I CAME THRU THE DRIVE THRU AND ORDERED A DOBBLE QUARTER POUNDER MEAL NO PICKLE MED WITH A COKE I WAS CHARGED $8.47 AND I GOT BACK TO WORK I OPENED MY FOOD AND A GOT A SINGLE QUATER PONDER WITH PICKLE'S A MED FRY THAT WAS HALF BURNT AS USUAL AND A DIET COKE.

AND McDONALD'S AT ONE POINT AND TIRE WANTED MINIMUM WAGE TO BE $14 OR $15 PER HOUR THATS A JOKE !,0
Was horrible. Dry old and nasty. All of us were so disappointed. That's pretty bad when a kid says it was horrible.,0
The service was very slow today and they messed up the order. The fries were old and hard. They were cold,0
Terrible waited like 20 mins order 2 mcchicken and 1 mcdouble got 3 mcdouble smh,0
Good deals and friendly service (most of the time). The drive thru wait time is always very long.,0
"This McDonald's is really going downhill, service is slow, biscuits overcooked and crunchy, bacon burned and the place is a mess. Couldn't find a clean table.",0

This is the worst mcdonalds I have been to.  Very slow and the order is always  wrong.   Don't  go there...  This place should be shut down or change the management.   .,0
"Sadly, I get mistreated every time I come here.. I put this review off for a while now and the mistreatment continues.. The workers here need to be trained on customer service.. :(",0
This place is the one in front of the Lehigh Valley mall do not go there  there  was glass in the inside of my Burger and the manager refused to even hear me. I will be contacting corporate,0
The service at the drive in was terrible.i sat in line for 20min no one was there to take my order and then when I went inside people were waiting for orders to be filled and to be waited on.I ended up going to Burger King instead,0
Their cheeseburger costs more than a double cheeseburger and they won't give me a double cheeseburger with only 1 patty,0
Seriously who forgets to put everything on a burger. Lol I can understand missing one item but everything except the burger itself lol not once but twice lol ,0
I have been to many McDonald's locations and I have to say this was the worst Big Mac and Filet sandwich I have ever had. I was highly disappointed!!!,0
I applied online and said I was fourteen and out on my resume I was fourteen and I get scheduled for an interview and they say I can be hired be,0
I waited over 15 minutes in drive thru after I paid and got to the pickup window . Was asked pull-up and wait .,0
"Long wait times for the drive-thru. They jerk you around with their open/close times, too. They close at eleven, I drove by at 10 after ten and they said they were closed for the night.",0
You would find the Covid-19 vaccine here before you found a working ice cream machine,0
They just hung up on me when I was talking. It was not relating to poor connection.,0
They dont have good customer service. Plus they dont listen to customers.,0
Doesn't honor coupons when they clearly state at McDonald's nationwide. Managers are rude.,0
I had a drink n cheese burger n the burger n cheese was colder the ketchup.... it's rare to ever get a hot chburger at McDonald's,0
This was the worst. They had no fountain drinks and the water they substituted for it was warm.,0
Waited in the drive up.10 minutes. Should had the man in front park instead of waiting at yhe window for his stuff.,0
The McDonalds in Brodheadsville is one of the worst McDonalds I've ever experienced. Its sad our own hometown McDonalds is the way it is,0
Paid$4.01 for what used to be $1.00 to greedy for me never again,0
Wost McDonald's ever very nasty manager Anna And the employee's are rude and nasty,0

Service is hit or miss.  Give you fries that are half full.,0
Service was slow  came home and order was missing 2 sandwiches,0
Gift card didn't work AGAIN. No help from clerk  Rude.,0

Hash browns are always cold and under-cooked.,0
Ordered a large fry and they were burnt had to go back and they were still overdone,0
Even after expressing items that were missing they still got it wrong,0
30 minutes in drive thru.... Ridiculous,0
Worst service ever. Slow and always forget items.,0
Service wasn't the best and my food was cold,0

"I placed a mobile order when I was at the McDonald's at 72-69 Kissena Blvd, Flushing, NY 11367. I placed that order on March 29, 2023 at 07:48:29 PM. This order should be brought to table 101. The McDonald app said that in 2 or 5 minutes, somone will bring my order. I waited for 15 minutes. I still did not see my order at table 101. I went to the counter and asked for it. A lady saw a tag with 101 on the counter and then she prepared for my order, and then gave it to me. I asked her why no one brought me the order. She did not say. Then, I asked for the manager. Then, a gentleman named Armando showed up. I told him what happened. He first told me that they were busy. However, there was no one waiting at the counter. I told the manager that the lady who prepared my order saw my order tag on the counter. Then, the manager changed his explanation. He said that after 7 PM, they don't serve table service. In other words, they don't bring order to the table after 7 PM. I said that the Mcdonald's app says that the table order is still available. Then, he said that every store is different. I doubt what he said. This is bad servcie and bad responses from the store manager. The manager lied.",0
"Horrible service from the manager. I got 2 cheeseburgers from the drive thru and my bag was leaking with some fluid. Looked inside and both was soaked in oil. The burger was drenched in oil and the wrapper had puddles of oil inside it and once i opened it, it went on my pants and console of my car. Went inside to get another burger but instead the manager tried to justify saying she did it herself and it wasn like that and that it just came out. But I tried to explain there was so much oil everywhere that when I tried to pick up the burger it slips right out of my hand and the oil is spilling everywhere. Even when I got a new burger she still insisted on justifying why it was like that instead of apologizing to a customer. I퐒e never had that experience with just trying to eat a cheeseburger. Not even a restaurant does that. Didn폾nce was.",0
The service was horrible. The kiosk machine printed a record with no numbers on it. The staff was calling numbers without saying the order. The atmosphere was Workers waiting for their checks & requesting food infront of paying customers. Was a very unpleasant experience.,0

"Large fry half full
No straw
Cold food even though it was the fastest delivery of my life",0
I've gone twice after work around 10 and my food is served cold n the most recent they gave me my food n not my drink had to tab on window multiple times to get someone's attention to then be questioned about it as if they didn't just give me my food n they watered down the drink because I guess they didn't like having to come back and finish the order. I hate to down talk a business but your a fast food chain such things should not be happening.,0
"Placed an order through an ordering app.   When it arrived, half of the food was missing.  I called the restaurant to try to resolve the issue and they told me I had to come and pick up the missing items.  I told them I am at work and that this won't be possible.   According to them there was nothing they could do then.  They refused to refund me for the missing food from my order.  I guess if they don't pack the food you paid for properly it's your problem?  Not a great way to do business.",0
"The worst McDonalds and its not even the place its the employees! Not all but the majority of them can NEVER get the order right! Either they give you the wrong order or theyre are items missing. Like ALWAYS!!! I order from door dash and every f_____ time I receive it there are items missing, the last time I ordered a Medium Fries, and literally half of it was filled. Rip you off! It takes forever to get your order as well I understand they have a lot of customers but hello, be considerate and get the orders right!!",0
"My child worked there for only two days and was forced to quit due to the unprofessionalism of the management and staff, one manager even followed her into the bathroom.

The most most unprofessional place I have ever heard of and the franchise wonder should be aware of how unprofessional and terrible the employees are. Trai",0
"Bought a McChicken Bundle with cheeze no mayo!

I addressed it and they were willing to change it but I had (their ) Uber delivery customer waiting in hand and I couldn wait for mine to be prepared while the customers food got cold! I said I would be back with them knowing me !

When I asked the driver he said he even asked if there was any food and stated the employee said no. Not sure who would only order orange juices, for the trouble and price the corner store juice is way better. Deliveries need to be handled better, not the first time missing items or a whole order.",0
"There is a major problem with this McDonald's!! I have been coming here for years, and I put up with alot of inconveniences! Non the less, last night was appalling!! What's wrong with the girl cashier tan skin, black hair, the Hispanic or Indian girl with the yellow long press on nails?! Im sure you can single her out of the crowd. I wont say her name even though they all kept saying eachothers names out loud like it was high school musical back there. Is it mandatory for her to not give me my receipt? I , like many other hardworking Americans who have been coming here for as long as we all can remember,  need a receipt; especially just incase how fast food workers forget to give us all of our order.. and wouldn't you know it, not only did they fail to give me my receipt,  but they failed to give me the correct order. I asked for my order more than three times! Is it also part of the owner's of McDonald's policy to berate the customer in Spanish? I'm Puerto Rican and I understand everything they was saying. How rude to have said all of that in front of the customer,  and about the customer.  Is this how you value your rewards members? I'm going to post about my experience on any social media platform! Mark my words! I would also like to state that the woman manager allowed her staff to keep acting maliciously and she acted as if nothing was going wrong. Is this how you run your establishment?!
The African American fellow, tall, with a kind of lisp, gave me again the wrong order and the wrong receipt. Must be nice to pick out the garbage a receipt from three hours ago to give to me, thinking i wouldnt know the difference! The owner should pop on in!! Must Like losing out on money.

She then starts going back and forth to another lady, who told her apparently that wasn true. They stayed going back and forth until I had to wave down another worker walking by.

They never know what people order, they put wrong food in the wrong bags, they have trouble following special instructions, and you'll be you'll be lucky if you deal with a nice cashier. I'm allergic to many things and had asked the cashier to make sure she did not put those products in my birth lose products in my Burger, however everything I named was in my Burger my Burger rather than out of my Burger.. These employees will fight with you until you are out of breath, they never admit they're wrong. And the coffee here is always made incorrectly I don't understand why.

"I like the convenience of this McDonald's for  parking and drive thru,  the food is fresh and the place is clean,though I think because of the Covid increase they don't let anybody sit inside. My problem is the workers organization. Nobody is at the register or someone to help you at the kiosk. One kiosk machine did not give you a receipt, another gives you just a white paper. Long wait to pick up order, took like 20 minutes. Once you get your order it is missing items from your order. Today, I was missing hashbrowns. I also ordered hot chocolate with caramel and I got coffee  instead. I did not change it because two weeks ago, the same thing happened and I had to wait 20 more minutes for them to give me the hot chocolate. I thought that was an isolated incident but it happened again today. For this reason I'm not coming back to this place ever again. Goodbye!!!",0
This mcd is the worst service ever. Don't come here,0
"I just walked in to get myself some breakfast and was told that they're closed, that they can't turn the registers on yet. Why is a place known for serving breakfast closed at 7:30 am? Seems pretty unprofessional.",0
Worse customer service I have ever experienced. I dont know how a mobile order can take 30 mins to load on their screen. Or why no one can help you at drive thru apparently it would work if you walk into the store??? No you should get a manager or someone who wants to help instead of people telling you that your holding up their line. As far as I though I was still a customer. Not everyone would like to go into the store especially with covid. Just learn to help people instead of treating people like cattle.,0
I bought a Big Mac..  I was eating And I saw a hair on the meet..  never ever going to buy in this place,0
It's a busy place.  Employees are not very friendly. I only come to this location for the convenience but they usually very slow.  I always need to check my orders before I leave because they frequently missing stuffs or got it wrong.,0

"Too expensive for the type of service they provide. They treat you as if they were doing you a favor and you pay for yr meal.  What for do they ask if you want mailk and sugar for yr coffee if at the end you have to ask anyway. Horrible service, and with a mean face. If you don't like yr job quick it and get a job you like. You talk to them and they ignored you.",0

Wanted to order food, however they told me they were closed and when I drove past they pointed and laughed at me.",0
"FASTFOOD? I use the drive thru, I ordered a oatmeal, the attendant told me is $2,71. Next window I pay with $10 bill she charge me $7,51. I told her something is wrong because I just order oatmeal, she was rude and told me is not my mistake next window somebody is going to take care. After 5 minutes the manager came and said I going to give you $2 more to complete the change. No sense to make people lost time, after this complete failure I decided to cancel my order because, the attendant and the manager don't not how to make simple additions and subtraction. Use a calculator to add 1+1. 17 minutes take all this simple equation.",0
"This is the worst Macdonald you can imagine, the customer service deserves 0 stars and the employees don't care at all if your happy or not with the food you paid for. They will give you a nasty attitude for no reason when you ask for BBQ sauce they tell you they are out of BBQ and give you look like your asking for something they shouldn't have.",0

"Check your food before you leave!
My experience was horrible, the girl who hands out the order has the worst attitude, i get it you work at mcdonalds but you choose to be there.
I asked for a quarter pounder and all i got was a buns and a patty, going back and dealing with that girl was such an inconvenience, if you can avoid this place, do so.",0

"Horrible location. Frequently makes mistakes with larger orders. Almost every time we come here with larger orders there are missing items. Rude employee as well. One time refused to give me receipt at drive thru.
Was there yesterday also, and the employee at the drive thru window did not wear mask properly. Only half the mouth was covered and the nose was not covered at all. Note that this McDonald's is located in one of the NYC Covid hotspots.",0

I say no, I'll wait here, please just give me my soda. She would rather argue then just fill the cup with soda. She tells me that I'm making everyone in the drive through wait. I said no McDonald's sloppy order taking is making me wait. I encourage everyone to not pull up out of the way when fast food restaurants screw up. They do that so ""corporate"" doesn't yell at them for having slow initial order to window pickup time. Do the job right and orders will be fast.",0
Terrible experience. Nobody knows what's happening. I ordered at the kiosk and wanted to pay cash. When I went to pay the girl just took my money and left. Didn't give me the cup I paid for or the new receipt with the order. 2 people then told me I didn't pay when I infact did but the other girl didn't give me nothing. Won't be coming back.,0

"We didn't enjoy our visit to this McDonald location.  The ice tea was warm, our fries and burger were cold and rubbery. The only thing I enjoyed was my cappuccino. We will not be visiting this McDonald's again. It wasn't that busy for them not to have hot fresh food prepared.",0
"Me and my wife always love McDonald's especially their fires but this place make me rethinking McDonald's service mindset. I have order there a couple time but they never ever give condiment when ask at the drive thru. I always had to double check and remind them again when picking up the order. What really disappointed me and make me laugh was a month ago I order two Cheeseburger and to my surprise I got bread, pickle, cheese, and ketchup??? There was no beef. Again today, I thought maybe I'll us the mobile app to order for the first time and just maybe just maybe they will get my order right. No surprise and usually I don't write about these little things but when it happen over and over again that irritate me. McDonald really need to improve their service in the US. I have been to other countries McDonald and never have gotten these kind of service. Sadly McDonald has good food but bad service.",0

"New building, same poor service. Frankly, for service to be this bad for this long, it becomes harder to blame the workers and easier to blame management. Went to the drivethrough at 2am and ordered some value menu sandwiches...after waiting nearly 20 minutes for them to process a single order (with three cars in front of me), I decided to leave. Their credit card machine is also down intermittently.",0
Ordered a 6 piece nugget received 5 pieces. inflation to damn high for McDonalds to be playing with my nuggets.,0
"Tl;Dr poor service, frequently gets orders wrong.

We try and avoid this place even when we specifically have a hankering for McDonald's. We always have an issue at this McDonald's no matter what time of day,  whether we order from a food delivery service or in person. The orders always get screwed up,  from missing items to getting a sausage egg and cheese mcgriddle that just had cheese! If there was other fast food options besides pizza and halal nearby we'd probably never go here again.
But today I finally understood why it's a mess: there's no communication. It was a busy time since school had just let out and I stood for about 5 minutes waiting for a Dr. Pepper and watched the crew work in relative silence while pushing out food orders without tickets and without speaking to each other. Anyone who has worked in food service knows a quiet kitchen spells more trouble than a loud one. Eventually my sister flagged down the man doing drink orders and asked if the drink he'd just placed in the row of 8 other drinks he'd been setting down indiscriminately was our Dr. Pepper and he said yes...it was a Coke.
Management here really needs to have a talk to the crew about working together as a team and communication, especially when it's busy. Yes it's just a McDonald's, and I'm not expecting white glove service from a fast food joint, but our community deserves better than what we're getting for sure.",0
"Clean, new McDonald's with a new policy of lunch beginning at 11am - even though their menus start showing lunch at 10:30am... Found no mention of the change anywhere in the internet when checking for lunch start before going, so I had to sit for half an hour to wait for lunch....
One thing that is still classic McDonald's? Their poorly trained, rude staff. Don't assume I know that lunch is at 11 because ""it has been this way since we reopened"". Classic McDonald's - poor customer service experience...",0
Worst McDonald's every they never get an order correct they never give ice in their drinks and serve warm soda! Takes forever to get the order then it is not correct! The phone number is out of service so you can't even call to complain! WORST MCDONALDS EVER!!!!,0

Very Bad experience. I was harassed by managers Named Rocio and Roberto. They brought a negative experience and were screaming at customers and employees...,0
The managers are bad. They get your order wrong most of the time. Do not walk out without checking your bag. 15 minute wait at night. The Filipino manager doesn't know anything and usually have to be reminded by staff. Need to stick to Burger King. These other people posting positive things apparently work there because all you see is people returning with their order.,0
"The best thing about this McDonald's is the cleanliness compared to most McD restaurants in Queens. The worst thing about it is the staff. They pay no mind to customers waiting in line to have their order taken even when it isn't even busy in the slightest. Sometime they don't give me my receipt. Sometime my order will be ready in the bag, but they'll set it aside, and realize it much later, as I watch them complete other orders wondering why mine is taking too long, and it turns out my order was read all along, they just never bother to call the number. I can go on and on... almost everyday it's something different.
Two stars is the best I can do.",0
Attitude with no straws or ketchup. I torture myself by coming here because I always hope the customer service will improve. The staff's unprofessionalism has helped me to decide to detox from fast food.,0
The worst experience ever. I was cursed at by an angry female employee. Which i heard from the other employees that she has done this before. They said the manager and her are either family or real good friends.,0
"Never get my order right in the drive through then told to pull over we will bring your food in a moment. Defeated the whole point of the drive thru experiance dont you think. If it wasnt for my child wanting his happy meal, I myself always make it a point to skip this place.",0
We usually bought in this McDonald's but after a really bad service with the server. I didn't come back anymore also I try to solve my problem with the manager and he started yelling at me. I told him don't worry I will make a complaint with the Corporation but this not work neither. The woman who answered said every owner train their manager to know how to deal. Then I come few days later and the forget my ranch I said I will pay extra and they said no sorry only one is the only I can give you. And every time I come I buy 3 kids meal because my kids are 3.. Thewomantook the complaint but never contact me. Rude employees... I pay for 3 kids meal I was in the restaurant eating they forget my chicken nuggets in the 3 orders thewomanwho took my order found then the hispanicy for that... Never you will see me here again we go to another McDonald's close to our house there's no kids playground but they treat you better.,0
"Worst place ever! Young man on speaker does not listen to order and does not type it on the reciet all the time, girls in front are always lost and if something is written on the receipt they still don't read it. They also get annoyed when you ask for stuff to be fixed like more cream in coffee, or a sauce you did not which goes with the meal that was on the receipt, etc. Also very sloppy throw food in bag upside down like nuggets or tenders,  also don't wrap the sandwiches well and the papers all greasy, ketchup on top of fries. Always try to get orders out on an unrealistic timer ever for a fast food place and once that happens they close out the order and make you pull to the side to wait for food while 3, 4 people behind get to leave with there orders. It's ridiculous! Just give the whole order at the window this isn't a race and people everywhere else have to wait there turn to complete there orders and go. The weekend crew is even worse!",0

I use my mobile app come in the drive tru its a hit or miss depending who is working some say next window pick up my order and good but then the guy says come inside....i tell him i picked drive thru not inside and he's like i dont do mobile orders. I go inside to the lady i tell her i have a mobile order i give her the number and all she does every single damn time is say wait over there by the other mobile people. 40 minutes later im just so sick and tired of waiting you would think they would ask what is your order or van we help you nope. I ask where is my mobile order i give the number again and they say oh i dont see it. I got so pissed that they wasted my time again that i just left. Other times they get my order and say i didnt pay im like yes i did the app has my card and i pay with the app. 5 minutes later the lady like well i dont see it u have to pay.

Situations like this is a regular occurance.  In addition, there is a male manager there who yells at his employees all the time. Once he pounded on the drive through window and yelled toward me to get my attention. Not a very nice gesture at all.",0
"This place is known to always get your order

He took my order and he didn't even know the menu. Gave the wrong order..
And he talked nasty to customers.

I think  MacDonald's head quarters should go and check up on this place specially on give a  training to employees and managers in how to  give an excellent service. But this is not a plasent place to have a Burger..

I am giving 1 star because you can't give a half. I will start driving another 20 min away before I come here again. IF YOU GO THROUGH DRIVE THROUGH CHECK YOU'RE ORDER EVERY TIME 10 out of the last 10 times I did order was wrong. Small fries have more fries then the large. If you order a Big Mack you will either get no mac sauce or more sauce then meat and bread. The staff is horrible drive through sucks and even if you go inside you will have to return to counter atleast 3 times before you get everything.

"Not a very pleasant McDonald's to visit.
#1 the area for the lines is small. So expect to be cramped when it's busy, and be confused as to where the lines are, and where they start.
#2 the employees are not friendly, I wouldn't say they're mean, but they obviously don't care about any pleasantries, or seem to care about you.
#3 there is no where in the store an area where you can grab napkins, or ketchup, or straws. You have to go up to the counter and ask them for packets and straws and utensils, during lunch time when lines are longer and it's getting congested at the counter, it makes it worse when people have to constantly come up to the counter and ask for something.

I don't recommend coming here if you want to stop and relax for food.",0

Homeless hang out here, not saying they should be kicked to the curb but the place smells.

She said thats the only other option, I am charging you for a plain sundae.  I reiterated that a sundae is defined by ice cream with topping.  The cashier made me over pay for my ice cream in a cup.

"Thursday at 2:56 am. I went in here to order. A very unfriendly and rude guard sits table and he says, 폶o close, yo close.?However, two other customers were ordering using the kiosk. I tried to argue with him, but I just left because I didn't want to talk to a rude person. McDonald's is a big company. If they have cleaning hours, they must notify Google. This early hour should not cause customers to walk in vain to this place. They are wasting their customers' time and are not considerate. Because of these little things, McDonald's image",0
"It is a 24 hr location, when I arrived and tried to order & use the restroom I was told the restroom was closed. I said I will order right after my use of the restroom but they still rejected with rude attitude. I already told them I퐉 having shivers and can",0
"The homeless are a huge problem, yesterday a woman snatched my  off the table while I was eating, I had to wrestle with her to get it back she's cursing and screaming me, the staff everyone stands there watching. McDonald's stores have a real problem with the homeless. The second big issue is that this McDonald's is right across from Madison square garden a very busy area, every day a 3 pm right before it gets busy they close the upper level of seating, and then instruct you to sit with strangers. The deals are nice and the loca",0
"Came here at 430a... thought it was supposed to be open 24 hours...  saw a mcd employee inside.., and he had the door tied off with a trash bag... said they were closed... idk bout that... seemed a little off...",0
"Most of the staff were nice but what peeves me is the quality of drinks...
The coca cola needs to be calibrated correctly [ more syrup] BUT THE ICED TEA TASTED LIKE COFFEE!!!
After i walked all that way for take home.
As a stockholder I LOVE MCDONALDS...but not today.",0
At 2:34 pm 1/22/2023 the manager working there with the mole on her face made very racist remarks behind their back to the customers ahead of us and was very rude to me and my wife when asked for an extra straw since the paper straws never last. Disgusting behavior and attitude coming from a manager. 0/10 would not recommend.,0
Food was bad. They barely put special sauce on Big Mac. I couldn't really taste the sauce at all.,0
"The place wasn't clean, 4 seats upstairs closed,no place to sit.",0
Really slowwwwwwwww action and no service at all,0
This McDonald's has a sign posted open 24hrs but at 1:10 am they had ppl waiting outside with the doors close. Its cold and the staff is very unprofessional. I doubt the corporate office knows about this,0
Awful. Food sat there 20 mins until i complained and they put it in a bag and gave it to me,0
Lied and said they were out of food,0
"Ordered a large unsweetened iced tea.  Received a large cup of something.  Barely colored water. Guy asked me if I wanted another.  I said no if it comes out of the same pot, then the next wouldn't be any better.  I left with some colored water pretending to be tea.",0
The Atmosphere must change ! Too much homelessness!,0
"Staff is slow and rude, restrooms are not available",0
"Wanted to try their new crispy chicken sandwich on a potato roll & was so disappointed. I expected crispy but what u got was a burnt piece of chicken you could barely bite into, you could tell the same piece had been cooked several times that day. It was disgusting that they even served it to me like that. I took 2 bites & it went directly in the trash.",0
They gave me cold apple pies and stale chicken nuggets I want my money back,0
Very good and efficient. The problem is that the third floor is always close at the hours of 7 pm till all night. And it's difficult to find a seat. I don't understand why you would build a McDonald's with a floor that you hardly used. Plus some of the security are rude to the costumers other then that service is very good,0
"This McDonald's is terrible. I ordered Sprite and they gave me something that is like 10% Sprite and 90% water (I know the taste because I made the same mistake when I was young). Not only did this happen to me, it happened to another customer. Would not recommend.",0
"Never have I ever seen an employee THAT lost for real, and I used to work at McDonalds so I saw some madness but here... We were there at 9pm today in case any manager wants to speak with the girl I had to deal with (she is wearing glasses and was the one delivering the orders). We ordered 2 menus, 2 shakes and a sundae. The waiting wasn long at all. She calls us and give us the sundae then move along. I퐉 waiting and she looks at me like what are you waiting for?, well, the rest of my order Becky, i didn pay 30$ for a sundae.
So she sigh realising there was when you are in a hurry don",0
"Took forever to get a simple cup of coffee. They seemed totally unprepared for the amount of customers, all while in a prime location that must always have a lot of customers. 7th ave & 34th St, NYC.",0
"NEVER GO HERE - HORRIBLE SERVICE. They're always rude!!! Either they're RACIST or just plain rude. I asked for a paper bag 3 times and the two Spanish ladies ignored me despite making eye contact. The one at the pick up counter gave a little nod then walked away even though the paper bags were right next to her!! Then I went to the cashier and she just gave me a blank look and motioned to the pick-up counter without saying a word. Then I told the girl yet again, that I need a paper bag please and she just gave me a dumbfounded look with a twang of annoyance and walked away and then fave out more orders. They were just so rude and every other time I've been there! They were all Spanish and maybe don't like Asians but they're horrible people and I never want to go to this location ever again!!!",0
"The staff decided that there were no longer any mcflurries, after they prepared 2 sundaes and a milk shake . Suddenly the icecream machine was broken. A Spanish speaking customer after me was then able to order not only a milkshake but3 mcflurries. When I inquired about it I was told that it was now fixed although no one has gone near the machine during the time since I was denied IN ENGLISH. I then stepped outside to get my friends and tell them our food was ready, they took the tray and headed up while I put our other friend in an Uber. When I came back in security who had just been no more then 5 feet from me while I ordered, paid, and received my food, made someone come down to confirm that I was a paying customer. If only the counter staff was as particular as the security guard.
I won't be coming back here again, at least until my Spanish is better",0
"Dirty, very dirty. Absolutely disgusting. Staff kicking off food from the floor instead of cleaning it.",0
"Horrible rude staff. One girl in particular. Honestly don't know how she is there.food was fine, plenty of seating, clean but would never go here again. Definitely would not recommend because of her attitude.",0
"They disabled the order kiosks by taking away all the number tents and requiring them. Then i get in a line, which is designed to handle the overflow, not the whole store... 2 cashiers and 25 people. Nice long wait. Then, they didn't give my mcflurry a mix at all. If i wanted a cup of vanilla ice cream with oreo topping, i wouldn't have ordered a mcflurry.",0
"The food was cold, I couldn't sit in the restaurant to eat it and the service was slow. Not to mention overpriced for what they gave me.",0
Restrooms weren't available.,0
"The big chicken sandwiches it's not what you see in the commercial on TV not crunchy at all ! chopped up lettuce wilted and small thin slice of tomatoe not fresh,not enjoyable at all!",0
"Ordered a large smoothie and this guy gave it to me half full, and the guy was rude and when I told him to full it for me he fill it up wit ice no flavor",0
A very busy McDonald's! Whay under staffed! One young man seemed to be doing all the work involving the food. While they left a inexperienced young lad on the register. She told me my daughter could not have a Dr. Pepper cause it was not a drink choice for the cheeseburger meal. This sounded absurd so when I asked her to explain this she told me no we are just out of it. She was supper sweet and at this point I came to realize only her and the other young man were the only 2 working. As the manager sat there holding a mop and did literally nothing for 20 min. So many McDonald's in NYC and this one was in all Honesty just AWFUL!!,0
Slow service the self order kisoks were broken and the restaurant was filthy.,0
"Terrible service.

I came into the store and bought my dinner at 9pm.  I sit there for 1 hour and then the staff came to me and asked me to leave. I thought that the store might be closing so I left. However, after I came out, I noticed that this is a 24 hour store. I bought food and no one else was waiting for a table. There was no reason for letting me out. The staff was rude!!!",0
"First time I came here was okay but then I came again and I퐉 waiting for fries for more than 10 minutes... I understand that if I퐉 waiting for fresh, hot fries but it does not tak",0
The slowest place I have ever been to. People where not nice at all and after we waited an hour they still didn't give us all we ordered. Pick a different place!,0
Its pretty much yhe same as most mcdonalds in the city..least this one is kept clean .only unpleasant sights are all the homeless dirtbags and all the drug addicts that hang around in front and beg for money indide just walk right up to people while their eating  ask for money beg for your food..other then that pretty good for a coty McDonalds....,0
It's not the same good tasting food like the 60s70s and 80s it's garbage now except for some of the breakfast food,0
On McDonalds I've ever been to that has a security guard. Does not let you pee before you order. Other than that the place is clean and fine.,0
Just bad service wasn't busy but the food took 15-20 mins,0
Horrible staff i was forced to hurry up and eat by security so someone else could eat comfortably without being bothered i spent my hard earned money in there i should be able to take my time to eat.,0
"Very poor customer service, rude staff, and we paid for a burger and fries that did not come and the manager did not believed we didn't receive it even with the receipts.. I've never seen anything like it before",0
"The store is up to date very small and with exception of a few the staff sucks. The few taking orders cool, the people getting the food the worst! Period!!!",0
"I ordered 2 cheeseburgers with no onions and they gave me two hamburgers with onions I went back for them to fix it, I waited 20 minutes and they gave me the exact same thing",0

"I waited 12 minutes for a cappuccino, I asked them about it and they forgot my cup on another counter. The coffee was cold and took way too long, but I didn't get any compensation for it. The kiosks where all busy for several minutes. Not recommended if you're in a hurry.",0
"We had to ask for our order because people before us were getting served, and there were employees in the back cursing and being loud with each other. Very uncomfortable experience",0
Worst customer service !! Cashiers were  so rude. Altercation broke out and cops had to get involved. Supposed supervisor was at scene but was unable to help situation. Whenever visiting nyc. NEVER VISIT THIS MCDS !!!!,0

"Very poor McDonald's in terms of service and friendliness. Could only get food in a bag. Long wait and no overview in the numbers of the orders. We were 5 people and a large part of the order was missing. Fortunately, that was quickly arranged after having to wait again. Apparently upstairs where you can sit closed at 8 pm. Fifteen minutes before, a lady came to report that they were closing. She kept holding the door open until everyone had actually left. After 5 minutes we also left and the rest were able to eat in the rain. Something is seriously wrong there.",0
"The food was good, the speed of the order to withdraw online was fine, but it was 8:25 a McDonald's worker came in and told us in a very bad way that we had 5 minutes to finish eating and we had just started eating.",0
"The worst experience I've ever had in my life!! With saying that I could not taste the food! A restaurant where the staff yells at you is not worthy of being visited by ANYONE!! Sure, I must be specific! It was in this specific place, but they should take action!!",0
"Flee, at 10 p.m. 5 seats to eat inside. We have to take out!",0
I was very bad there at 4:45 and the attention of a lady raises a lot to be desired I came from a long trip I arrived at the station but she was in a bad temper I asked her for something and reluctantly she told me that they did not have more than breakfast I could not hear in short bad service,0
"The truth is that in the USA in Queens they don't even let you sit in a drive tru, it's very ugly.",0
"You get your food stowed in a bag as standard whether you want to eat in or take it with you. Sauce on the Mc fish fillet also oilier than normal. Furthermore, this Mc on 34th street was dingy.",0
"Horrible, the hamburger does not taste like anything, I like Burger King better",0
"The fries are too salty. There is no healthy food, it generates bad habits and expensive prices",0
"Very ugly place, dirty, they don't let you go to the bathroom you have to show the ticket. Very bad",0
"Just like everywhere else, but in the USA with a very different audience. curious",0
Way too expensive!!!!,0
The burger was ok but the coke had no gas...占쏙,0
Bad attention. The cashier making a face and super rude. Other than that there is no refill,0
Not 24hrs! They said it was 24 hours and they said they would clean it and wait. what,0
"Not worth it at all, Macs are better in Italy!",0
Here I ate my last Mac hamburger of my life. It is a promise. Never more,0
Very dirty and with the presence of homeless people in the office,0
"Terrible, like all NY Mcdonalds, always dirty.",0
The girl at the front very bad customer service.,0
One of the worst I've been to. pretty dirty,0
Error in the orders and do not fill the fries,0

"4/25/23 10pm-10.30 pm 2 stars for Juan who was a very understanding manager and who completely tries satisfying customer needs by keeping open the restroom for us. However, the lady working on cleaning duty resisted obeying Juan orders and consciously tried to stop us from using the restroom by creating excuses to the manager such as cleaning time and no paper towels. These hardships  invented by ",0
"Last night, I went to buy food around 11:00 pm while I was waiting for my food, I wanted to use the bathroom but it was closed. I asked a short African American boy for the key, who seemed to be the manager because he had a different uniform. and he told me that there not  bathroom. I told him that I already ordered food and I showed him my receipt, and he answered me again that there is no bathroom in a very rude way... he told me, take your food and go.

By the way, when I entered he ",0
"this is the worst mcd I've ever visited.
the illumination is dark, atmosphere depressing and everything looked worn out.
asked to order first in order to use the washroom. so I ordered a coffee. then the staff took a key and escorted you.
funny the way how he unlocked the door. Made me feel he's opening a vault in bank.
On the way out, I gave my coffee to a panhandling man who had 10x better manner than the staff inside.
An I whining too much?  perhaps. That's in NYC after all.",0
"Terrible restrooms. Average place. If you order from mobile to serve on a table, forget about it... You'll have to go pick it up. I don't mind that, at least inform that the order is ready to pick up, don't leave us hanging! Never coming here anyway. Giving 4 stars for food because its McDonald's, what can go wrong with pre-made food?",0
"This is a below average McDonald's.  The self-ordering machines don't print receipts with your number so you better catch it on the screen because they may or may not see it on the system.  Fortunately, I was only getting some sodas and they didn't question my order but if it had been a real order it might not have gone smoothly.",0
Worst service I had experience in years. Bathroom was closed before 8pm and they did not empathize with me desperately needing to go pee so I had to go to a nearby pizza place to use the restroom. I ordered 2 medium Frappe and they gave me small. I would not recommend anyone because they do not seem to care about providing basic needs to its customers.,0
Very dirty. Served cold drinks warm and without ice and very unorganized.,0
"A friendly and responsive staff delivered (twice after I brought it back) coffee that was not hot. After the second time, I just gave my cup to my daughter whose iced coffee was way too light with cream and diluted. Surprised that McDonalds quality control failed on this visit.",0
Security guard was threatening customers who wanted to use the bathroom. He threatened to pull a knife on a customer who urgently needed to use the restroom before purchasing his meal.,0
"04:18am 10.22.22It is written around the clock and there is nothing around the clock here, one deception is that there is something that is around the clock.

It is written that it works 24 hours, you arrive, nothing works there, it's a lie!!!",0
"Bad service. Waited over 30 mins for one order. Overnight weekend manager had a terrible attitude, was yelling and cursing at both employees and customers. I feel bad for the employees there for having to work under that stress",0
Just because the kiosks were there they didn wanna help. I couldn access the order I wanted so I went to the front tried to tel them 3 times but they didn,0
"Disgusting customer service literally every time I come here. Workers are lazy, snarky, and rude. Today I ordered large fries and a lady there slammed my fries on the counter and had an attitude when my name was called twice. If you don't want to work with the public, please find a new job.",0
Horrible service. Employees look like zombies.. not welcoming at all. If you want to use the restroom there a ,0
So I went to order a hot chocolate and ordered it myself on one of there  machines.  I spent  10 minutes waitin for my medium hot chocolate. I saw there was only 3 people workin and figured they were short staffed. So I finally tell one of da girls dat I've been waitin over 10 mins and she tells me there's no hot chocolate and now I'm  upset cuz now I'm late to work!! If there was no hot chocolate then they  should post it on da screen  sayin not available. Not cool to mess wit someone's time!!! I then had to wait another 3 mins for a manager to refund  me.,0
Worst place save your money  ,0
"Very rude staff, the food was dry, and the store smelled weird. Go somewhere else.",0
Horrible poor service all they do is mess orders up use containers to serve customers skinny blonde spanish girl just horrible someone fire her,0
Truly and CONSISTENTLY the worst McDonalds I퐒e ever been to. If not for the proximity to my home I폻 drive by without a glance. How can they be out soda?????  I can,0
"Is almost 6 pm, a lot of people waiting and you closed the dining area??? It has no sense",0
"the second floor is closed, very dirty, you can't get into the toilet.",0
"I bought an hazelnut coffee.. I received an extremely milky coffee and it didn't have any ice, I asked what happened to the ice, I was told they didn't have anymore. So why allow me to purchase an ice coffee.. Hash brown was hard as an rock.. Sausage egg mcmuffin was just thrown together. They need to get it together as far as Quality Control..

I usually don't write reviews I felt compelled to do so..",0
"Out of all the McDonald's restaurants, this location had to be the worst - purely because of customer service.
Last night (22/10), whoever worked there needs to be let go. We and other customers were yelled at - the virtual cash register was not working with the receipt, so my boyfriend went to the front register to pay and the worker yanked the card out of my bfs hand, sighed like super annoying. When he turned around to wait,  we heard him saying out loud 'customers are so stupid, not listening"" :/
Myself and some other customers got yelled at for sitting down. I also needed go to the bathroom but didn't know it was shut but got yelled at. Not sure what was going on with rather staff but rude did not cut it.",0
I ask for bathroom and they told me the manger take the key . Shame in you .,0
A basic McDonald's but lately the restrooms are out of service In a couple of McDonald's even if you're a paying customer And sometimes  I noticed closing  off portion of the dining rooms  in some of the McDonald's when the places are busy,0
Very very poor service. Employees screaming and yelling and cursing to guest. So unprofessional,0
"the most terrible Donalds in New York!  The Big Mac is thin and wet, the French fries are rancid and lack the crunch.  The toilet is closed!  Cola is out of stock!",0
Good to know they are open 24/7 now,0
"Nasty attitude Spanish lady who barely spoke English bathroom only for customers, hello I'm on the line ready to order",0
They tow your car. $430 to get it back.,0
The food is terrible. Coffee is terrible the atmosphere sketchy,0
"I ordered a lot of items, added and paid for extra sauces and they only gave me two sauces. What?? I asked for more and they refused to give me more and said 퐕ou cant have that much sauce?why?? I ordered 3 honey and 4 ranch and they wouldnt give it to me! Why cant i have sauce?? I cant eat dry ",0
"For the love of business, update your hours. This location has not been open 24 hours in two and a half years. It's super easy. Just call Google.",0
"It's dark. It's dirty. Carry your own napkins cuz they only give you 1 or 2. Everytime I've gone, the tables have been filthy, so have something to wipe them down. The food is always good though.",0
"Absolutely terrible customer service.  Their self- ordering kiosks don't work. I scanned my DEAL, the kiosk directed me to order at counter where the manager insisted the coupon had EXPIRED because I scanned at Kiosk first. He said he could not override the problem which is what a manager is for. Very disappointed.  Do NOT recommend this location. Bad service",0
fckking cleaning woman didn't let me use bathroom mthersuck,0
"Probably the worst McDonalds I've ever had. Nasty burger/cheese/bread consistency, dirty place and rude service screaming at each other and not even looking at you while trying to be nice and understanding to them.",0
"Terrible, kids from high school smoking inside restaurant!!",0
Manager called me out for seating and eating my food at 11pm. There were some seats available. Closes at 2am. If they don't want folks to sit they need to robe off all seats. Manager allowed me to eat.,0
Close not 24 hours.. don't know what time they close but not 24 hours,0
"Bought a coffee and after needed to use the restroom. Manager impatiently said no when I asked to use theres, then when I asked if they knew any nearby bathrooms he shrugged and turned around walking away. I get the bathroom is closed, but how about being prepared to help in a somewhat friendly way.",0
"Waited for 30 mints after ordering, like a joke",0
Terrible customer service (every single time I go there),0
"Not terribly clean. Stopped in and decided to buy snacks here as we also needed a restroom. Sign was placed on the restroom marking it closed just after we received our order. Coffee drink my husband ordered was certainly not coffee, perhaps a milky product and lots of ice?",0
"This location tends to vary in quality.  If it's raining, I would recommend you not go since they close the upstairs and the seating becomes scarce due to the campers taking up the front of the store. When it's nice out it isn't much better though since the place is very dark and feels damp. I how's think they are trying to help people not eat their food since it is a very unappetizing place to eat.",0
"I want there today and order a small fries and a chess burger, the order came very fast but the cashier was with another customer she was taking order after she finish with customer she didn't even wash her hand or  sanitized her hand or she used glove she want and start putting fires and giving it to customer. I didn't even eat my fires . its Covid time be careful.",0
"I ordered my food online got everything perfect. When I went to pick up my food I asked if they can show me which toys they had today because i wanted to collect all of they toys for my daughter. They looked at me like i had 3 heads and said, we dont have toys. I replied, no toys in a McDonald's? Thats a shame. They tell me they only have the old ones. So i ask another worker who was extremely rude, and ignored me the whole time. She then says give me 1 minute while having her back turned so I didnt hear it especially with these masks on. I wait a little and see her making little effort to help me as if i was asking for something not worth their time. So I ask another employee and she points at the other employee saying ask her. All I wanted was a toy for my daughter. Those employees need to get out of there if they dont want to work there.",0
"Closed at 5am at a ""24 hour"" McDonald's??

And now a week later cash only just like the chamber's st location... you kill postmates",0
Its sunday and its says open at 6:30am people are waiting outside they said they need another 10 minutes while one of the staff smokes at door. Wake up earlier so you can start on time people!,0
Worst employees ever! Had to wait for 20 min and they pretend like didn even know that they have my ,0
"2 different visits: The supervisor in the grey shirt was the one give out the food with an attitude like he didnt want to be bothered. And I ordered 4 apple pies at night and all of them were old, dried out, and their box had no sell by time stamped so who knows how long they been in that warmer. Probably will place my food orders elsewhere",0
"Absolutely unprofessional staff, disorganized, and angry. They were so angry and SCREAMING out the numbers into a girl's face angrily. They were talking about jumping a girl. And when I went to order I took a second to take my phone out to show her the deal I wanted and she snapped at me and said HELLO and repeated my order and said OKAY?! I said yeah but I have a deal I want to use. She waved it off and said ""it don't work"". She was snapping her fingers and voice. I literally just got there and she was just already angry standing there. I took my card out to use and she said ""You have cash? That don't work!"" As if I knew. She didn't state it beforehand. What I didn't understand was everyone else before me ordered with a card? So I just told her I don't have cash and walked off the line. I saw people using their cards and when I saw that I got upset. I just got done working a long day and I was tired and hungry and just wanted my McChicken and fries. I got back on line and there was her friend. The friend told me to insert my card. I asked her if it works she said yeah. I said so WHY did the other lady tell me otherwise? Then the lady saw me on line again she said ""I just told her the app don't work why is she asking again?!"" I said ""Actually, you also said the card reader doesn't work and it does so I wouldn't know what's true or not?"" She said ""WHO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE TALKING TO?!"" ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE SERVICE. They both started laughing. There was a pretty big spider walking around on the floor too. All the tables were dirty. And the guy cleaning was on his phone and rapping. And looking at other customers butts. She handed me the food harshly. They're all children. Immature children. Absolutely disrespectful.",0
Bunch of bums working here,0
My nuggets not only had a random piece of lettuce on top but bits of paper at the bottom of the box. Not cool. There wasn,0
Staff makes everyone use the touch screen that everyone else touches. Do you even have cashiers anymore?,0
"They were cleaning surfaces while simultaneously serving food off them- and i dont mean they were drying, there was water sloshing. And bizarrely, my 10 piece mcnugget order was ready and bagged up on the counter before I even paid. I ordered at a kiosk, so no one overheard my order and acted fast... I got to the train station a block away and opened my food to find that my food was soggy and slightly brownish. Dont eat here at night.",0
Which 24 hours is this place open?,0
"The service was slow, there were 4 people ahead if me and only 1 cashier.  Then it looks like the manager or supervisor opened up.  They didn't have Sprite, or Hi-C orange.  Some guy in a black tank top got up from the table and walked to the back where they were preparing food. Now I realized it was an employee, not in uniform.  Bathroom was out of order and every table that I went to was dirty.  It's been a while since I've eaten in there, it looks like new management??  I'm concerned.",0
"Terrible place filled with druggies and bums, there even a security guard who has to be standing there making sure everyone safe or kicking people out. The seats are ripped and extremely filthy I could imagine bugs b",0
"Customer service is very poor. For the frosty, they added the toppings on top of regular soft serve and didn't even bother mixing in. And when I asked for ketchup for the fries, they handed me the ketchup box for me to grab some ketchup packets.",0
"Good luck getting service. I tried to order at the counter instead of the kiosk, and stood there as 3 people directly on the other side of the counter ignored me for ages. I could understand if it was busy, but I was the only person there! I finally gave up and went to Shake Shack.",0
The worst one in the city. Finger indentations in my squashed triple cheeseburger gross! Cold and disgusting tasting too.,0
"The 1st issue with this McDonald's location was at 7pm they don't have sweet tea.  Secondly, the water for a hot tea was luke warm, at best, then when asked, ""Is this the hottest this water can get?""  With a response of yes.  This is at 7pm.  McDonald's food quality has dipped since this pandemic and I suppose it's because if it.  Boooo.",0
Staff Super Ghetto,0
"Lousy dirty dangerous place. Full of junkies, crackheads and homeless people. This place should have an armed security guard to keep it safe and clean.  Do not bring children here. Do not step foot in here. Worst I have ever seen.

There is one bathroom that locks and it filthy",0
"I ordered an M&M McFlurry and paid. Then they handed me an Oreo McFlurry and said they were out of M&Ms. That is not what I ordered so it was very disappointing and annoying, but since I'd already paid there was nothing I could do but keep the Oreo. Then when I asked for my receipt because I didn't want them to leave my credit card info on the counter they started explaining that they're out of M&Ms--a concept I understood even though I was annoyed about it.
Also, the bathroom is gross and the top floor is never open.",0
"Every franchise I have been to in NYC has been very disappointing. Most team members, not all, loathe their job. Furthermore I can never reliably tell if McDonald is 24hrs anymore because of the inevitable ",0
The night supervisor in grey is very rude. Although it says 24/7 they often close around 1 am.  Unless you order uber eats u are not able to come in and place your order.,0
They moved fast but it wasnt very crowded. The food wasnt that good it was no salt on the fries and my burger was extrs salty. Then they gave me orange soda because they didnt have strawberry fanta but thats def not what i wanted. If im ever in the area i wont be coming back here.,0
Really rude cashiers. Bathroom was broken. Awful hot chocolate.,0
DON폯 order through uber eats they forget to give you the sauces,0
The cashiers seem to have no idea what is going on. Mess up orders. Literally give small portions. Ordered a sandwich and they gave me one of smallest chicken that i've seen. I wouldn't recommend this place. Find a better McDonalds around.,0
"12:43 am on a Sunday. They were closed. 24 hours is not accurate, please update the hours. -signed, heartbroken and hungry",0
I dont like MacDonalds in NY.  Has a horrible attendance and this thing of asking to open the bathroom to be able to use is not pleasant. On one occasion my niece went to make the request for all and the security said that if we were not going to buy nothing was to vacate the table.,0
This is the worst McDonald's in New York City. The heroin users congregate at the main table in front of the register and they harass customers as they come in. They nod off and just buy a soda or water to occupy the table for hours. There's homeless in front of the McDonald's and to the side and inside there's a lot of shady individuals that are just sitting there coming down off heroin highs. The service is mediocre and the atmosphere is gross. For it to be across the street from NYU this should be a whole nother level of security and quality.,0
"Absolutely horrid customer service; and even though I have lower expectations for a McDonald's in food quality, this has particularly bare food taste and is often served sloppily. Eye contact is optional in their employee training, apparently.",0
"They have a security guard who has the key of the restroom and he thinks he owns it he got upset because I was holding the door for my friend to use it cuz he was waiting too as I did ,the security guard doesn't come until 7 am so if you buy something before that you are not able to use the restroom until he comes ,the bathroom doesn't look from inside means that anybody can open the restroom while you still using it, he also was arresting us cuz my friend took a little bit longer in the restroom and he ask me if my friend smokes I think that unprofessional!",0
"Food was the bog standard, biggest issues here are:
1. The cheeseburger I ordered had a hard bun.
2. Service was terribe there should be lines or devides to clearly mark queing lanes rather than someone shouting ""There are three lines"" and there be nobody serving in the other 2.
3. They messed up my order (seems to be the case in every McDonald's in NYC they seem to miss out 2 of the things on my order, that being fries or drink.)
Wouldn't recomend.",0
"took ten minutes to convince the staff to let me use the bathroom even after purchasing a full meal, because omeone was in there",0
Customer service is horrible! Its law U cant reject TLC driver to use restroom! Keep closed your one star toilet! U dont deserve uber ride at all!,0
"REALLY BAD SERVICE.
The people working there throw your food, the hamburger wasn even well done and gave me the wrong drink. Their service is just TERRIBLE! ",0
Not open 24 hours. Workers shut the store at around midnight if there,0
"Was cursed out by the employee that was mopping (in Spanish), thinking I couldn't understand, which I could. And then the staff just giggled. McDonald's, hire people that actually read the requirements to treat their customers in a respectful way.

Thanks.",0
Why did I ever think think that McDonald's had anything good for cheap. The best thing is their overpriced fries. The burger mouth feel was like tofu. I hope millennials kill ol' McDonald with their healthy spending habits.,0
"Typical McDonald's experience. Long lines. Long wait (considering what you're getting). Rude, ghetto employees. Equally rude and ghetto patrons. Just there for a cheap ""quick"" snack or meal.",0
"It's a place you can't stay for more than 30 mins even though you buy its food. It's better to just close this McDonald, so that the manager will not worry about the time anymore.",0
"No restrooms, no seats to eat, no stars",0
Check your bill after order we've got 'extras' for 2$ we didnt order and while we were waiting they did same for other customer. And btw restrooms are disaster.,0
"I ordered hot chocolate on machine and when I went to the pickup they told me it was sold out...
And the floor is really dirty. Clearly this restaurant is out of management.",0
Mac chicken price is $1+ Tex I ordered 2. But they charge me $5.88. Also they gave me wrong serial number almost 30 minutes I waited. Really suck....,0
"This is by far the worse Mac's anywhere in the world I have been in,and I have been in a lot.Some of the seats are worn out and need replacing.The toilet was closed down and the security is sending people to a nearby pizza shop.",0
This place is not open 24/7. Please adjust your expectations accordingly,0
"My order was wrong, nothing was right about it. I'll never go there again",0
"the customer service is terrible, they speak very badly to the clients",0
The food was ok but the staff were just rude and have no idea of what customers are. The security guard was a good man tho.,0
Cold nuggets cold fries slow service chaotic. Dinning room not clean. Server unfriendly to patrons who were not her color,0
The slowest service I have ever experienced. Even after ordering online I wait for far to long for pick up.,0
"Very upset about my ice caramel macchiato.  Why so much caramel syrup??   Enough to make another two drinks, ruin it.  Threw it out smh",0
This MCD need a serious improvement.  The fast food is extremely slow + their ordering in line is horrible.   You end up waiting over 5 min to place an order then 10 min to get it.   #HORRIBLE,0
"Machines where broke ,they messed up my order , there was no real management here at this location it needs alot of work !!!",0
"There is a very obvious sign in the top window that says they're open 24 hours. Upon entering, an employee claimed that they were closed. After asking about the 24 hour sign, I was given attitude and told again rudely ""We're closed""",0
"Very horrible! , disrespectful employees, never answer phone calls . Completely awful. Ive been to many McDonald's and this been the worst .",0

Not 24 hours! Closed at 1:30 am !,0
"Bad experience. Manager took a break and the toilett key with him, so, no toilett service for hours.
Jan 24, 2019 6pm",0
Lines are usually quite long and don't move very fast. If you need a quick meal go across the street to Fresh & Co.,0
Horrible service . Manager try to Force me to use a dirty computer to order my food .,0
"Absolutely worse McDonalds I've ever been at. Service horrible, workers very bad appearance and just standing around not doing anything. Bathroom broken. Just bad!",0
Not a great experience to be honest. They messed up my coffee order and the bathrooms are pretty bad.,0
I personally don't like fast food but McDonald's is a mainstay. NYC has much more to offer than that as a food choice.,0
Every employee standing around texting and talking. Got my order completely wrong. Filthy lobby. Just really no redeeming qualities here.,0
"Unfriendly employees who don't really care for people, they there to collect their paychecks that's it. Acting like robots",0
Restaurant is aged.  Chairs mostly torn.  Ice Tea is as sweet as syrup.,0
Never open 24 hours. Always closes around 2 AM. They really need to change the hours online.,0
Stopped in for an ice coffee and regretted it immediately.  The place was a mess from the garbage cans to spilled beverages near the registers.,0
insane staff.,0
Closed when it says 24/7 on Google Maps,0
Worse McDonald's I've  had so far food tastes and looks like it was  made hours ago not made when ordered,0
"Numerous people screaming at each other and almost getting physical, dirty tables, vandalized seats. Absolutely unacceptable and dangerous!",0
Wendys is better but this place satisfies the munchies. Watch out for the dopeheads and crack fiends looking to score!,0
"Took mad long getting my m&m McFlurry, missed my X27 express bus the last one of the night, all because they didn",0
It's a crack house that sells McDonald's. Everyday. All day. But NYU is just a few licks away smh,0
Not so safe but good worker's,0
If I could rate this place a 0 I would. No smoothies or drinks of that sort both times I went. WORST customer service I've ever encountered. Avoid this place.,0
"Employees they just play a lot of,talk a lot of and they work properly",0
"It's always smelling weird, not talking about the food. The bathroom can be gross at times!!",0
"Not friendly, tables were dirty, they were out of some  of the sandwiches",0
"Says open 24 hrs, however says only uber is allowed to make orders.",0
"Its NY but come on, you can't clean the restroom. Also, getting the key to use it is a hassle.",0
The worst one ever... So rude staff. Dirty floor... Won't come back.,0
Poor customer service. Needs better management and SECURITY.,0
It was the worst experience it sucked I got home and everything was wrong,0
Very slow service at this McDonald's and the tables weren't clean at all! The floors were sticky too!,0
"Very dirty
Table never cleaned
Restroom out of order
Do not forget to bring your maid with you if you need clean table",0
Food is never hot and fresh,0

Service not pleasant
Drink not good and I asked to change it and I was told ok but you pay when the ice tea had no taste at all
extremely disappointed",0
"A very degraded place, and the staff is not friendly",0
"Two giant women who stay at the early hours refused me service just because the order was large. They invented that cards weren't working, but a customer had recently passed a card. Both lazy and aggressive behavior. A fat white woman and a black woman. At 5 am there are almost no stores open, I had to get hungry. Never again will I go to this place! I don't know how the franchise owner allows this type of employee on site.",0
The order was simply forgotten. We only received it after asking.,0
"Table not clean, no toilets... Staff hardly friendly, except the security guard... you have to be hungry",0
"Below-average Mcces, especially in terms of cleanliness, but also the friendliness of the staff. You know that from Germany much more professional, cleaner and above all friendlier. I like McDonald's, but we won't be going back here. What was good: there was enough space and on the upper floor you can also look",0
"Small food, there is nowhere to sit, the taste of the food is regular and they literally take you out and restrict the counters to eat when they are still taking orders at night.",0
"I rate it as good! Nice physical space, service too. But unfortunately the place only had 1 bathroom. Men, women, children and the disabled. 1 toilet. 1 sink. 1 changer. Oh you can imagine!",0
"It looks like a market place, the security of the bathroom lacks class, he is a very shocking person, rude",0
"The person who cleans is completely dirty, poorly dressed and smells bad. Besides, he started yelling at us for sitting for 5 minutes to choose the menu, he even threatened to call the police, he literally ran us out of there, the moment I went to place my order the cashier treated us very badly, I do not recommend it to anyone, the worst McDonald's in New York.

The food is bad and the service so good,0
Terrible the place you could not sit down as an excuse the pandemic not recommended to go to this mc establishment,0
Terrible service I do not recommend coming to this mc donalds bad sellers,0
Dirty place and long wait. The food is different than in Italy,0
"Not clean, no ketchup and mayonnaise, the toilets are closed. Not tasty",0
The filth of the bathrooms is impressive. It is not possible to think that an internationally renowned chain maintains the bathrooms in that state.,0

"Order took longer than usual, and was missing a McChicken the first time.  Had to wait a long time after that to get another one.

Picture shows how beautifully it was made.

I was also given few napkins, and had to ask an employee for more.

There was a couple of homeless people that wandered in the restaurant that made me leave early.

Would give 0 stars if I could.",0
"I bought a tea today March 13,2023 at 7am and I asked for cream on the side. When I poured the creamer in the tea was expired. Please see attached photo.

I also bought food. 2 3$ bundles and everything was cold. I tried calling and no one picked up the phone.",0
"I got a sundae and My sundae got knocked over when I went to sit down , I asked the manager in the picture below for a new shake and he said it no refills. So I퐉 explaining to him that I퐉 not getting a refill my sundae fell at the table and he keeps yelling 퐎ead the sign ? I tried giving him the sundae  back i",0
"I asked for a refund for poorly made oatmeal. The worker got upset with me asking for a refund and threw my money all over the counter and told me to ""have a good life"". My oatmeal was literally only hot water. Then the worker stared me down very hostile as i left the store.",0
"Ordered on the machine because the workers were too busy talking.  Pay by card at the machine and no receipt comes out.  I tell the worker I didn't get a receipt and he says ""don't worry we will bring it out."" I dutifully sit down with my table number with my family and wait. I really wanted my receipt, and, as you can imagine, this will be important later.

So we sit around for a while, I go and ask for ketchup, cream, and sugar.  Get like 4 ketchup packs for 4 people's orders.  Ketchup poor I make my way back to my disappointed family and dole out one ketchup each.

More waiting, finally I go up with my table number and ask about the order.  The same worker looks at me and says ""do you have a receipt?"" My pocket-version of Kafka bursts into flames and I can only laugh at the absurdity.  I finally get the attention of the manager who manages to pull my order from the void of the machine.

Why two stars? Because when the g
Food came the bread was good, it tasted ""fresher"" than other recent McDonalds forays and  from the time they pulled the order to when we got the food was pretty quick.",0
All I needed was an iced tea - it took over 7 mins. They wanted people to use the kiosk I guess. I decided I just won't go back.,0
"Drive through hours say open till midnight. Just drove through at 11:11 and even though several workers clearly seen inside, they said they were closed.",0
"Avoid at all cost, they always pull you forward even if you got a simple order. Rude staff do not come here",0
"Slow slow slow, decided to try curbside because my last 2 experiences were really slow through a couple other McDonald's drive thru lines but this was worse....waited 30 mins for 7 hot chocolates and watched 3 times the amount of cars go through the drive thru while i waited....poor service, I even had a guy come out and tell me it would be soon about half way through waiting but still nothing. Finally brought them out and they were just warm milk no chocolate. By gar the worst experience I've ever had, just asked for a refund and left...",0
"One of the worst McDonalds I've ever been to in the world! 1 person works here!! No cashier, no one in the kitchen, 1 person at drive through!! Totally unacceptable!",0
"I ordered 2 milkshakes. They just left one of them at their prep area almost 10 min. After 15 minutes past I got one melted milkshake (look like creamy milk) that my kid refused to take it. After left there, I drove back and asked them to make a new one.",0
"Something has really changed at this McDs.  Went at 7:30pm on 8/19.  Line of cars not moving for ages.  Then finally moves and I had to get their attention at the drive thru order area.  So many people there, the food should have been hot and fresh.  Burger and fries were stone cold.  The crew seemed to be focussed on other things.",0
"Everytime we go through the drive through here something gets missed.  The caramel flavoring is missing from my latte today. Fruit Fly is the OJ. No syrup in the sprite. Missing order items. There is always something.
I realize it's a busy place but some attention to detail is needed.",0
"Ask for King Pin. We order the regular/not spicy chicken nuggets. We did not see the difference in price. I asked at the window and the guy was really rude. When I asked for his name he said ""You can call me King Pin"". If he had just said the regular nuggets were two dollars more, it would have been fine. HE WAS ABSOLUTELY THE RUDEST PERSON I have dealt with in a long time",0
"This might be one of my least enjoyable  McDonald's locations. Food orders are wrong, bad parking, slow service, entitled employees. I would go out of my way to NOT go here.",0
"First of all, I can't understand why they had such a poor design with parking. Parking is hard to get into and the shopping center has such a big parking lot. It's such poor design. Then they take a while for dine-in. It's faster if you order on the kiosk or app instead of waiting for them to take your order.",0
Not very convenient if you just want to dine inside there's very little parking and difficult to get to other than that the food is the same.,0
I had to go around the drive through 3 times to get everything that I ordered. Though people where usually very nice and apologetic.,0
This is scandalous I came to this location and it was closing one of the employees went running to put some cones on drive Thru to make it seem they are close. It was 11:00 pm still one more hour until they close .,0
"This Balboa McDonald is one of the worst in town. I don know why I keep going back. Well not anymore. Today mess up after a long slow line and being asked to pull up and wait, I got home and was missing 2 cheeseburgers . Clearly on my",0
They don't clean their soda fountains or ice machine.   Not to mention how slow they are at taking orders when walking in.,0
"I ordered a Sprite and waited for my receipt and watched the girl throw it away as I waited. Ok. I drive through to pick up and am told that Sprite is out.

My issue is that no one knew. Not when I placed my order or when I went to pay. Even the guy at the 2nd window didn't know until he tried to get my drink.

So I ask for my money back. The guy asked me for my receipt. For a dollar in the drive thru. I told him the lady didn't give me one. He takes a few minutes and then asks me to pull forward.

""For a dollar?"" I reply. Bc really this is ridiculous. The last time I pulled forward no one ever came! Plus the guy didn't even confirm what I am waiting for - a manager or my dollar?

I finally got my dollar tho.",0
"Very small McDonald's. There is like 3 tables inside and 2 outside. It gets crazy busy during lunchtime so expect your order to take a while or be messed up. Also, parking is limited.",0
Can't take an order. I ordered 2 happy meals and they recorded one. At the pay window I corrected their mistake and paid for two. Then at the second window they only gave me one and insisted I only paid for one. They absolutely refused to give me 4 little nuggets and a couple of fries. This is the McDonald's closest to my house and I go there frequently. Well not anymore. I hope the $4.99 they stole from me with make up for the $40 I typically spend there weekly.,0
"My daughter and I stopped in for a quick bite about 3:30 on Saturday 14th. We were charged for something that should have been free. The young female supervisor or manager that had to take care of the refund was very rude and unapologetic for their mistake. The worst customer service I've had in that square in years.  Perhaps when they did the remodel they should have gotten rid of the terrible staff as well. Come on McDonald's you can do better than that. Please take some pride and have expectations for your employees serving your public. Terrible place, I truly hope they fire that supervisor, trust me she's not worth the money she's being paid.",0
Save your money I went there today and bought a big Mac when I got home there was no meat on it,0
"McDonalds Balboa. The one next to the gas station. Probably the only McDonalds in area that ignores customers at the front. I literally had to get agressive and ask for a Manager on duty to get some assistance. What really ticked me off was when a guy came in on a wheel chair and we were both patiently waiting for some assistance. Customer service definitely isn't a priority at this location. No ""Hi, welcome, we'll be right with you"". Nothing. When I told the woman there that they had customers, all I got was a ""I know"". Unprofessional, unapologetic, and uncaring staff and I think the woman may have been a supervisor/manager. Her shirt was different from the rest. Would rate this store a 0 if I could.",0
How do you go thru drive thru and they make you pull over to wait for you food in this heat and bring you the wrong order TWICE?!! And than when I take it to the manager she has a whole attitude and snatches the bag and remakes it with a whole attitude.,0
Worst large fries ever. DONT GO TO THIS ONE. ALL OF THEM WERE STALE AND UNSALTED AND COLD.  WAITED FOR 20 minutes with no line.,0
"I don usually do reviews but today, one of the worst service I퐒e ever received. As I pulled in the drive thru the girl working (Elizabeth)  it had a really bad attitude I honestly don know if she having a bad morning or something but she didn",0
"Gave this spot a second chance, Simple request no cheese said it three time to make sure. Girl at register confirmed the order but guess what they put cheese drove all the way home to be disappointed u guys are the worst.",0
"Today I went in and bought a happy meal for my 4 year old, they are advertising Toy story 4 toys which was the toys she had been asking for, we opened her happy meal at home just to find out she got a peter rabbit figure instead. ",0
"The only good thing McDonald's has is the Shamrock Shakes.  If they ever stop making these I will never go back.   I do wish they would put them back in the large drink cups.  It seems the prices keep getting higher, and the cups are getting smaller and smaller.  Very sad.",0
"We just tried to come through the drive thru it's 11:49 pm the car infront of us got to order , we pull up and the gentlemen tells us your closed ? I would understand if you didn't just take the order of the car infront of us. YOU CLOSE AT MIDNIGHT NOT 11:50 ! If your gonna close early and deny service,  deny service to everyone 10 minutes early !!",0
All sodas were completely flat! So I asked to pay the difference for an iced coffee.. I get a hot coffee then we get burgers with no meat!! It wasn,0
I hate this place I do people that work there they should pay more attention to there customers not cool at all people should not go but they do I guess they like the food or what really I don't really care at all,0
"Yeah, the food here is gross. First and last time here. The nuggets were brown--not golden brown, BROWN. The parfaits looked really unappealing. I'm thinking they were frozen and then sat in the sun and baked and then were put back in the fridge. Gross.

They had me park to wait for my order. I stepped outside of my car to make a bottle for my baby. The drive thru worker stuck her head out the window and yelled, ""Your parfaits are ready!""

 Do you have feet? You want me to walk",0
"Will probably update with a coveted three star review after I go eat some after work dinner SpaghettiOs and am not pissed. Apparently my kid and the employees both counted two less McDoubles than I paid for and, guess, guess what, seriously, four french fries instead of five. They stole my fries just like the last time I ordered fries for myself. So dad doesn't get his burgers or fries, cool. Or maybe I can drive a couple miles through rush hour traffic and complain about a location I've always had problems at to a person who doesn't care. Think pizza night needs to be more often!!! No wonder all these big fast food places are going out of business in Clairemont.",0
"There was a roach on the counter by the register. The cashier and several other employees saw it. They looked at me waiting for my reaction. I will never eat there again, since the last review stated there was a roach problem. They obviously haven't done anything about it . I will never eat there again. And I'm reporting them to the health department.",0
"Never good! Food was cold, fries were soggy! If I want with someone I wouldn't have even gone. I would give zero stars if I could",0
"No hashbrowns on their all day breakfast menu. No water dispenser like some McDonald's. Limited menu, slow service - counter was completely unstaffed for long periods of time while customers lined up.

Inferior McDonald's, keep driving.",0
"Horrible service, waited 10 minutes plus to get service, the ""Manager"" showed up and said she was busy she could not take my order",0
"I love McDonald's. But always something wrong with my order? This time, I didn't get a cheeseburger. Only the bun with cheese!",0
"The service is horrible! The workers don't wash there hard after taking the trash and the manager smokes mirjana before and after work hours,I came into the McDonald's and it spells like a stuck inside really disgusting!",0
Ordered mcnuggets with Hot Mustard sauce. Gave me Honey mustard sauce... And they flipping want $15 an hr?!?! Can't even get your order right!!!!,0
worst service I've ever had! I was standing there for 15 min for them to make me one drink and there was no one else in there. They were caught up in there own conversation and not helping me!,0
"Keiosk ordering for fast food is horrible, removes the people element of jobs. Service was very slow with this system, and I will not be a part of this again. It sucks",0
"These employees are sitting at a table with the doors locked and the store closed but its a ""24 hour"" McDonalds and its 12:47 and I'm pretty sure it shouldn't be locked and I should be full",0
"Limiting 5 happy meals per customers. Ridiculous!!!!! I have 6 childrens. ""SMH"" UNBELIEVABLE!!!!",0

HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE FOOD DRY NUGGETS NOT FRESH FRIES COLD PULLED UP AND WAITED 15 MINUTES FOR FRESH NUGGETS IM STILL IN LINE WAITING,0
"It was a little packed but cleared out quickly the upstairs was not crowded at all very surprised. My gripe is that my server preparing my coffee dropped my lid on the floor and lookroceeded to place it on the coffee and hand it to me. So I kindly but firmly asked, "" Didn't you just dropped that on the floor?"" She gave a look like, ""Oh I did, walked over to the garbage & dumped it. I should hve called the manager but she gave me no problem. Just wondering if she has a habit with other items dropping & giving it to customers占쏙",0
"The service of a terrible McDonald's is so bad that I can only call her that. I'm not racist, but when I meet this kind of executive manager, I think the executives of this company will come out to manage it and never go again.",0
the attention in this place is horrible.  the serving staff is really rude and unfriendly.  I do not recommend going to this branch of mc donald.  Your experience will be stressful,0
I came in at 10:30 on a Sunday and no dam breakfast.really? The only thing I want at 10:30 in the morning on a Sunday is an egg mc muffin. They had no pancakes. I only drink coffee and have breakfast at McDonald's and they didn't have acceptable breakfast products.,0
"I don't expect much when I visit a McDonald's, but this location certainly is one of the worst I've visited in the city.
The employees are incredibly rude, the failed to get either of my orders correct, and there seems to be a consistent encampment of homeless near the entrance that the staff don't seem to care about.",0
Poor quality and mediocre service.,0
This place smells HORRIBLE. I bought french fries with hot tea OMG couldn eat the french fries bec,0
"Woman staff blocked the bathroom and made us pay her to use the bathroom. When we asked her how much, she said, ""I don't know."" We were disgusted. Don't recommend coming here ever.",0
"Cold burger, without the customize order, served 7 minutes _after_ I've got the melting sundae.
Dirty mess upstairs.",0
"I honestly only went for a large French fry and to use the restroom. Very clean, great janitor. Pay her more.",0
"Very poor security at this location. It's impossible to go in without being harassed by people asking for money, and the staff don't even try to ask them to leave.",0
Woman behind counter very rude.,0
Bad service and their ATM machine is a fraud be aware of that. Has a chip in the card reader slot to scan your card and bank info.,0
"The food was fresh and hot. The service was quick and the restaurant was clean.  Maybe it's McDonald's policy, but why do you have to ask for ketchup, salt and pepper? And then there's none of that in the seating area either. I go upstairs, find a seat, take my food out of the bag, and no condiments! To get some, I'd have to pack my food up and go back downstairs for some frickin ketchup! No other fast food place is like that.",0
This place is the absolute pits. I have never experienced such poor management. The space can not hold the patrons. We were definitely at capacity and then some. They퐎e three floors and yet my dad and autistic daughter had to eat in the corner like slaves. You see my daughter is very routine so she is use to getting her happy meal and then sitting down to eat. At this location no one is,0
I entered to the restaurant and immediately a black guy with black clothes told me with a rude attitude that I need to buy something. I tell him that's ok then I start watching the Menu and 3 minutes later the same guy with a rude attitude again and raising his voice told me that if I do not buy anything right away I need to leave the building. By far the worst experience in a fast food at my Life.,0
"The food & service is excellent & if you are taking the food out it's great. However if you plan to stay & eat inside, there are many homeless people inside & the odors from the bathrooms dies not make it pleasant. Must clean up the odors inside if they want me back",0
Service sucks!!!! Customer service needs to definitely improve with the workers. Tables dirty I asked a worker to wipe the table off so my family and I could eat he told me No. Therefore I went and got napkins to clean the table while he stood around. First and last visit not to mention I'm a visitor from another state.,0
Disgusting and unclean. Do not visit.,0
Beware they are not 24 hours. I've stopped here several time in the early am hours and the door was locked. The workers were inside and wouldn't even come to the door. They yelled 6 oclock. So much for 24 hours. When it is open it surrounded by homeless people inside and out. They might as well turn it into a homeless shelter.,0
"Update: it's so frustrating to eat here! There is a virtual army of panhandlers from the nice guy who opens the door for you to the more aggressive ones that approach you as you order, or eat your food. In addition, the place is still disorganized and dirty.  That's McDonald's in New York.  Management at this location is pretty lame.",0
"I ordered a 6 piece chicken nuggets and when I get to my room I open the box to only find 4. They rip you off, check before you leave! Also, employees may follow you outside while saying insults towards you even if you patiently wait.",0
"The cashier successfully scammed my change. Well, I guess she needed the money. It is not about the meager change, but the idea that they would scam a paying customer. I will never come back here ever again, worst experience ever!",0
Awful place to visit in ugly new York City waste of time,0
They was so unpleasant at pickup,0
"Stopped here to get a quick bite, the place looks very dirty. Homeless people in the entrance and inside. The 2nd floor smelled like piss. Just go here if you want to go to the bathroom or are really really hungry!",0
this location has 3 floors but usually only 2 are accessible to customers. wouldn't recommend eating here and strongly suggest taking your order to go as the crowds of tourists and locals make it hard to find a seat.,0
"While the map said that this place is open 24 hours, we came to find the doors locked with a bunch of people casually hanging out/eating/drinking inside at 1am. The staff told us they're closed, even though they were not supposed to be.",0
The automated machine didn't print us a receipt so I told one of the employees who was nice enough to look up the number.  The problem was I had no reference to chek the order.  I spent almost 50 dollars for 3 kids and 2 adults.  I walked 5 blocks to get that food bbn order and when I got back to our job I discovered we were missing chicken nuggets and all the dipping sauces.  I ordered 6 sauces and we got none.  It really pisses me off because they always leave stuff out when we order large orders.  It's like they can only handle it if u have a simple meal.  It's so frustrating and plus it's like throwing 10.oo out the window..  you really need to be better about training your workers.,0
From a disabled stand point this would not be an ideal dining experience.  There isn't any designated areas for wheelchair customers. Staff are not equipped to handle a wheelchair customers. The one area where someone with a wheelchair chair could sit is next to the entrance the bathroom and the order kiscos and quite popular waiting area set up for customers waiting for their order.,0
"On May 6,2018 , I ordered my coffee by using online app at 6:30 am . I went to this location to pick up my order at 6:45 am , and then one employee at cashier who did not want to give me my order , because he didn see it on screen . I showed him see my online receipt include the number of order that I paid it by using my bank account . I asked him to help me to check on the system for make sure , but he did not want to help me . After waited for 5 mins, it showed off on the screen.",0
"I am not that pleased with, McD. The ice cream is nice. What I don't like about a lot fast food places; is that the ongoing clean up process is sometimes flat out disgusting. Who wants the crumbs from the table next to you; in your food, or getting dirty mop water inside your shoes, because they are mopping under the same table your trying to finish your meal?",0
"The service is slow.. 60/40 if the food taste good. And anything more then the 1,2,3 dollar menu the taste aint worth the price.. I think being extremely slow is a all McDonald's requirement tho.",0
"No tissues what so ever, not clean...lot of tourists from chinatown tour travel. It is simply shame on McDonalds to do these 3rd class services...confused and disconnected staff. Felt like there was only one person working who looked like a team leader...all employees making team leader work..pity on him.",0
"I've worked in the neighborhood for decades and this was always a decent go to place for a late night snack.

A couple of years ago they modified the interior- they removed a lot of seats on the main floor in order to install electronic order kiosks.  There are now only a handful of places to sit in a ridiculously cramped manner.  Late at night they close the upstairs- leaving pretty much nowhere decent to sit and eat.  Tonight I saw two people eating over the garbage cans and one eating by the soda dispenser.

The kiosks are annoying.  They ask if you want to take out or eat there.  If you select ""Eat In"", before you can pay for your order you're asked to get a table marker and enter the marker number.  Thing is there are absolutely no table markers- you cannot complete your order without one- unless you start over and select ""take out"".

During the day perhaps eating in makes sense- but late at night it's really only for take out.",0
"THERE'S NO CODE FOR THE BATHROOM! Just walk up to the second floor.

Horrible customer service, rudest people ever.",0
It's hard to give them any stars because we didnt get to eat there. For what is advertised as open 24 hrs they were closed all 3 x I tried to go there this weekend.  Very dissatisfied,0
"This place is more of a homeless shelter than a fast food restaurant. There is an upstairs seating area, which apparently only opens when the employees deem necessary. There is literally nowhere to sit here. Take- out only.",0
I was forced to buy something just because I had to use the restroom. SMH I understand that some business do that but really . No thank you plus manager was rushing everyone.,0
This garbage for 3.91 imagine,0
"The worst McDonalds ever in the world.Having already spended 12 dollars in coffees i was waiting for a friend for food.The manager insulted me and told me to go outside because i wasnt consuming .My friend came at that time so he made us the favour to let us eat there.
We spended 50 more dollars and after 1 hour he told us to go out again because you can eat only 30 minutes.The whole time the shop was half empty....At the next table a guy was eating duck from home having only a coka cola and no one told him anything.....DONT GO THERE",0
"It's clean...but they don't have fountain drinks, only bottles which is a ripoff. I don't like this one.",0
"Never gave me the drinks I ordered. Gave me the wrong ones and never bothered to rectify my complaint. Very disorganized. The woman who I complained to was very bad mannered, didn't have good customer service skills.",0
"when I was here it was during a rainstorm and the inside was very wet and dirty. It was also very crowded, as a lot of tourists and other people come here to try to use the bathroom for free. It was impossible to find a place to sit to eat my snack.",0
I gave this a one star just because it doesnt have zero star not sure how this place have a 3 star i will never step in there again the most nasty place ever first time going to china town and had to really used the br but also wanted food thank god i used the rest room first that place looked like hasn't been cleaned in years i bet rats leaves there after that i cant picture how their food is not sure how this is still open. People before you order dnt look at the Br yall will regret eating,0
"Place used to be great. Now they have beggars & the homeless have taken over almost the entire 2nd floor. Place smells horrid. The employees are rude, food takes so long.",0
Very bad service even when it's slow. The machines never work.,0
Food is not as great as it used to. Fries too bland. Burgers taste dry. Only giving it 2 stars because of their happy meal toys.,0
System always seems to be down frequently. Only accepts cash when their wifi is out.,0
"Do not eat from here...if you do shame on you...but take it home...dont even eat inside this mcdonald
Ive never seen a mcdonald homelesa shelter that's right i said it..how can you eat if there's homeless people camping out upstairs in the dining area like its their home ? And btw it reeks of piss upstairs too...",0
"It's a sad state of affairs when you buy an ice cream sundae to get access to the McDonalds bathroom and not only is the sundae prepared wrong (the hot fudge isn't supposed to just get dumped on top of the ice cream; that's gotta be, like, day 1 of McDonalds training...), but the bathroom clearly hasn't been cleaned in weeks.",0
"Small, crowded with inefficient system with limited seating. Messed up a simple order. Had to wait to get napkins and ketchup since it's at front counter only.",0
All Employee not polite and they not speaking English so rude to costumer. Manager and gm are not help for costumer,0
"Popped in for a drink to pass some time between appointments and charge my phone. Nothing works and homeless people were skattered everywhere, eating ketchup packets. Pass.",0
Canal Street McDonalds is a must to avoid!  Homeless people are here at all hours harassing paying customers and aggressively bumming people for change.  The Bathrooms smell like the last rose of summer.  Have your next breakfast/lunch anywhere but here folks!!,0
"Says it 24hrs, but showed up at 5:50am and they were ",0
If it's busy you will wait ages. Poor food at high prices. Plenty of better places to eat nearby,0
It's just convenient and cheap if you on the run,0
"Where's the beef , was on my break and didn't know what  to get so I got a big Mac I crave about once a year so surprised to see how small the party is now for a moment I thought there was no meat it so small that the lettuce was hidding it and it just didnt have that big Mac tast.",0
No seats in any of the floors. Too many people sleeping over the tables. I just wanted to eat in peace.,0
atendant was very nasty to me all because i asked her if they had ice i though there machine was broken.because dhe was asking another customer was the soda cold enuff.so i asked if they had ice and she replied very nasty.,0
"Food order took over 20 mins. Nuggets were dried out and old. To top it all all, no sauce or ketchup given. They did refill my drink because I waited so long.",0
Went here and got a quarter pounder and it was red in the middle said not to be a pain but can i get another burger get the other burger and the guy threw it in the grease trap  to cook it  horrible  i couldnt eat it   will not be going here again,0
"Extremely slow due to the lack of staff, expensive compare to those around the city! Don't recommend.",0
"so I called them up and was going to order when all of a sudden I hear ""SHUT UP!"" into the phone several times. Then I tried calling them up again to tell them what had happened, and they hung up not even caring.",0
"I came in to place an order for a number 2 meal tonight, and the cashier spoke very rude to me; called me ""papi"". I was really offended by her tone. Frankly, I will never dine at this establishment.",0
This place is awful. All workers had a attitude and the food made my 5 year old cousin throw up 5 times and my friends & I stomach her & caused both of to have diarrhea,0
Needs more security. Fight almost broke out between a homeless man and a patron.,0
Insanely rude and terrible customer service,0
"Obviously food is the same everywhere, however this restaurant has a loitering problem from some of the local homeless. The toilets in this one was also quite dirty.",0
"It's a disgusting place, those bathrooms were overflowing... they dont take care of the place. Dont even want to guess what's going on in the kitchen!",0
Always super pack! Not worth the wait if you do come here. They also had my breakfast mc muffin burnt! I don't know what else I can say...,0
Poor service very bad place,0
"Expensive, crowded and slow service. The worst combo for a FAST food place",0
"Always incomplete order, when u order cream and equal with your order, they never give, and when u ask for it, they just ignore you",0
Extremely rude staff but don't think much of it the people seem to be totally exploited by their horrible Hong Kong boss. Pity!,0
Two stars are given to the star 폚arla?who made our visit experience acceptable due to her helpful behaviour and lovely personality. Food was good but the place is not recommended for anybody especially tourists because it is alway,0
"One of the ladies was very rude to three other customers. I get it, I퐒e worked those types of jobs and I understand it not easy to be in a good mood dealing with so many customers all day, often the same problem many times, and I get people have mood swings, but this was more than just rude, it was confrontational. Not gonna give one star because she was",0
"I don't know if I could give a start less than 1

The security of this establishment is a rude , non friendly , and a cruel person.

I felt completely unsafe with this person around me, he heckled me and acted as if seats were reserved in this establishment, he was singing and tapping his foot like a mad man.

It is safe to avoid this restaurant if you don't want to suffer a racist encounter. Deeply disappointed that an establishment like McDonalds would hire people like this guy",0
"Apparently people are not permitted to go to the washroom,  clean up, and reset prior to ordering.   I like my food hot and don't agree with this store policy.  The manager wouldn't acknowledge me beyond a smirk.  I asked for permission,  she said nothing but a worker from behind the counter restated the policy.  A quarter-mile away, my preferred sequence worked golden.  Literally,  a STUPID policy implemented by that store and manager.",0
Security was nice and open the door for my sister and I to enter. I got on the line to make a purchase and my sister went to use the bathroom. She informed me of a worker or manager sitting down harassing her for a receipt just to use the bathroom. All the workers are hard at work and this lady is sitting down asking for a receipt. If there a customer only restroom why not,0
"Most of the ordering machines were broken. There was only one cashier, so the line moved incredibly slow. They refused to refill my ice tea, even though the other drinks were refillable through the machine. Prices were expensive.",0
"We went there during NYE, just prior to the ball drop. The surprising thing was there was homeless folks inside the store walking and smoking next to us when we were preparing to eat. The homeless guy was even asking for food to someone next to us. It felt very much like a 3rd world country's experience. The tables were dirty as well - maybe they need to hire more people for cleaning in between customers. The French fries were cold as well, as if they were probably heated long time ago. Also, the store associates should provide a tray for customers who are going to be sitting/eating inside the store instead of paper packets for takeouts.",0
"Horrible customer service. Especially the managment, treat everyone as if they퐎e lower than them no consideration whatsoever. I퐒e been waiting 10 mi",0
"Horrible! People around food coughing! I got a refund, asap! I퐉 not getting sick for no one! How you giving out the food in the front coughing without covering your mouth? Cough just spreading. You can not make this up! Make it make sense! What sad is that people need to do better. If this was my business it is no way I would want anyone in my establishments like this. What the point of having a mask on if it is on your chin. Than you have the other woman, she had her mask on but she kept coughing every other minute. Sounding like she coughing up a lung. All I wa",0
Very rude security. I came to buy a coffee and use a restroom. I prefer to use a restroom first. They yelled at me and put a flash lighter directly in my face that I have to buy coffee first. But i don prefer to go to the restroom with coffee or leave it on the table and expecting that someone spit in it ,0
Manager/security gard working on 02/12  was extremely unpleasant and screamed at us. Store was dirty and a health hazard. Don't go there!,0
"This place is right next to New York penn station so expect a crowd and a long wait, use the kios it's must faster. The customers there tend to be loud and uninviting.",0
"Only 3 people working in back, all cashes are closed because they don't have enough people. You have to use the machine to order. Waited 35 mins for my Mcflurry. Managers should be ashamed that they didn't help these employees.",0
Its a place to run in & grab something quick to eat . As far as sitting in there its not ok the ppl they allow in there are mostly homeless,0
"I took my children and their friends here for a treat after shopping. We used ordering kiosk..food was promptly given to us. When we found seating ,it was right next to the McDonald's security. Security cursed up a storm around my children with great vulgarity.",0
"Dont think i would go here on my own, a lot of vagrants about. Not very clean, food was ok.",0
"Employees make many mistakes, and it's patrons that hang out there, many are addicts.",0
The place is a mess and they didn't have breakfast. They expect people to eat a McDouble with orange juice at 5 am.,0
"The male cashier was lazy and rude and tried to charge me the higher prices. The 2 hamburgers I ordered were cold , COLD . Worse, they did not contain the extra pickles I requested 3 times! Yes 3 x. The 2 Apple pies were not only cold ...but ,worse, had been clearly sitting out all day and were so over cooked,  I just  spit them out and into the garbage;  less than 1 bite.
The chicken sandwich was not hot either  and worse , it was waaaay overly smeared  with unhealthy  mayo which  I threw away so as to not suffer food poisoning. It was by far the worst fast food restaurant experience ever in my life and it cost me a whopping  9 dollars and 93 cents. I WANT A REFUND PLEASE.

FINALLY ,this crowded McDonald's  was the filthiest and dirtiest one I've ever been in.

So very very sad and disappointed.

Respectfully submitted,

Timothy Ernest.",0
I was there this morning 3 24 2023 6am. Trying to order a biscuit and hashbrown. Like every day today this lady lost her mind told me to use the big screen to order and get receipts. She was doing nothing but standing there she don't want to take my order and keep telling me use the screen and refuse to help me.i verbally confronted her .there I left without my breakfast. If people like her keep working for your well known establishment you loose and get defame your good name because people like her. Teach her some manners how to behave with people ho come to your restaurant to have good time. She act like I was a homeless person. I hope you can do something about this incident.  Have a good day.  But I will not have good day because I will continue thinking about  what happened this morning with me at your place.,0
Customer service wasn't good and there were big rats outside,0
A Disgusting place a bunch of crack heads inside fighting and yelling. I ordered a coffee and it was not drinkable.,0

McDonald's seems to be the meeting place for homeless and mentally ill people in NYC. I don't know why ?,0
The food was ok but I have experienced better service. They missed things... The tables were in bad condition and the floor was not cleaned since ages.,0
Very rude workers don't even let you go to the toilet.,0
This is one of the busiest stores in the city. You get everything here. Definitely not a good place to dine in. Lots of tourists and people constantly asking for money inside the restaurant. Avoid if possible,0
Apparently there a bouncer for,0
Disgusting just bought a burger with mold on it!,0
"I've been more than patient with this place. I understand this is a tough area to work because I work near this restaurant. At this point closing so early randomly is unacceptable. It's like you are gambling with the little time you have for break. And the site says 24 hours, and still no dining??? They have security, so dodging the seedy types should not be an issue here.",0
I have never seen such a disgraceful service in my life. workers are very rude. That woman at the cash register shouldn't be standing there. should get out of work. You can't treat customers like dogs. who are you ?,0

Despite the fact that it羲? front sign explicitly says 羲?pen 24/7羲? they unethically keep the doors tide shut from the inside, based on a made-up rule that you have to show proof of an order from your 羲羲 phone. Even if your phone is dead, in the middle of the night, and you羲?e starving, they still won羲? let you simply walk inside to order, like everyone else in America. This is place is bad for business. DON羲? bother.",0
Terrible experience.  Filthy.  No soda at all.  Staff could not have been ruder if they tried.,0
"Looked like it could have done with some more staff.

Dude handing out the food just marked random ones as gone even though he didn't announce the numbers.

We had to go ask for ours. It was just chilling there.

But it's McDonald's. If you're going, you're going to go regardless of the rating.",0
To many homelessness are in this franchise it is quite disgusting,0
"Security worker said we could not eat our food inside and was very disrespectful, started taking a video of us and making rude comments while doing so. Made us go outside during a severe thunderstorm after purchasing our food. No sign saying anything about no eating inside the restaurant. Guy just had a power trip and probably upset how his life sucks",0
very very dirty and broken tables and benches,0
A lot was out of stock and staff attitude is horrendously bad,0
It stank in this facility. How is food even served,0
"Horrible! Avoid this place at night.  Unsafe.  Panhandling at the counter and hooligans will take your food the second it is ready for pick up, they won't even call your number. Staff and security could care less.",0
DO NOT I REPEAT DO NO NOT GO THERE!!! ONE OF THE WORST MC IN THE CITY. EVERY MORNING THEY NEVER HAVE MOBILE OR REGISTERS ITS SUCH A INCONVENIENCE. LIKE WHY ARE YOU OPEN???????????????????,0
To crowded and not safe with homeless and drug addicts hanging out inside. The good was not the same as other establishments. Very disappointing with good and service. Last time going there.,0
Chances of being stuck by a hypodermic needle are pretty high at this location.  Restaurant is full with people you really wouldn't feel comfortable eating next too.,0
Supervisor is a mean person that every time she has a argument somebody get hurt is really incompetent and if I'm lying look for all there latest news. And you will find tha the first with her and a client and it end security harming people. I am so sorry to say this. I was a suing manager in McDonald's when I was younger and there are better ways to handle situations.,0
"""Payment Warning!"" The non-American foreigners who run this restaurant is the only McDonald's in United States that do not accept Discover Card for payment.",0
"The staff who work there have no manners whatsoever. I go there everyday on my break and when it's time to pickup my order it's just a ""here you go.""
I'm always polite and always say thank you even though no one ever says anything back.
At this point I'd rather talk to a robot than anyone who works there.
I'd probably get better service.",0
If I could give zero stars I would. This place is supposed to be open 24 hours but they tell you at midnight their closed and tie the doors shut with what looks like a sweater after you퐒e placed an order. T,0
Worst service I ever experienced. I ordered one thing but cashier decided to sell me double of what he thought was better. When I asked for my money back Angel the shift manager was very rude verbally and physically. I will never be going to that establishment again.,0
"They need to keep the restaurant clean,tables are dirty,chairs,are equally dirty,you homeless people walk in there bugging us customers.",0
"This is what I encountered when I came to this location today.  A trash bag wrapped around the door by the security guard to stop ppl from coming in.   So instead of a safe, warm location to order and pickup from, I had to wait on a very dangerous Avenue in NYC while they took their sweet time in making my order.  20 minutes to make breakfast and having to wait on a dangerous street is ABSOLUTELY APPALING",0
"They were careful about maintaining social distancing, an encouraging sign.  However, because of the nature of the area, and the poor getting poorer, and the homeless getting braver, several times while waiting on line to order and to pick up, seemingly homeless/desperate people came in begging, some pretending to order, some appeared to be casing the customers.  It was disturbing to say the least. On top of all of that, the meals I had ordered were cold and the french fries limp and cold. I would never go there again.",0

"This review is in 2 parts: 1st the dining area and bathroom and 2nd the behind the counter crew and food.
1st...this Mc Donald's seemed to have their own guidlines for COVID-19. And the guidlines they followed were NONE or ZERO. The place was VERY crowded.NO social distancing. NO one to monitor or count how many people were allowed in. it  did not feel or look clean or a safe environment ...good to  spread germs and viruses.
alot of people from the street who were not customers just hanging around using many tables and  shoulder to shoulder in the seats. people passed out in the chairs with masks pulled off. They had ONE dining room person who just could not keep up with the mess that they were leaving. The bathroom was a horror show: obviously people were washing and cleaning more than just their hands inside. was dirty.
2nd,..the saving grace of the restaurant was the cashier, the food expediter and the employees making the food. they were all very fast, pleasant, thanked me, and the food was hot, fresh and very good.

Dining area and bathroom: 0 (zero) stars

Behind the counter employees and food: 4 stars

Combined and average:  2 stars",0
Full of dropouts. Take care,0
"McDonald's is fast food not because it's good but a quick cup of coffee ok.
Don't expect much as far as food! The
worst thing really is the ordering and waiting to get what you ordered!! Worse McDonald's is 8th Ave 35st! Very bad staff! I asked for a straw I had dropped mine no no no I said I'll pay for it never got the straw lol! You will live eating the food get ready for
cold food! And nevermind an extra anything! Shame it was not bad but now",0

The McChicken had Mayo only on a far side and it was all over the wrapper and top of the bun.  Almost NONE was in the sandwich.  I ate it though, but it tasted funny.  The McDouble was ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.  The bread was stale and hard.  The meat was cold.  It was a 1 out of 10 burger.  It was that bad.  I couldn't eat it so I threw it away.  I wish I could get my money back.  McDonalds is a failure at this point.",0
I always come here to get something quick while I work. It drives me crazy when I forget to check my food before I leave the restaurant because when I get back to work the food is so old! It so sad that you have to check your food before you leave! I ordered 3 McChickens. They were so old and hard that I literally had to just eat the bread because I ,0
"This McDonalds location is HORRIBLE!!!! They work very slow during the night/morning hours, forcing customers to use the Kios machine and everyone don",0
Security was rude. Has an emergency to use Restroom. He said No unless u purchase something.  I explained I would get a coffee but I an Urgent need to twinkle.  He state not my problem! I purchased a coffee. Will Never patronize this business.,0
"This McDonald is straight up trash. The one on 34th and 7th is better. Went at a bad time cause it seems like their systems was down. Only the kiosk was working. Sad thing is I had asked the lady if they had ice cream. She asked the manager, manager said no. Next",0
"Terrible! Patties are so thin AND overcooked. I remember how McDonald's use to be,and how real the burger use to taste. Y'all sacrificed everything about the old school taste of McDonald's for,obviously a profit. Never again. My kids will never eat there.",0
The security guy was very rude. He was on his phone while I approached him and asked if it was possible to use the restroom. He was rude and said that I can use only with a purchase which I agreed to. I humbly asked if I can use the restroom first before I make the purchase and he raised his voice at me and said u keep asking me the same thing. No humanity.!!,0
"Dirty, sticky tables and floors. Crowded. Expect to wait a while for food ordered at kiosk and at the cashier. No table service here. Dark space. Lots of transients, though the guards do a good job of making sure people buy stuff.",0
"Staff member made a mistake which we didn realise until back at our hotel. Returned to pick-up the missing salad and drink - rude member of staff who ignored us so we went to the collect desk - that staff member ignored us too so we followed her - she told us to go to the other woman! We refused and requested she deal with us. We had no receipt just the ticket number - they had taken the receipt with the initial order! Eventually gave in and tried to give us the original drink (erm if we had been trying to con them, how would we know the drink was there just sat on the side going cold?). Anyway don",0
"It's a McDonald's. If you want you've eaten at one, you've eaten at them all.

However, this review is based solely on the location. 8th Avenue has a SERIOUS homeless problem, and the restaurant is always swarmed with them. If it were just that they were begging for change, I could forgive it. Unfortunately most of the people I've seen are out of their minds on whatever drugs and usually screaming and carrying on. They make me incredibly uneasy, to the point where I'm not comfortable eating here anymore. More than once, I've seen fights break out. Best to find another location.",0
"There is a hired male guard for the bathrooms to ensure only paying customers use it, which seems overkill and made me as a customer uncomfortable. The technology of coded locks satisfy this need for other businesses in the area. Bigger concern is that a guarded bathroom was still incredibly filthy. If you're paying someone to hang around the bathroom all day, maybe also pay someone to hang around the bathroom and clean it. There was a copious amount of a vomit like substance trailing out of one of the stalls that had been there for some time and one of the two stalls didn't lock. Not cool.",0
"I퐒e never left a review in my life but I had to for this location. The ecurity?guard on staff tonight in this location was horrible, to say the least. The lack in customer service and decency is appalling. I퐒e never walked into a business where the ecurity?guard is finding any issue he can to cause a scene and I퐒e never seen a ",0
"Overcharging customers with their uninformed prices, then management does aid to the issue with accommodating the customer with the stated price.",0
Our chicken biscuit sandwiches were awful the chicken was overcooked we couldn't eat it ended up throwing it in the garbage I wish I had took a picture of it,0
"It was dirty, homeless people hanging out inside asking for money,I offered a person $5 to buy a meal and was insulted,I guess money was for Drugs or beer",0
Cant use restroom  without paying,0
"Ok for quick pick ups. Not the best place to go for a semi decent eating. The place was crowded, the crowd a bit rough around the collar, and the staff appeared rushed. Have head better service same venue, different later in the day.",0
I had to give 2 star because I've been trying to call the phone number listed on the website multiple times and no one responded or go to voice mail with Verizon. I had few missing items that I wanted to report. The food came fast but I have had better food from McDonald's than from this location.,0
"Dirty, several people trying to sleep at tables, no vaccine check. We were desperate for food/drinks but believe this was where we contracted covid. Currently in quarantine on ship.",0
"Bad service. Couldn't find straws,  all the tables were dirty.  And went to wipe a table down and couldn't find napkins.",0
"Extremely busy when we visited at lunchtime, with queues at most of the automated order points, and hardly anywhere to sit once we had received our food - which was good - from the rather harassed looking staff.

Despite there being a clearly signposted No Loitering policy with a maximum 30 minutes to eat your meal, this did not seem to apply to the rather insalubrious clientele who were occupying most of the seats in the back part of the place. I hesitate to use the word ""restaurant"" to describe this outlet.

As it is almost opposite the Tick Tock Diner, which was really busy at breakfast time, we had planned to try this McDonald's for breakfast, but after today's experience, we'll give it a skip.",0
Very dirty place.,0
"This McDonalds restaurant was Ok. Neither more or less compared to my expectations. However, I find it on a negative side note the constant stream of homeless people entering the restaurant, causing somewhat of a commotion.

The service and the employees of the restaurant was helpful and fine.",0
Bum central avoid this one at all costs,0
"Terrible service, slow, understaffed, dirty place and food was raw",0
"The fries were too greasy and the bread was disgusting. Watch out for the homeless people! One of them gave me a wedgie while i was waiting in line for my food. thank you

From ~ BigMamaPimp",0
"They botched an order. Ordered spicy chicken sandwich and they gave me a dry one. no condiment. Compete with Chick-fil-A? Yeah right, can't even compete against popeyes",0
Horrible and very rude guard,0
Very dirty dicusting.. food was sloppy and taste awful... wired and very unpleasant view of costumers in there...the most ugliest McDonald's I've ever been to,0
Nasty. Gnats flying around the trash can. The trash bin was so full people started leaving trash by the drink station. Security talking on the phone. They need to pay attention to the dining area. I was highly dissatisfied,0
"I've loved the original McChicken since it was introduced in the 80's when I was a baby.
But getting that McChicken from midtown it was so bland and felt rushed.
I ate it of course but still it tasted bad compared to the original McChicken",0
"Do not go after 9pm. The store was trashed and dirty and staff moved liked they'd just smoked a spliff. Very slow and had to repeat my order, which was on 2 cups of coffee!! Try to avoid this place like the plague.",0
"For every good and helpful employee, there's a bad and rude one to accompany them. These employees seem to go out of their way to be as unhelpful and rude as possible. And they'll regularly give you sauce packets that are sticky, dirty, and half destroyed. It's honestly worth it to either go to the one in Penn Station or at 42nd street.",0
"Because the female security guard that works for you is very very nasty and very unprofessional.  She throws 90% of the people out for no reason.  She has told the workers behind the counter not to take my order and not to serve me. She has not yet been able to give anyone a reason as to why she is putting me out. Majority of the people who come there. She has done the same thing to. She was once the warden at rikers island,  but she was  caught in the big drug ring letting  the other correction officers bring in the  drugs so now she is working  in McDonald's.  She has threatened  me  and has been harnessing myself and at least 50 other people.  I have called the police and  they told me to call McDonald's corporate  number. Something has to be done about her. She has no right treating people like this",0
"Today date is 8/4/2019 , time 6:59 pm, just walked in to use the bathroom and was told by a security guy that I couldn use the bathroom unless I buy something. He had a key from the bathroom and was sitting right next to the bathroom. I said ok, and then looked for a manager. The manager had confirmed that you had to buy something to use a bathroom. But for me, she would do a favor by letting me t",0
Boy this placr was scary,0
"It's unfortunate that this location is the closet to me. The staff really sucks here. From the lack of smiling, hospitality, and there's absolutely no thank you at the end of paying for your meal and no apologies when they give you the wrong order, they just hastily take the next customer. Even the cleaning crew sucks. I asked to be let into the bathroom and he looked at me with a blank expression. There is NO diversity what so ever. Only Spanish speaking crew members....... what a shame.",0
"I wish I could give it a no star! My purse got robbed inside the store and I asked the manager if he can please show me for video evidence he approached me by saying No, ask those ladies raising his voice at me and walked away. How helpful was the manager...",0
"This place is not very clean. When I first walked in, I heard yelling from a waitress saying ?02, 302?and there were many insects in this ",0
"This place in particular is a complete mess. And that day I went in was a Saturday afternoon, it was FULL of drug addicts and they took over the place, I believe there's a Rehabilitation Center near by and that's the reason. But however, I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE, unless you order to take out.",0
"The meal was good but there were to many homeless people and beggars inside this McDonalds. The beggars where fairly aggressive, impertinent and well prepared for tourists. They wanted to push a brasilian woman next to my table to give them 20 $.  She wanted to give them 5 $, but they tried to argue with her for 15 minutes! It was more like threatening than arguing. I was so pissed of after this experience.... The food is great, but the management should take care about this situation and protect their guests, especially tourists.",0
"I was waiting in line with my six year old son who had to go to the bathroom.  The security guard was sitting down talking to a customer, I knocked on the door and realized there was no one inside. So I asked him to open the door. He told me that if I did not have attitude he could do it faster. Then he opened the door and said Black people always have attitudes. He proceeded to curse at. I went to talk to the manager who pretty much ignored me and continued cooking French fries. I called the corporate number. This was by far the worse experience I have ever had in a McDonald",0
"Security person didn't let me use the restroom without showing a receipt. I said ""the line is long, and I have to go man, I'd be buying something after I use the restroom, I promise"" he said no, so now I'm writing this from the pizzeria next door, after using the restroom, two slices and a juice.
Thinking of going here? Go nextdoor!",0
"I was disgusted and appolled by this mcdonalds i would suggest NEVER go here. Walked in to the staff and security guard having a loud conversation or arguement im not sure, but after hearing the ""N"" word 20 times and standing there not being greeted i left. I felt unsafe and the staff were truly ghetto and extremely irresponsible. 0 work ethic 0 respect. If your a tourist avoid this location ! ! ! !",0
"Hello, I  would have gave this McDonald's  a better review but.. They have a person or the store manager  on the floor  telling  people they have to sit and the back or leave.. these people are the homeless and IV drug users....FYI THEY PAYED FOR THEIR FOOD!!",0
Sad to say the only thing good r the workers..who work hard I only come for coffe ..but they serve u with a smile ..saddest part that this location. Is filled with homeless people ..more homeless then customers. .sorry to say...will I come bk yes cause I enjoy the coffee befir church ....,0
"Soooo slow!!!! Came here to try and get a quick burger before my train (20min for departure) and these guys suck! No sense of urgency. It's supposed to be fast food...nothing in this place is fast. Missed my train by 5min with me running to Penn the whole way from here. Garbage is the sum up for this location. If you're thinking about getting something quick before your travels, look elsewhere. You're better off going hungry than waiting for these lazy employees to do their job.",0
This place had garbage on the tables and floors. It looked like a section 8 soup kitchen in there. Understaffed with unprofessional delinquents. they have their street friends coming from behind the counter after hanging out in the kitchen while tons of people were waiting for their food.,0
"Ordered McNuggets through the electronic menu and they made me select sauces, but none were given in the order.  The nuggets were dry and overcooked, especially without any sauce.  They also took my receipt when I wanted to keep it, so overall a poor experience.",0
There was a constant beeping sound that none of the employees seem to care. The tables were greasy with fries everywhere. At least the food was made fast. But I still recommend using another McDonald's.,0
One of the most disgusting places i have ever been too in the world. And i live in NYC!! In the early morning hours the place is full of herion addics doing drugs or just laying on their booths all high. They put my coffee in the microwave when i asked for it to be hot. Meaning it was probably from the night before.   I donot recommend this place unless you are a junkie.,0
"This one of the worst environments to eat and i aint too picky.. the place is nasty, and filled with a whole lot of people with drug problems. I felt a bit suspect when i walked in but still ordered, the staff is rude and ignorant,  got my order wrong. Bur i guess they go along with the crowd that comes in and treats everyone like that.. Be Warned not the best place ..and some Mcdonalds are ok..",0
Food was good but my boyfriend and I not feeling good and my boyfriend been throwing up ever since last night when we order our food never eating here again,0
"This McDonald's security is horrible. The Africa American lady talks down to people and rush you while your still within your 30 minute time limit. She calls the police every 10 minutes and her mouth is reckless towards paying customers. I've never been more horrified to go to McDonald's. Me & my friends eat there every day spending no less than $10 a piece. They just changed to this security company and they are very very nasty to paying cuatomers. She flashes her police badge to scare people away from here.
This woman is very unprofessional and something needs to be done before someone gets hurt. Thank you.",0
"DISGUSTING !!! that's the only way I can describe this place. It's 1:30 am on a Saturday and my Lord not 1 but 7 people either sleeping in booths or begging for food or money, and the bath room doors don't even lock. Is this allowed to happen? Is this how we run businesses in NY.  I guess McDonalds cares about ALL of their customers, no matter how unsafe they feel.  They just want their money and can't get sued by someone less fortunate, for being kicked out even if they haven't ordered anything. Good job McD's.",0
Two people got shot after an altercation at this McDonalds. I walked past this morning and two low life thugs were bashing each other up with blood spilling over their faces. Police had to restrain them. The cheap low quality food produced here attracts a horrible crowd. I wouldn't go here and I'm looking forward to this establishment shutting down.,0
"Omg whatever compelled me to come in here aside from the fastest and courteous service ever, it's frequented by the worst elements of society ever. Police or security needed here cause these methadonians and crack addicts are over the top not to mention least harassing patrons for money",0
"I went in was a monday afternoon, it was FULL of drug addicts and they took over the place, I believe there's a Rehabilitation Center near by and that's the reason. But however, I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE, unless you order to take out.",0
"No free refills on drinks, much more expensive than other McDonald's. The restaurant itself is in a sorry state of disrepair. Broken seats, tables with names carved into them grease splattered on the walls begs many questions about what goes on here. Having recently eaten in other McDonald's all over the world, this one has probably been the worst.",0
"This is the worst Mcdonald's I have ever been in. This place is the epitome of bad customer service. They charge extra for additional ketchup, do not offer free refills and a tiny portion of the dining room is open after 1 am. They close off most of the dining room. One time, I went in to order something around 1 am, but was unable to find any seating because other people were on their laptop hogging the booths and not ordering anything. They were taking up space. Mcdonalds staff did nothing about it when we complained about there being no seating. Most Mcdonalds offers free refills on medium and large drinks, but not this one. One time I asked the manager for a free refill and he was very rude and dismissive. This is not an ideal place to dine in at all, but it is still convenient to order a coffee there though.",0
"The employees can't tell the difference between Diet Coke and Coca-Cola, worst of all I asked them for a second drink and they still got it wrong!!  But they did do my Big Mac good so that why I give 2 stars",0
Just another place trying to automate to our detriment. Ordered on machine - requested eat in - asked for a table ticket. (What the hell is a table ticket) mashed in a number. Received a to go order and my sandwich didn't have the lettuce / tomatoes removed as I requested. Can we go back to the days of just ordering at the counter from a human being?,0
"This place is horrible! One of the employees allows drug addicts to use the restroom and hang out in the back. I stopped here because my aunt wanted to use the restroom. As soon as I took a look at the people hanging around, it was obvious.",0
Terrible location. Workers are slow and ghetto. Some don even wear a uniform. Random people come in and out the kitchen area an,0
"Too crowded, not ""Too dirty"",but not clean enough for me to eat in,order a coffee & go,that's just me.
Oh yeah, I've seen prices lower in other McDonald's like the one on 8th.av. bet.24th. & 25th.st.",0
Ordered for stay and followed the kiosk to use the table service. Waited for 15 mins and never delivered. Went to the pick up area and don't see my order number on the display.,0
I don't know what you did to your franchise but all I wanted was a cup of coffee and it took me half an hour.might have been better if your manager was there to help people and not on her phone,0
"This McDonald's is hit or miss, after you walk past the homeless and myth heads your food is nasty; bread is old or fries have no salt and not fresh. Outside smells like piss. Pick another McDonald's, caution.",0
They didn't have enough employees to take your order and they didn't have enough workers to make the food!!!! Horrible customer service they need to have more people working over there!!!!,0
Terrible customer service!,0
"it's your typical McDonald's. it's clean besides the crumbs on the tables but that's typical.

i didn't get any food, just some coffee; but it didn't taste right so i left it.

restrooms were also filthy when i went.",0
Regular Macdonald's but it was forbidden to fine-in even though many restaurants are reopening their indoor spaces and it was also impossible to go to the restrooms.,0
"missing part of kids meal, plus less of  following covid19 precussion- disorganized to that extent. gives opportunity of 10 strangers to gather on order or pick up session.",0
STOP EATING MCDONALD'S...PERIOD,0
"Dirty place, slow service",0
"They charged a price to replace coffee with orange juice in the breakfast that's almost the price to just buy a separate juice, didn't notify me and gave me someone else's receipt when I asked for it. When I came back in 5 minutes to buy the $1.99 2-burritos, I only got one and she refused to give me the receipt.",0
"I would never go  back  there!!!
It  was dirty and saw several drug deals while eating my food...
Never Again!!!!!",0
We had breakfast here a couple of times. Always tons of homeless people around. One guys was dancing like crazy. Pretty entertaining ...,0
I won't be visiting my local MacDonalds again after finding out about the awful conditions that their chickens endure. They are bread to grow so large that they are crippled under their own weight and live a life of pain and suffering. #ImNotLovinIt,0
"Loads of bums begging for food here, and despite there being a security guard, they allow it.  But on the bright side, they got my order correct and all.",0
this is my 2nd order Uber is great but my drinks were not delivered I did not say anything the first time but it happened again and when I tried to call the phone is not in service,0
"This McDonalds I'm not sorry to say is full of homeless people begging while people are standing in line with their families ordering. Also, drug addicts in the bathroom using drugs while customers are waiting to use it. Very poor upkeep of this location.",0
I was just there this morning homeless people were in there sitting down the security guard on his radio and not paying attention to what's going on.,0
"Horrible service. They got my order wrong so many times, like i order a customize sandwich and they made it with things i said no to.smh the mc donalds is very humid like there is no working air condioning",0
"Worst mc Donald in America. They have lots homeless people inside the place ,very dirty not well coordinated even thought it's in a good location for business. The management have to do something about it.",0
Too much loitering from homeless people.,0
"Too many homeless people in this establishment, can't enjoy a meal without being bothered by one!",0
They퐎e not open right now take the lady j,0
"No electrical outlets for customers in a fairly large restaurant. They also got my order wrong--I ordered an egg and cheese biscuit and got chicken, which at least is more expensive than what I ordered even if it wasn't what I wanted. Hash browns overpriced. They make it look like you get two on the kiosk graphic to trick you.",0
Female patrons enter this McDonald's at your own risk. There is a female heroin addict hanging in the females bathroom trying to assault and Rob female patrons in the women's bathroom. I advise you to not go to that mcdonalds,0
This McDonald's does not support the troops!,0
"The service was terrible. They only focused on food orders and drink orders were left behind the counter, piling up, and untouched.",0
Kia machine you pay for your order and then you wait about 15-20 minutes before the McDonald people give you your order you ordered sits up there and wait until the McDonald staff person give you your food great great modern technology,0
My mobile order was missing and the crew refused to help. They said there,0
dirty place....not hygienic...staff don t take correcty order... prefers talking with other people around...one cashier opened for more ten people waiting and boss opened a cashier especially for his friend and close it.and left...so no respect for the customers and not fair at all. finally a place to avoid,0
"This place was quite dirty and very noisy. We tried to order some food for dine in and it kept asking us table number. There is no number on any table. When I ask the staff, they said they will ignore that.... Very confusing.",0
"The new layout/technology is a disaster! Rough crowd,  most just hanging around and not eating.  Left with my meal due to the number of times I was solicited for cash and food.  Wouldn't hurry back.",0
I had not been here in a long time but that night the rest room was the most disgusting thing I ever seen. The food was descent even though I was working my Postmates.,0
"There was like no ac! The toilets were so gross!! The food was like normal McDonalds, but it lacked a good atmosphere.",0
"Gave me the wrong burgers, and seemed very dirty. I did come again though and the food was correct and tasted like normal McDonald",0
Very slow for late night. No communication with staff for efficiency. At least one of the employees at register is willing to admit fault for delayed food,0
This place does not have any regard for their kiosk orders,0
First day in NY. Maybe things are different here but the experience was terrible,0
"Place is overrun with vagrance and lowlives, Steph isn't any better this slow angry and miserable",0
"Ordered something and got something else. I asked not to include the bacon, but they added the Canadian Bacon and served me.",0
"This location is a dangerous place with a dark history. Avoid it if you can. If you decide to go keep your wallet and pocket book close and stay alert!
They have a makeshift memorial on one of the tables with candles and flowers!!!",0
Too Many drugdealers/homeless people standing in front of the store and inside the store. The staffs are very rude and sanitation is below average.,0
avoid going in the morning before 7 am you cannot even go in or out of the door with out stomping into a homeless person  cashiers not ready and mobile order system down cannot even get my order and the workers walk around like you don't even exist in the line,0
Dirty! Strange people inside,0
Dirty on the inside. Tables were filthy. Typical McDonald's with all types of sketchy people roaming it. Dangerous as well due to the drug induced people inside causing  commotion,0
At one time this was the best place to eat I eat here often years ago just came to see what has change and I can say it's the worst while it's clean not a good or safe place to be any more,0
"The two times i went there for lunch my fries where stale and there is a bunch or ppl from some rehab near by that sits in there and trys to sell stuff or arguing with each other , security is there but doesn't do a good enough job in my opinion",0
Worst McDonalds I've ever been to. Just awful customer service. We did go in after 10pm but it took 20 minutes to get the meal. Staff were busy joking around and messed up so many peoples orders.,0
"Dirty and unkempt. Limited staff around so tables not cleaned.
Seems to be a popular place for the homeless to visit.",0
"Very poor management if they be open at the time they say they're supposed to open it says 24 hours and I was hoping to stop by and get a quick breakfast before going to work but then they are closed but why even say you're open 24 hours if you're closed, not only that there are always homeless people infested at the doors here so I wouldn't recommend anyone going here",0
"We went at 2am, and even though there were less than 5 other people in the restaurant we waited 25 minutes for our food with no explanation. Food was fine but the wait was horrible.",0
"Asked for sriracha sauce, was confirmed that they had it. Yet when we got to the hotel, there was none in the bag. Quite disappointed.",0
Waste of my monwy,0
"Do you really need to be reading a review of McDonald's? Customer service and McFlurry availability is hit or miss, but the food is the same as any other McDonald's anywhere in the US, except that one that still has pizza.",0
"Not my kind of place, besides I stopped eating all red meat, unless it's organic or grass-fed beef",0
I got an vanilla milk shake and it was watery and warm not good it taste more like vanilla milk from the gallon.,0
Rude staff - doesn want to wor,0
"Its a mess , u order a u get b after 20 mins  when in NYC my advise would be go a a food truck and have delicious meal with peace of mind",0
"Disgusting! It's by far the worst MCD in the area. Filthy tables, people high on methadone, police activity... Horrible, avoid at all costs, especially if you have children.",0
There customer service is slow you always have to ask them for napkins and ketchup and always messing up my orders,0
"Came here twice as staying opposite, first time was poor but gave them the benefit of the doubt...unfortunately. Rude and ignorant staff...very unhelpful",0
"Requested a frying with no salt they give me one more salt,had to go to the Canta for ketchup up then have to go back again naken they did not  had none available by their soda stand",0
"Bad service, cold food. I didn't get my complete order and had guide the staff multiple times to complete the order.",0
Mobile Communication problems to order the food. Dirty and to many homeless people sometimes you scare to walk inside,0
Slow service.   Barely warm food.  Lobby dirty.  Order kiosks to replace human jobs.,0
"Dirty restaurant,  burgers were horrible. Sad how McDonald's levels are so poor .",0
A lot of drug users were hanging around inside. I did not feel safe.,0
"DO NOT EAT THIS TRASH. IT'S NOT WHAT IT APPEARS TO BE. DO YOUR BODY A FAVOR AND WALK RIGHT PAST. YOU MAY AS WELL EAT OFF THE GROUND, IT'S HEALTHIER.",0
"It's probably the worst McDonald's I've ever seen. Disgusting, dirty lousy staff. A complete nogo..",0
The dirtiest McDonald's I have every ate in. I saw inside drunk and homeless people even if there is a security guard inside. Not good for families.,0
More homeless people than paying customers... Yo could I have a fry  yes you may a quarter apiece how does it feel,0
Wayyyyyyy to busy for me as a tourist just to get chicken nuggets for a Toddler butttttttt then again it was a Saturday night lol,0
"The food was not hot, plus staff  need to talk to customers  better .",0
Very in consistent  salad contains rotting lettuce  noone ever answers the phone to call and complain wet spots all over the floor dirty and unorganized,0
"The night crew is the worst, slowest staff ever in the history of Shitdonalds. 25mins to take orders from 5 people.",0
"Nothing has changed with McDonald's, I didn't even order food I ordered a latte and they couldn't even get my order correctly. Smh!",0
Terrible service. Not very clean place. Can often feel unsafe after hours.,0
Food was fine but the homeless nearly started a brawl in the dining room.,0
"The women bathroom doors didn't close,  and they were for dirty . There were long lines to order food that was unorganized and crowded.",0
Terrible. I have ordered my food and after 15 mins the security came on me saying that I should finish and leave soon because I cant occupy the chair for too long,0
Doesn't open 24hrs. Tables gotta get cleaned but employees just spend time chatting,0
Worst mc donald's ever! Poor customer service and they mess up your orders.  Every time,0
Hell no...first if you get your food cuz the wait is ridiculous. This location is a mess ....,0
Shittyy slow service,0
Too crowded and not enough workers. The workers are so tired that they forget orders and screams to the customers.,0
Poor service had to wait 1 hours for fast food place is a mess and never clean,0

Horrible service always in the McDonald's on 34th and 8th.,0
They don't take directions well,0
I had to throw away the sausage because it was old and dried out.,0
They really need to clean this place out from these crackheads that just lingere there,0

"Terrible services, long wait times.",0
fuc# this place got harassed by junkies nice,0
Lots of homeless. Very creepy. DIRTY restroom.,0
Place smells security staff is a joke,0
"Sometimes the closing hours are not reliable! I cant tell you how many times I've had to cancel an uber eats order for delivery because somewhere the order was accepted but this place was closed! Disappointing to the customer who was looking forward to that late night/wee hours of the morning food and infuriating to me because that's MY TIME wasted and money not going into MY pocket! aka not getting paid for delivery!

On a personal note, I've had MANY upon MANY confrontations with the people who give me the food - I ONLY drink REGULAR dr pepper and as an avid soda drinker since elementary school (now 51) I know the difference between regular and diet - it seems like if you come here after a certain hour, even though I've asked for REGULAR DR PEPPER, I always seem to get one that tastes like a diet one! I have had them give me 3 dr peppers in one drive thru order just to end up with something that clearly was NOT a regular one!!! In addition to having the attitudes checked from those that gave me BIG ATTITUDE for being so, I guess ""insistent that this was not regular dr pepper, I would also examine the machines when they run low or tell the employees not to outright LIE about giving me regular dr pepper just to keep $1.40 - which btw, I'm curious as to why I was charged $1.41 for a large at this location when I'm ALWAYS charged $1.40 at the one on mathilda!!!????",0
Worst service I퐒e ever had told em I couldn pay at the screen where they have u order and I showed em my receipt and told me to wait cause he seem clueless on what to do didn ask for help just stood there and told me my order will be ready and walked away and obviously Ik I still have to pay and ten minutes pass than 15min pass than I퐉 like are u guys making my food and some lady like u didn pay I퐉 like obviously Tht what I told the last guy and she told me my food wasnEwanna get him in trouble,0
"Dining room closes at 7pm.  No self serve beverages.  Don't understand that at all.  The food is still good though, just have to put some ketchup on a Big Mac.  ",0
"Burger patties were served to us rare through the drive through. Both mine and my husband. I broke mine in half to show the picture.

Didn find out until we got home, unable to go back out now. I tried calling just to let them know this issue may be reoccurring throughout the night but nobody answered the phone. I",0
"I don't know how you've been called in 24 When I came to 3:30 in the morning it was 3 people in there and they say was close, How does a place advertise 24hr drive thru and only take cash after midnight. I don't see how corporate agreed with this.",0
Ended with a caramel frap all over my cup holder. My burgers had MC sauce all over it like they dipped it into the sauce. Just be careful I know is fast food but my car ended up super messy after my small meal.,0
"This store is so disorganized, plenty of people working not all that busy yet took 27 minutes to get food. I'm sure this is not the mcDonalds model.",0
"Absolutely done with this location, I always seem to get the same woman at the drive-thru I don't know her name but I know her voice and she screws up every single time then when I try and correct her she gets mad and acts like it's my fault. I don't know if she's special needs or something or there's a learning disability or if she's hard of hearing I don't get it. And even lately when I hear it's her I actually make sure to enunciate clearly but it doesn't seem to help. The young man that I occasionally get is always on point he has never messed up an order. I'm guessing she is related to management or has incriminating photos or something. She has absolutely no people skills and I will not go back to this place",0
"I have just bought two BigMacs, the first one contained no patties at all!",0
"Horrible!! It's cool that this McDonald's is a 24hr restaurant, BUT it's almost midnight with only one other customer and here I am, still waiting over 20+ minutes now!?? How slow can they be!? I can see 4 workers in here but that still don't explain this wait! These workers' sense of urgency is not there at all... Not even moving with any purpose! Maybe that is JUST the ""night""... So I hope.",0
Manager was rude. We asked simple questions about prices and deals and responded with no empathy.,0
"Waited in the dine-in area for about 15 mins for someone to take my order, workers pass by me and saw me and didn't even acknowledge me. Managers also pass by me and didn't even bother to ask if I was helped. Restaurant has ordering machines but there not working so you have to wait for any of the many workers there to acknowledge your existence at the restaurant to make a purchase. Will not be returning to this restaurant ever, rather take my money else where.",0
It claims to be 24 hours but when I stop by at 3:00 and 4 in the morning it's closed the cashier always tells me it's closed,0
"Customer service needs work at this location. I came in during my lunch time to get a simple McChicken and fries and a drink. Stood at the register for about 10 to 12 mins waiting for one of the many employees walking pass me to deliver the orders outside. Once they finally notice me, they took my order. After I waited around another 15 more mins to get my order. I was gonna ask for BBQ sauce but decided I didn't wanna wait an extra 5 mins for that. Overall, this restaurant only prioritize the drive-thru and not the dine-in area. Dine-in area has no cashier available because everyone is focus on drive-thru. So many workers on the front but none on cashier. If your coming here for lunch hour order online or else your lunch hour might turn into only 20 min lunch with all the waiting you'll be doing here.",0
This one McDonald's I find charging $2 for a large coffee everywhere else it is $1 for any size drink and the reason I go to McDonald's at all is because of the coffee but if they're going to double the price of the coffee then I may as well go to any 7-Eleven so I have to save this one particular McDonald's would not lower the price when I told him that it was $1 everywhere else. Arguing with a customer is not a good idea it would have been a better idea if she would have said I'm going to let it go this time but no they actually try to argue the point and I think that's silly the whole reason that I come there at all is because of the $1 coffee that is fairly good on a one to 10 scale I would say McDonald's coffee is it seven or eight with Starbucks being a 10 especially when they suggest you get the expresso shot that is $4.25 for the large coffee with the extra espresso shot from Starbucks and then there's creamer but that for dollar coffee is four times better than McDonald's one dollar coffee so you get what you pay for I just think McDonald's at that particular Stevens Creek location bites off customers,0
Pulled up at 4am. Waited 15 min in drive thru,0
Do not ever go to this McDonald's. One of the most dysfunctional places I've ever seen.,0
apparently if you ask for 2 cups of water here they will charge you for the 2nd cup ,0
2nd time ordering a filet o fish meal in this store and it just tastes so bland the fries were cold and hard. Regret spending  my money here.,0
"Lobby is always closed ,whan it's says is open 24 hrs",0
"If I could, I would give an absolute ""thumb's down"" to this embarrassing branch of a well-loved fast food franchise. NEVER will I return to it after being treated like a pariah. I was yelled at by the cashier who took the wrong order; and the branch manager threw a box of fries in the bag mumbling as if I was a beggar. In her condescending tone, the latter even warned me that she was doing me favor even though they made a mistake with my order and I did pay full price for it. I think they both need more trainings to acquire the best of American customer service.",0
Not good the drive thru they cannot manage who go first on the drive thru. And they talking like a frog they cannot hear even you shout. And when your to get the serve look around not doing his job properly,0
Not 24 hours. Exposed. Change your hours,0
"The soda machine wasn't functioning so they had to get your drink from the one behind the counter, the self order kiosks were all down, ordering took a little bit longer due to one cashier.",0
"Overall looks like it's falling apart. Ice cream machine broken half the time, mcflurry machine couldn't mix in the Oreos, roof is leaking...",0
Service was great but the chicken inside sandwiches were really not well. I had bad stomach for almost 3 days,0
Service is lousy and I tried to call number to complain to manager and no one answers/no voicemail.,0
"Bad service, I place order online and want to pick it by curbside, but they said the order isn",0
"I have been living in this city for the last 3 years , I took the decision to make a quick stop and get something to eat , wouuu food 5 stars special the coffee,  perfect coffee but the customer service wouuu 1 star is not enough ( the indian lady that I think is the manager ) terrible customer service and she was so rude with this customer that requeted and ketchup ... they really need to improve that...",0
"Given too many chances. I've tried to be polite no matter how rude the staff. Tonight I gave 1 more chance. My order was taken down wrong so I confirmed at the second window before taking the food. The woman was very upset she had to remake it, made it clear with snatching and attitude told me to pull over and when i got my order it was wrong AGAIN. Also took items  and was charged for adding lettuce.",0
"Worse McDonald's I've been to. I have decided to go a mile further to the Augustine Dr one instead at this point. Constantly slow, missing items or not making them correctly. Ordered for curbside at 8pm, was told restaurant was closed and I need to contact corporate for a refund",0
"Consistently gets our orders wrong. Including a time when we were complaining to the manager about constant errors and she was adamant that her team doesn't get orders wrong, they handed us the wrong order. Nothing wrong with the food but the staff needs better training.",0
Friendly staff but fries were stale!  They even took some time to put together my order giving me the appearance that a fresh batch of fries were coming out of the fryer.  I was wrong-they tasted like they were scraped off the floor.  Was here around 9pm last night.,0
"Night shift crew here is very iffy. Guy in front of me gets served, I get told the place is closed, and then the guy behind gets served. Honestly don't bother with this place. Big waste of time.",0
"One of the worst service, don",0
"Terrible customer service, Employees doesnt even smile or initiate the greeting. Very long drive through up to 30 minutes with just only 1 lane open. If I am a manager, I will never tolerate this long wait time. Drive through is suppose to be for the convenient and time saving but this service is just completely defeat the purpose",0
"This location is honestly hit or miss, usually employees here tend to be very impatient and rude, very rarely would I see someone who actually has good customer service.
Also they would get my order wrong from time to time...",0
"I ordered several times from this store but recently last order I made, the burger tasted like someone throw tobacco ash into it. It tasted wired. That",0
"I don't like giving low reviews without eating somewhere, but at midnight, seeing the sign on the window saying ""open 24 hours"", we pulled into the parking lot. The lights were dimmed and the drive through was blocked with cones. After leaving the freeway and going out of our way to stop here, they were closed and the sign held a false advertisement. Chances are we may not get the chance to visit when they are actually open, so heed my warning: THIS PLACE IS NOT 24 HOURS!!

Edit: After visiting that night, we tried again a little before midnight and the drive thru was still closed and blocked, and the sign still said open 24 hours.",0
There is a horribly rude worker here.  I asked to order something and she just gave rude and sarcastic responses the entire time.  I confronted her about it at the window and she didn't seem to care.  Talked to the manager.  He said he would handle it.  Im sure he won't so I contacted corporate and gave my report.  Don't eat here.  They do not care about customer service.,0
Slow service. No Ice at Breakfast.  Coffee tasted like cleaning solution was not rinsed out.  Hilariously a McDonald's employee was walking around the corner with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on a plate to eat for their own breakfast. Why no US flag?,0
"Shity customer service, incompetent cashier took over 15 mins to place a single man's dinner order (it was only a big Mac, fries and a drink).  Parking lot was full (extremely small for the volume of customers). Drive thru line was super long and extremely slow.  After I finally got to the window after I paid I had to wait there for 10mins just to be told to pull around and park.  Had to wait another 15-20mins to get my order.",0
"Not rated one star for this McDonald's, they actually happen to be a solid and enthusiastic group of people always willing to ensure your happiness and satisfaction. I just think McDonald's sucks in general. That being said, the staff at this specific restaurant is quite friendly and approachable, and I've never had a bad experience with the food or anything. They're usually quick and the food tends to be accurately prepared. In a world where this distinction mattered, I'd actually call this a really ""good"" McDonald's, but the significant other is bummed about their removal of garlic fries, and the ice cream machine is hellof broken all the time. Anyway. Bring vegan items to McDonald's.",0
Food was cold and hamburger was not cooked all the way. Ruined my lunch.,0
I was there at 437 am and was informed that i must wait until t for there 2 for 4 deal. I went back thru the drive through 2 more times once at 445 and once at 454 and was informed again that i had to wait until 5 exactly. Then when i finally got to order thwy also screwed me on a hash brown. They werent polite about anything and made me feel very unwelcomed.,0
I park into the parking lot I see 2 vans full of homeless people's junk. I walked in the MacDonald's bathroom one of the stalls was full of poop. Later I got my food . Was in my car ready to leave then I smelled poop   on my hands. The entrance door had poop from the person's hand. But on the bright side they gave me an extra meal for free. But the cleaning service was not good.,0
The staff was rude and needs training on their people skills. There was no good morning greeting and when asking about menu options it was like talking to a brick wall. The service was also very slow even though it was not busy.,0
"We enjoyed the food. But not the service, only for the fact we waiting over 20min and this was 8:30pm. My grandson was waiting on his aunt so she can walk with him and his mom &dad for there night walk. He has preschool in the morning.  And he has to be asleep by 9 and in bed by 8:30. So as for this gramas point of view. An apologiey for the wait or here's a free of anything would have been taken in to consideration would have been excepted.  But no nothing from any employee just didn't make me feel McDonald's employee's did there job.",0
"Constantly getting the order wrong on several occasions, poor attitude at pick up... Worked fast food when I was a kid... So easy to do it right and smile to the customer! Unfortunately their manager was the one at pick up!",0
"Took 10 minutes to order food while standing at the counter due to employees just chatting and ignoring me, in plain virw. Ordered a side salad and a yogurt parfait, bother were less then half filled. Overall not good, but eventually got service",0
Waited ~13 minutes for a simple hot fudge sundae (seems like my order was not placed on their electronic queue). Also pretty understaffed - cashier also dropping fries into fryer and running around doing other tasks.,0
"They removed tellers add kiosk which slows down the service. 10 minutes to get a Mcflurry and two cookies..... Mcflurry is small is tiny, cookies are as well. Kitchen floor was dirty. Kitchen crew was understaffed. It won't be sad to see McDonald's decline, I won't be going back to any of them. Rarely ever do won't be hard to put a nail in the coffin.",0
"There is something about the drink here...  One time I ordered Ice Tea and it tasted weird..  I let go of that one time..  And yesterday, I ordered the combo with Coke..  I ate and drank,  the next moment, I had like an ""diarrhea"" like symptom...  The coke tasted weird too..  I never had a problem like this when I ordered from other Mcdonald..  Last time the Ice Tea tasted bad so I tossed it away..  I only took a sipped that's why I didn't get a diarrhea like symptoms..  But this time I was so thirsty so I consumed half of the drink.",0
Placed our order through the drive thru.  Instead of getting a quarter pounder with my number 2 meal.  I received 2 plain mcgriddles We get home and order isn't right.  Tried to call and was unable to get through.  Not willing to go back out in the rain.  This has happened 2 other times at this,0
"Horrible Manager here came for coffee and she started giving me and my family an attitude about $2.00  rude
she had blonde dyed hair and wore glasses older than 50 years old disgrace",0
Just about to finish up my big Mac there at McDonald and what  do I find the biggest hair I퐒e ever seen I know it wasn,0
"food is ok, just regular McDonald, but the drive thru is insanely back late night. 30+ mins wait time while there are just 3 customers, like how is this acceptable? Soda machine, ice cream machine, or the cashier constantly broke down. After 35 mins when I finally able to get my food, they told me no credit card, like what ? why don't you tell me 35 mins ago? just left right away.",0
Drive thru was blocked at 1230pm. Had to make a 3 point turn to get out. Not sure why block it when there are cars (placed orders and waiting). Location is a nightmare since under renovation. Parking lot is taken by reno vehicles. Nearby has awkward design...,0
Very disappointed in McDonald's in today's world. To me McDonald's has really gone downhill is service is the pits. Any employees most of all can use a lot more training I know I used to be the head manager at 556 East El Camino McDonald's and I'm appalled of what it turn into. I know when I was head manager there we always have a store I can just imagine what it is today.,0
ordered a spicy chicken sandwich with cheese  no pickles. came in some aluminum bag all soggy nasty nsaty nsaty.  never again going there. should have gotten 0 stars,0
"2 people working, 1 learning how to work, and two cleaning, instead of helping the line of drive thru cars and 8 people waiting inside to place their order. Took a half hour to get two cheese burgers, two fries, and two drinks at 10:30 at night. And that was only half of what we ordered, so we left.",0
Went through the drive through and failed to check my order before getting on the road. Twice before I have been given the wrong order. How do they do that? Third time's a charm. I am pledging not to go to McD's again.,0
"You get what you pay for when going to any Mcdonald. This is a busy location 9 times out of 10 there is lines and being a 24hr location they're ice cream machine seems to always be out of order hahah go figure... I feel as if the food has become extremely salty at all McDonald's locations over the years not very good. Found myself not finishing the food I had ordered And still hungry. Go some where better.. If youve read this far, you deserve it.",0
"Probably one of the worst experiences I have had with McD's. 8 to 10 food alarms going off the whole time. The manager was outside smoking, leaving the staff to drown. The girl behind the counter spent more time apologizing to the same people over and over rather then work. Took about 20 mins to get two dollar menu cheeseburgers. Experience left a bad taste in my mouth. Probably won't give a second chance even.",0
I paid 1 hotcakes and 1 hash brown by drive through behind me couple cars lined up and I waited 5+ min to pick my food last time same order they missed hash brown so i was about to check the items but behind people waiting so I moved my car near by signal I checked hash brown missing again this time I want them to know so I turn and reach same drive through I explained one of the women staff came and ask my bag and she inspect I was not feel good at this point later she ask a male staff and discussing something and looking me like I'm lying ...Bullshit.... who train the business ethics and code of cundect what the #@$%,0
"Disgusting . And they legit took forever to release my order. My mcchicken was made wrong and they had to re make it. All in all, it took about 10 minutes for 3 items of the value menu, never coming here again. ",0
I waited a whole hour just for chicken nuggets after i ordered and i didnt even get the sauce for the nuggets. then i had to pay with cash and no one wore gloves or a facial mask.,0
"Against the background of other burgers, McDonald's is blown away, it's a pity that some of the first guys are now lagging behind.",0
"I go here a couple of times a day if they are on a roll of making good tasting unsweetened ice tea. Ocassionally I get a snack. They have on their menu pricing for pies. .69 each or 2 for 1.00. When I read pies, I think it is all their pies. Nope. Their ""specialty"" pies are more and when you call them out on it they are rude and don't care. Like the customer is supposed to be able to mind read, pies means only apple pie. It was annoying to be treated so rudely over cold mcd pies. If you leadership is so unhappy maybe they should go somewhere that is a happier place. We all have choices.

There is some good leadership at this store and bad. There is no in between. Take your chances. I mainly go there for the tea....when it's good.",0
"Twice in 6 months I thought I would get ice cream through the drive through. Both times they had no ice cream or yogurt. No sign, stick in long drive through to pick up nothing, not coming back again.",0
If you find yourself scratching your ears while inside it might be due to very small bugs that most people can't see or don't think the bugs are bothering their ear. My vision? Better than 20/20 both near and far. Thanks,0
"They spending millions to renovate all their stores to stay pertinate,while selling smaller portions of their fattining foods and raising their prices to pay for making the place look modern,anybody else notice that McDonald's has gotten way more expensive,taken alot of stuff away from what used to be the dollar menu,and took away alot of the all day breakfast",0
went there on new years eve around 2 am ..crowded very much and the queue was not moving for the next 30 minutes. they did not had enough staff. left with hunger stomach. They should have atleast informed us that there is going to be a waiting time . 4 ppl before us and the queue never moved for 30 minutes was surprising.,0
"Ordered a number 15 (chicken nugget) meal for $6.50. They somehow didn't get the fries part and only thought I ordered nuggets and drink (wtf?), even though I had made it very clear that I ordered the meal. Then they tried to charge me an ADDITIONAL $1 for the fries which would have put the total cost OVER the actual price of the meal. I wasn't having any of that bullsh*t and I guess they realized how ridiculous they were being, because they relented pretty quickly and handed over the fries.",0
It was great the view was from where i sat was the  entrance door. From where she sat was the soda machine. In the middle was the order line. We sat at a table that was designed for people in the order line waiting to order  to look back some look straifht on and see you eating. Why? So they can get humgrier? They already hungry. Its probably because if your a kid eating a happy meal and they have toy there gonna want one too so you tell your parents you want one too. Or I whatever there eating they want to eat too because they are too lazy to look at the menu. Thats too much work. So the put a table for people to view where are eating. It menu ideas and advertisement.,0
They had everyone wait in an extremely long line at the drive thru just to tell us it was cash only. Which should absolutely not be a thing at a McDonalds. We then had to continue waiting in line since there was no way out.,0
"Pathetic customer service, never attends customer queries over phone. It says its open24 hours, but in multiple occasions cancelled the orders placed via delivery apps citing that the restaurant is not accepting orders.",0
Lady placing the orders is super nice. The crew making the food complete morons. Mixwd up order and put wrong condiments on wrong one. Its like they just tossed it together. Not tomention there is no way it'll pass wights and measurmentz. I expect competence.  Which is clearly lacking here.,0
"Be a Careful with this Store
He charged me $1.39 + tax for a coffee. I remained him about McDonald's coffee price ($1.09+tax). But he said no & I back to my car, took more money then paid. (Store no. 4324, receipt 300, date feb.22/16 mon. 20:25)",0
"I went to use the restroom here, and the toilet was all full of **** so I told the manager about it. They sent a guy to clean it and I kid you not after he was done he did not wash his hands. I would not be surprised if this McDonalds will get an E.Coli outbreak",0
"Sorry but breakfast sandwich was not fresh It was hard bread and as slow as it was on a Sunday  morning everything should of been made  fresh sad I
will not stop at this location again",0
slowest mcdonalds I've been. Waited for 30 min. Think they are short in staff or either the staff is sleeping,0
"Every time I come to this one, they are closed. I even ordered something through the app and they still turned me away. Need to change hours online from 24hrs to closed from 3-4AM!!!!!",0
The food that McDonald's is not food in my opinion and no one should eat fast food of any kind. Now that is my opinion. But the breakfast sandwiches are great especially with egg,0
"The clerk is not responsive, she doesn't have any reaction when we order. Silent for a while.",0
Worst service ever. Waited over 40 minutes in drive thru. Only to get cold food. Never will i go there again. Horrible service. I would have given 0 stars if I could.,0
"Contrary to the google page, this place is NOT open 24 hours. Cut off time is 2am.",0
Ordered a big mac for the first time in 20 years.  Very disappointed because there was not enough thousand island dressing in my burger.  This will be the last time that I will be eating at McDonald's.,0
"!! Fraud location !! !!!Fraud location !!!, the manager told us they have different policy for this location they don't work any more with the corporate , I am really worried about What's This now , they said they only respect the online ordering coupons if ur ordering at drive thru ( in photo ) the manager given us , health department must check this location carefully bcoz something is fishy here .. or Macdonald corporate MUST HAVE A CHECK On them URGENTLY, avoid it",0
"Made me wait in the drive through overflow parking, messed up half my order. I should have checked but I wanted to leave by then.",0
"Under construction, had drive-through only, and somehow ""didn't have water."" McDonald's makes the worst breakfast sandwiches, but that's not particular to this location.

Only pro is open 24 hours.",0
"Waited 15 mins in the Reserved for Drive thru spot for my very simple order, and they missed two of the items that I've ordered and paid... Speechless",0
What kind of McDonald's only open till 7:00 p.m. for dining room,0
Wanted to go thru the drive thru. But it was closed. Had to go inside very crowded. And slow. First i went to the other mcds. Up the street on lakeside. Went inside and they said were closed caused of understaffed. All these mcds. R getting very awful on service.,0
"I waited in the curbside parking for 15 mins.no one delivered the order.i had to go to drive thru ,stand beyond 10 cars and had to pick up the order.

Very pathetic customer service.

I will never visit again",0
I have gone to this McDonalds twice and it has taken at least 15 minutes to get my order. Granted both times were after midnight but this location stays open 24 hours and even late night should not take longer than 5minutes. Worst McDonalds ever!,0
"Service good,tables extremely dirty..not enough employees to come out from back counter to even help wipe down",0
New Morning crew SUCKS! Just went there this morning 9/26/13 8:20am through the drive-thru waited at the second terminal as three cars went passed on the left. So I move forward without placing my order. The girl at the first window told me I should have waited in stead of saying I am sorry how can I help you.,0
I went drive thru I keep saying hello no one is answering me so I decided to go all the way to the first window to ask why isn't working but the guy is ignoring me he already saw me stopped at his window waving honk my horn so I have to go around again to use the other window to order the when I got to his window to pay I asked him..he said I have to wait cause its not working he can only take one customer..they should have just closed it so no one will go thru there..bad service not very accommodating..ignoring customer when they need help..,0
They did not answer the phone even though I was trying to report an urgent safety issue happening on their property. Who knows whether any of them even knows where this phone is located.,0
Customer Service is a hit or miss. Last time i ate there i got sick. So now i see why i stopped eating fast food like this..,0
"Understaffed!! I had to wait 20 minutes in the drive thru and another 25 parked in line just for a mcgriddle. Seriously?? Oh and ""jasmine' has a terrible attitude",0
I give 2 stars out of five because the ice cream machine wasn't broken twice out of the last five times I came to get ice cream.,0
Food was ok but management decided to start yelling at ine another and cursing. Made my daily dinner visit very uncomfortable. To the point of not returning. At 6pm on 4-11-16,0
No smoking in the outside seating is not enforced by the manager. In fact I saw an employee hanging over into the dining area to smoke as well.,0
"Sold a ""McFlurry"" then delivered an un-blended pile of ice cream topped with crumbs.",0
They퐒e the ,0
"Me and my friends went to get a quick snack in the drive thru, we waited for more than 30 minutes to get our food",0
"Staff is slow, especially at drive thru. Drive thru orders almost always wrong.  Bathrooms always out of toilet paper. Majority of customers coming to this location are rude.",0
Went in and the cashier didn't want to take my order she wanted me to do it for her when the restaurant was not busy at all this type of behavior is unexpected in the workforce,0
Im lactose intolerant and  i asked for 2 sausage burritos with no cheese and they gave me one without cheese and other one with cheese. This is no fun.,0
Long waiting !!! Never ever come in drive thru... more thn 30 mins still in line ... there is no discussion regarding food bcos it's mc dddd,0
I ordered a coffee through drive-through this morning.  What I got is a cup of water!,0
I had to wait 20 minutes for my order they were to busy doing the drive threw rhan the customers inside not enough help,0
Breakfast crew were very scattered and inefficient. Overheard multiple confused orders. Took two people to pour coffees and refill pots! Lots of yelling behind the counter!,0
"They were out of chicken nuggets, there was no ice in the soda machine, and there was a bean in our big mac... Does McDonald's even have anyrbing with beans in it?",0
Just like any McDonald's  no trill the employees can be  jackass to some people.,0
Rude drive through operator.,0
How does a place advertise 24hr drive thru and only take cash after midnight. I don't see how corporate agreed with this.,0
"Waited 20 min for my order, fries was cold and hard. Very disappointed and dissatisfied..",0
"Not busy, but slow service. Very unkept restaurant, garbage scattered, and fountain drinks/ice depleted.",0
They discriminate against vegetarians charge more than any other McDonald's for no meat on breakfast sandwiches. Make you pay for meat you are not eating!,0
Didn't have what I wanted which was mcgruddle patty in my area they sale it all day here they don't. They should everywhere.,0
"Eh it's McDonald's, fries are good, sodas are priced right and the new double cheese burger is actially pretty good - for McDonald's.",0
No tomato ketchup for fries and no bbq sauce for chicken nuggets. Problem with the order. Not a happy camper :(,0
"Terrible customer service, insane wait times, parking lot is way too cramped for how many people come in.  Drive thru almost always has you park around the corner and wait more.",0
False advertisement open 24hr..They close at night all the time,0
The worse mcdonalds ive ever been to..i waited in line for 15 minutes and to top it off the customer service sucked because the lady at the window was so rude i left.,0
Drive through again didn't get the Sausage Egg McMuffin Right.... Third or fourth time. Probably should go inside.,0
"Always old tasting fries and hard buns. I don't expect McDonald's to be anything super, but this is noticeably disgusting",0
Sketchy late at night. Cash only and no receipts.,0
There is no lunch today. very bad.,0
"I went to this place and asked for an ice cream, and he is like we don have ice cream,",0
Took half an hour to just get 4 piece tenders employees standing and joking around with each other,0
"Bad service, and take FOREVER. Slowest Ive been to. This time it was because the guy was calling the wrong number for my order..",0
Service was awful didn't understand my order,0
I dried going to this place. This place messes up more times than getting it right. Bad MD.,0
"wait for an hour in drive through path. And cash only finally, I waste one hour here!",0
"Drive though ,
1. One meal was missing burger.
2. bad potato in one of the fry.
3. Slow delivery compare to other mcdonals",0
Probably the worst run mcdonalds Ive been to in a long time. Workers are sloppy and food comes out crazy slow.,0
Only because of the lack of training is why only did one . So much n,0
They never get my order right. The service sucks,0
Don't go there. There's a European guy who's very mean to customers and he's the worst human being I've ever met.,0
mf wasted my time saying open 24/7 bt they are closed.,0
Rubish fires.. 2 mins after they were cold and tasted like soap for some reason,0
Really slow services for late night. Drive thur was so slow. They wanted me to park for a soda. I refused.,0
Workers were not friendly. They picked and chose who to serve. Some were told that the lobby was closed and some were served.,0
They keep messing up my order but what did u expect its McDonald's,0
MacDonald'still relies on fat and high glycemic carbs to make the food palatable,0
"Breakfast was not hot enough, hate warm hash brown sausage etc....It's getting worst and slop by the day and EXPENSIVE",0
"Bathroom floor  all wet toilet leaking  constantly  also  no toilet paper

Also very dirty

District manager needs to see this place  :(",0
Drive thru is closed!   There,0
Awful place. Really. Bad service and everything is dirty and stinks,0
"Terrible...........

Avoid this McDonald's. Terrible service, incorrect bill charges. Just a bad experience.",0
hated it we had to wait for food and then when we got home and looked at our food my bigmac that i order with no lettuce had no cheese instead of no lettuce,0
Could not find our order came out 6 times,0
Got food poisoning from breakfast. Rude service inside the dining room.,0
I've been coming to this McDonald's for so long. And it's always dirty. Tables are all dirty.,0
If you eat here more than 80% of the time your food will be wrong or cold.,0
"Fast food , when there is nothing else open late night",0
Cheap food but burgers taste so genero.,0

"They walk as if asleep, the cashier didn't even know what he was buying and for me they badly cooked the meat with all the paper and they gave it to me, you can't imagine how disgusted it gave me",0
Because the manager and her cats are abusive liars and I tell them because this lady is a discriminator despite the fact that she is a Mexican who when they have a little puss they think they are duos,0
"Very bad service, almost every time I go they tell me to wait and they take too long to deliver my things 占쏙",0
"Terrible place, even though it's 5 minutes from my house, I'll never go to that place again. I'd rather go to the next McDonald's, even if it's a little further away, but they know how to serve their customers there",0
They give you the wrong orders and they charge you more,0

"A friend and I placed two separate mobile orders for drive through and theses two female employees are refusing to give us our orders because it didn go through supposedly so we show them a receipt. They gave my friend his food, but they were refusing to give him his drink and my food. These to employees gave us a hard time calling us names in Spanish which we could understand what they said. We go to this McDonald quite often and never had a problem until today they insult us and being rude for their mistake and not paying attention thankfull",0
Pulled up to the drive through. Never got anyone to take my order. Car pulls into other com spot instantly get order taken. I wait some more a second and third car goes through the order. I sat there 3 or 4 minutes and 3 cars on the other side before I pulled away. Never had this problem at this before and I go here once a week bc I work down the road. But I will not return because it's nonsense. The car before me in that lane got there order through no problem.,0
"There ""service"" today was terrible. The menu displayed was not even available so when ordering from it you were told to order something else they never came to the window to collect the money after waiting in line for 10 minutes at window one simply to pay for my order I ended up driving away. If your not staff for a 24 hour business close at night.",0
I hate this location more and more. I come atleast 3x a week for breakfast between 5-7am. Today the system is 폻own?they are not taking cards or the app. Cash only and no receipts also my change is short but since there is no receipt what can I do? 90% ,0
"Worst experience at McDonald
Lady was so sarcastic and rude.
Not to mention she looked super unprofessional.
Super rude service at speaker and worse at the window.
She realized I was upset over the terrible service and has the audacity to say 퐕ou having a bad day??I really tried not to argue and fight over some ignorant person being miserable over their job getting paid $10 so I said
폠m great?I ask for the price because she never told me it and she sucked her teeth rolled and her eyes at me and told me it.
And then charged me.

She was giving me this nasty death stare like I l cause I used to work for McDonald. Every quarter meat is cooked to order, the McDonald was empty ",0
"Terrible! Ordered an artisan grilled chicken sandwich and this is what I got. Old soggy lettuce. So that tells me the person preparing the sandwich just didnt care or that this restaurant does not care about keeping fresh items in their kitchen. $8 for this meal to get home just to throw out this sorry excuse for a sandwich. And this was after I had to go BACK through the drive through a second time because my son's happy meal was missing the fries. I mean isn't there a screen that shows what should go in the bags before handing to the customer? And after the second time through I got home to that trash sandwich and they also forgot the sauce for the nuggets, even through I saw it on my receipt so they knew I wanted it, and hot cakes without butter. Just carelessness on all fronts at this location. Oh and when I got to the pick-up window I told the woman I have a boy so please put a boy toy in the happy meal, and she said all of our toys are unisex. I will include a picture of his ""unisex"" toy. Take the time and drive pass to the next McDonalds along your route.",0
They need better training on how the app works if the payment doesn go thru it tells you payment failed it would not give you a code to pick up food if it not paid for  tonight crew  the so called manager 11:40pm 12/08 do better if a 30% coupon was applied and the payment came out and the app generates a code why would we have to pay you $5more dollars that would make us pay full price 30% off is the $5 슬 shows it out of my account they tell me it didn go thru so I have to pay again at the store no way how does that even make sense cancel order once again food an time wasted get new employees who know what they are doing it always the,0
As we walk in a girl behind the counter identify her self as the manager  she said her name was Maria  with a real nasty attitude disrespectful to the customer saying if I'm off the clock I'm not helping any one I felt really ashamed to be standing there witnessing the way the customer infront of me being treated so I left to go somewhere else,0
"If I could give this place a -0000000 I would. I placed my order and paid at 8:20pm.  I waited literally over 30 minutes for my food. Once I received my food, I made sure to check to see if everything was there. The order was completely WRONG. How do you get an order wrong when everything is on the receipt? I will never understand. The fries were cold and once the order was remade we got home only to find out that the meat was raw. Never again. 폟aving a lot of orders?shoul",0
"Therese some more good places than this one ,",0
Lack of customer service. I wish McDonald's will invest in improving their hospitality more than  spending alot of money in advertising .,0
"A young girl Maria calls herself the manager is rude,unprofessional argues with customer when the customer claimed that she was ignored at the counter she became very confrontational and screaming.",0
Stopped over to pick up a coffee.Manager wanted to charge me for milk in my coffee? Creamer is ok?? Will avoid this place next time.,0
"Worst customer service ever, try order at speaker no answer then went to window n was treated like trash by manager jeina and employee joein, they definitely don't deserve their position,they don't care about customer, I told them I wanted to order Tru window cuz had no answer in speaker and joeine said if I don't go around I would stay parked at window all night then he cursed me and closed the window I wish I had a camerA on to show this to the world all over social media shame on McDonald's, I definitely will avoid this business for rest of my life this happen today November 23rd 4am 2022",0
Cold food and an unusual long wait in drive thru,0
Worst wait times ever...and u never get a response at the drive thru until u say hello a few times,0
There is always a situation in this location besides waiting time and not serving the right order today what the worst of all times I was in the driveway and waiting for my turn to be served they made me wait for 10 minutes and the lane next to me was passing like two times and then I park my car and I get off my and walk inside the store and I asked for the manager and the manager came out looked at me and then when inside and then come back and  I explain the whole situation and then make wait again ?.she went inside talk to someone who was in charge of the drive line  and then come back and they start giving me hart time about the order ,0
"Every time i came to this place the ice cream machine never works so never i can try milshake or things like that but every time i approached to the drive through i see the employees drinking shakes or eating ice cream!!!. Then food very poor make it. Every time I visit it's at night at Drive Trough!. I keep coming sometimes  because my little girl loves it. And I always tough it will be better But Nop it's not. Bad Service, Bad Attitude poorly food made.",0
Sign's all say 24hrs...printed paper on drive thru menu board...we will reopen at 5am due to system being down. Doubtful...at least they could be honest...will reopen at 5am because we can't find anyone to work overnight. This has been going on for nearly two years now.,0
"Mcdonald lately its service is not God. People in there including the manager are not the same as always. They don't have patience, they don't treat people like it use to be.  Right now Chick-fil-a is way better than McDonald in god service period.",0
Gave it a 2nd chance.  They don't clean out their tea machine.  Unsweetened tea tastes bad.  Pay 2.15 for a large tea and they want me to bring it back.  Money returned first time and this time it will cost more in gas to turn around.  Don't use this mcds.  Unprofessional and dirty,0
"Horrible management and customer service
I could give this location zero stars I would. I waited in line for 30 minutes to place and order.
Then 12 minutes to pay for it. Once they handed me my food the fries were cold so I asked for fresh fries. The cashier gave me and attitude then said something to the manager who came to the window saying he made the fries and I said they are cold can I have fresh fries? He repeated that he made them and if I wanted fresh fries I would have to pull over. I stated I have been waiting 45 minutes Ill wait right here. So he slammed the window shut and called the police. I moved
the car and 30 minutes later Im still waiting, no police have come so I asked for a refund. He refused to refund me and started cursina like crazv.",0
Some type of plastic found in my burger after checking to see if it had onions in it after I asked for no onions( of course it had onions) called no answer,0
Arrived 10:45 and NO SERVICE NO RESPONSE TO THE DRIVE THRU,0
They got mostly all the orders wrong and also had a few customers including myself waiting more than 10 minutes,0
"When this restaurant switched from Corporate to Franchise a few years ago, I was really happy with the changes that were made, the owner was seen there frequently, the employees seemed happy to be working there and everything was running smoothly. Now in 2022 the lines are terrible, when taking your order they give you the total without asking if more items were needed, seldomly the employees smile at you, and you see that the employees are bothered by the customers. I stopped visiting as often as I did because the service went downhill. Today I visited only because a friend wanted some food for her son. Unless serious changes are made I don't plan to visit again.",0
"""Food health safety"" is not in the vocabulary of the staff at this location. Every time I get food from here (usually through someone else going to this location despite me telling them specifically NOT to go to this one) I get stomach pains, diarrhea, and sometimes I even vomit the morning after. Once called to complain and their response was ""just don't eat at this McDonald's"". What a joke, this place should be shut down

Edit: almost forgot to mention the one time they didn't even cook a patty all the way through. Was still pink in the middle. Like, you have one job when you're grilling burgers.",0
"McDonald's quality, What can I say the quality taste and preparation have gone straight down the toilet. Of the 3, taste is suffered the most. there.  fries used to be the best now they're the worst  It's so bad I try to use McDonald's as a last resort.      The last resort",0
This McDonald's is soppesdly 24 hrs but always says they can't take orders around 3am ! This is b.s ! And it's constantly yet the one near waterford lakes has no issues taking orders!? There needs to be new management seriously!,0
"This McDonalds has quickly gone downhill over the last year. Service is slow, on Friday evening or night plan to spend 20 to 30 mins in the drive-thru, and you better check your order before you leave. Multiple times items have been missing from my order and just last week I only got 10 of my 20 pieces for the 20 piece nugget I ordered.

If this is what we can look forward to as minimum wage continues to climb I won't be getting this for my kids much in the future and will just make chicken nuggets and fries at home...",0
"The most incompetent staff and management I've ever experienced in a fast food restaurant. Items missing in my order even after I asked if it was placed in the bag, Rude staff, very unprofessional, laughing/ joking with other employees while on the headset taking my order. Business number that appears online is disconnected, so you can't reach any management. Not even thru the survey online you can get anyone from corporate. Definitely I rather microwave a dollar burrito than come back here.",0
"Fast food with tast quality that is slowly diminished till it helps tast is terrible.  I remember going McDonald's as a child the fries were the BEST now they're the worst, sloppy gooey mess. I actually use McDonald's as an absolute totally worst and last case scenario",0
"Went at 11 pm after a night out with the kids. The drive thru person that was taking my order was the MANAGER TATIANA she was rushing me throughout my whole order and even said OH MY GOD because she was getting aggravated. The one person that has to set the example of customer service should be fired. I've never had a manager to any establishment talk to me in that way. And to top everything off the nuggets to all my orders were so sheet and not crunchy, like they sat on the warmer for hours because the employees were too lazy to fry up new ones. This McDonald's has gone so downhill. First it was the employees now it's management. They need a whole new crew",0
Went on a ice cream run for my pregnant wife and I know you don't go to McDonald's for their outstanding customer service lol however this visit the staff was unbelievably rude. It almost felt like a skit on what would you do.,0
"This place makes it difficult to spend money here. They cannot get a drive through order correct to save their lives, they turn away cash money, and they generally have rough customer service at best. Save yourself the trouble, go down the street to damn near anywhere else.",0
"The employees seem to be too busy talking then making the orders correctly.  Them men's restroom is gross as well, looks like they don't bother cleaning it.",0
Mosr of the food was delivered after we were sent to the parking lot since it was 2 big breakfasts and a mcgriddle with 3 drinks. Food was delivered within a few minutes but after waiting 10 minutes we had to go back into the drive through. Because they forgot our drinks. After we went back they gave it and when we went home they forgot to give us straws and the extra hashbrown we ordered. Food good but lacking service. Very nice cashier lady but the food handler wasnt as nice.,0
Chicken nuggest are good in my book when first made. I can't stand ordering food and smelling like it. McDonald's isn't really a place I go to. The place seems questionable.,0
"I usually DONT have a problem with McDonald's but tonight was different.  I was ordering something for my granddaughter,  then I wanted something for myself.  I was looking at the menu and the person who was taking my order was very impatient with me,  acting as if I was preventing her from going sometwh.ere.  I said can you give me a minute please,  she replied under her breath ""that's all you had to say in the first place "" then when I went around to pay, she disappeared and had someone else accept my payment.  Then I was handed  my food  with stares and nothing Said by the staff. Needless to say,  I threw away the food. Not about to play games with these little high school kids.  A company who cares about their reputation should try to train and manage their workers before hiring them.  Horrible service tonight.",0
How hard is it to give people the right order?? The drive thru chick with the braces was too busy gossiping with her friend to give me the correct order on 09/25/21 at 9:15-9:30am. Stop gossiping in Spanish and work. $15 an hour where??? Hell No,0
"Uusually I like McDonald's but not today..  Ordered a crispy chicken deluxe meal.. Everything was cold, especially the fries.  The one thing they usually don't mess up.  YUK!!",0
"The worst Mc Donald's I have ever encountered.
Order just 2 sausage McMuffin with egg when I got it the bread was so hard at then ends it gum as I bit it I took both back after I got the fresh sandwiches I left I had to again return cause those new sandwiches had no eggs I wasted 26 min of my UBER/LYFT time even had to cancel ride .

These managers there needs to be on point and consistent with there employee and monitor a little more the food that goes out the store already cooked.",0
"Terrible experience at the drive thru. Whats going on mickey d's?

First, girl at the window messed up my order, then she gave me only 1 straw for an order of 2 drinks. To add worse on my list of service, she waved my drink up and down at me like i'm a dog.

Thank you, i won't be back anytime soon.",0
They used to be great but now the new managers are not trying to make customers happy. I asked for fries during breakfast and was told no the new store manager said they can't comply. I even told them I would wait. The other staff here are great and friendly. Sorry that your new managers are not following the corporate way,0
"You guys mess up my Uber orders every time without fail. Whether it be a straw, a drink, an entire meal, or even an apple pie- you guys forget at least one of those things every time. I reordered the items that were missing from my previous Uber Order today and as soon as my courier reached your McDonald, you guys disabled your Uber eats opti",0
"Every time it never fails that you mess up, my Uber Eats order is always incomplete. The fries are always old. On an average, I spend over $30 for you to mess it up. Either you forget the sauce for the nuggets or you forget to put straws in the bag.",0
"I went to drive through
And some of the employees are very rude not customer friendly
They messed up my order
Everything if not my food is cold I will never but from them.ever again my husband and I highly recommend do yourself a favor gi buy at mc donalds in the other south obt location tgere food always fresh and they very  friendly",0
"I needed a pick me up and stoped by for some iced coffee. Since I am diabetic , i can only have regular  cold coffee with milk , no flavored milk . Still i had to pay full price for a med cold coffee  (with only 3 ice cubes I wished for ) came out for almost 2 $ ! I think this is pretty unfair , overpriced and pure profit ! So I am not ever going to buy anything from Mc.Donald anymore .",0
"Drive through was exceptionally speedy when I got waived off to park. I had asked for a cup of water to still get waived off. I get my meal and asked about my cup of water the staff member seemed to not car and walked away. I walked in to ask for a water cup to have the rest of the staff say that if I wanted a water cup with a lid in a small cup, I would have to be in drive through... Where I came from... It wasn't until a shift manager 3 associates later did they ok for me to have a child cup of water.... Water.",0
"The manager and the staff here treat customers very disrespectful. I ordered two quarter pounders and they were pink in the middle. We asked for a remake and was told that's how they are made. After we pushed for a remake the ""redone"" was still pink. The manager sarcastically asked for extra extra extra well done burgers, at which I noticed the cooking staff laughing and one was wiping their nose and face with their arms. After I immediately cancelled my order and asked for a refund. The night staff compared to the day staff is just like that; night and day. If I could give no stars I would.",0
"Worst McDonald's experience ever.  Do not visit this location. It doesn't matter how many times you ask for a special request with your food, they will still make it wrong and than lie to you when they give it to confirming your request was done, when in fact it was wrong the whole time.  They will not give you your complete order the first time, you have to drive around and wait inline again or go inside to get your order correct, and if you don't double check it at the counter, they may get it wrong again. I do not recommend this location to anyone. ",0
"Waited 10 minutes in front of drive thru pick up window, while 2 employees had their backs to me only to get cold soggy fries and a chicken sandwich that wasn't hot and tasted like it was cold leftovers.    So yeah this experience was GARBAGE",0
Orange juice add water..no taste n water flavor?? Water x extender juice..chiring... cheaper..not respect x costumer..then  server say I don't know..not take responsibility..not good,0
Went at night. And it was terrible. These ladies take your order through drive thru and you wait and wait and wait. 30 minutes on the drive through. Call corporate on these ladies. Horrible service.Next time im hungry i will go somewhere else.,0
"Horrible service,, manager Donnie did nothing to assist. Only drive thru was being served and that's because of it being timed.",0
"Piss poor service. Didn't bring drinks over with our order. When we was asked for the cups, got nothing but a snotty nosed look and the server walked away and never returned.
Seemed to be the general attitude of all the staff involved including the senior on duty.",0
If I could give zero stars I would there lazy to make guava pies I ordered 3 and they gave me 2 I paid for 3! Then they said it 12 mins to wait that fi,0
Terrible I thought they had great food at one point however I'm thinking that Burger King is going to be better for me from now on....the simple fact I went yesterday at 3:00 in the morning to go get a burger and they gave it to me ice cold then I had to wait on the line like about six cars in front of me in order for them to get the sandwich right then they put very little bit of lettuce which I asked for extra lettuce I don't care if I have to pay for it I just want my extra lettuce and no pickle on the double McDouble anyways I don't know but I might eat them but not as much as I was eating them before and as for their fries well they were good,0
"The drive thru manager at night, is extremely disrespectful. Never going to this McDonald again. She does not talk to you without yelling or offending you.",0
I was discriminated by a drive Thru today for me being hard of hearing . Employees at this McDonald's are always extremely rude. They should be thankful in hard times like now they have jobs. Went thru drive thru w my kids was placing my order and cashier told me she would not take my order cause I was not fast she also said things that were rude and inappropriate.,0
The McDouble is terrible. Very dry and very little ketchup and mustard on it. Couldn't finish my first one. Bread should taste soft and fresh. Meat should be juicy. And they through it together which makes a mess. And hardly any onions on it. Fries should be soft not hard and with plenty of salt on them. ALL burgers should be juicy. That's what makes a great burger.,0
"We were in the DRIVE THROUGH  for 30 MINUTES.  They messed up a simple happy meal order. I went inside to speak to the manager and told him that the fries were ice cold and they never gave me the drink that comes with it.  The manager never apologized he just looked at me and said ""ok"". He gave me the drink and new fries.  The employee was the one that had to apologize for him because he didn't hear an apology from the manager either, so after a pause of the manager just staring at me the employee said I apologize. Unbelievable, how the training for these managers are at this store.",0
"Is it Ghetto? Yes.
Was my order right? No.
Will I ever go back? No.
Will I recommend? Hell no.
The problem I had was that this McDonalds is in a not desirable area. Theres homeless roaming the streets and panhandling right in front of the entry of McDonalds.

If you want a clean, safe and nice atmosphere go to a McDonalds in a ritzy area. They do not tolerate these types of behaviors.",0
The 1st window cashier was very rude she had a attitude I asked for the manager she act like she didn care what went on in the store or cared to hear my complaint if someone has the correct number for ,0
"Worst McDonald's visit ever. Started out standing at counter for 5 minutes before anyone looked at me and acknowledged us. Burgers so greasy you'd have to go out of your way to make them this bad. Ate in, took 30 min to get food, than messed up order. Burgers falling out of wrappers. Outside of wrappers soaked in grease. Cold fries.",0
"Horrible service, nobody knows what they're doing, they short you on everything. The guy at the window with painted nails was listening to music on his phone with both earbuds in and didnt say a word to me, I ordered pancakes with sausage and a medium coffee. They gave me a small coffee and kept saying that's what a medium is now, and it wasnt even drinkable. I know this is my fault for not checking especially after that, there was no butter, syrup, napkins, or utensils in the bag for the pancakes and sausage. Never coming here again",0
The worst MCDONALD'S I've been to and I'm from NYC! The managers look like they dont shower and the food is always terrible!! Drive a few miles down john young and you will find better spots. DONT BRING YOUR MONEY HERE! HOPEFULLY THEY WILL GO OUT OF BUSINESS AND MAKE ROOM FOR A GOOD RESTAURANT!!!,0
"I like to work here on days when I퐉 in this area, but there nowhere to plug in my laptop. I퐉 informed by the staff that almost all McDonald",0
"bad service , was trying to order and the lady walked away after nothing was happening and she was just talking to a guy instead of helping and trust me if i could give 0 stars i would but that not possible. Thank you - Juliana and i would like a contact saying you fix this and maybe ev",0
"6/9/2018 7:15pm. ordered food through drive through, paid at first window received drinks at second window, was told to park in curbside #2 to wait for the rest of my food. 20 minutes and 15+ cars roll through drive-thru before I went inside. there was some confusion as to what happened to my order and i spoke with a manager, he had informed me that my order was given to an Uber food delivery driver, and that they would remake my order. I agreed. the associate who gave my food away came up to apologize and offered me cookies? as a forgiveness? i informed him i just wanted my food so i could go. 10 more minutes in the restaurant and i was out the door. I will have to find another mcd's to go to from now on.",0
I ordered a snack size mcflurry and they gave me a regular mcflurry and charged me for the snack size. Absolutely disgusting behavior from mcdonald's. If I could give them negative stars I would.,0
Could not get their head out of their own ass. tried to order my kids one being a McChicken with extra lettuce and pickles. I got the grill and they put pickles on the grill pickles.The Griddle it took three workers and two managers to still that's my order and still messed up.,0
They were very slow. I literally waited 10 minutes on the drive thru. It was about 10 o'clock at night. I will not go to this one again.  Food was good but speed of service was horrible. ,0
"Good was good, but took 7 minutes to get me an iced coffee.",0
"This is the most fickle drive through.  Some days they are on point and it's in and out.  Days like today, they have you pull forward to wait for your food. Eleven minutes later you walk in to see what the hold up is, and the bag of your food is sitting there on the counter. Who knows how long it had been there for and how many minutes I wasted due to an incompetent employee who probably thinks they should be making $15 an hour.",0
"Worst customer service, manager actually rolled her eyes when I asked for a receipt, and told me that it's a giant pain in the ass, yeah that actually happened, their kiosk was allowing me to order food that they did not have and did not tell me this till I asked for the McRib and he's all we don't have that, I just ordered and payed for it...if I had not asked they would have never said anything about it. Stay Away! Unless you want to get rude service",0
"How this company hired a manager who doesn speak English? Food was cold and nuggets were stale cold fries,",0
The 2 for give dollar deal was bad. I ordered two quarter pounders and they we're left over from the past definitely not fresh from frozen do worst burgers I've had at any mc Donald's,0
Would have been nice to get some warm food and to not have to listen to the workers screaming and arguing through the hole meal.  Also could have lived w/o all the foul language the workers were using.  I will not be back!,0
"I ordered a bacon McGriddle with White American cheese. They gave me Swiss. I acknowledged them the issue they said they only have white American cheese and no other white cheese. They are currently advertising the mushroom and Swiss burger.. that a white cheese too I thought?

Or is the Swiss the only American cheese? Or does anyone not know the difference.

I need a manager. At least ask me if I want my food replaced with regular cheese.

So the McGriddle eventually was eaten ",0
"App sucks, don't work because the restaurant does not show order. Employees and management does not care and act like they don't speak English. Unprofessional",0
Poor guess service no one greeted or even said anything at the drive thru even tho they r drive thru only,0
Order two large fries both was burnt !! Not the frist time !! They will give nasty food when going threw the drive threw !!!,0
"I am tired of the inconsistency of this particular establishment. The first thing is that this is the only McDonalds in the area that starts serving breakfast at 3 am. It is next to a club and i am sure a burger sounds better after drinking, but anyway back to the inconsistency. I show up everyday at 2:45 am and sometimes i can get a qtr pounder and other days they say it's not on the late night menu. What really bugs me is that several time I am told breakfast only! No ody shows up at that time for a mcgriddle. Stop being lazy and make the food. Most of the breakfast is ready to slap together and is why they do it, but i show up before 3 am and I want a burger! Why can't the staff get their stuff together as i wrote this review 3 people drove off because they did not want breakfast either.",0
I ordered a burger and salad and they took 25 minutes to bring me my food. My entire lunch break was spent in the waiting area of the parking lot and looked like they didn't give me extra chicken on my salad as I paid for. Very disappointed.,0
"I ordered two combos on the uber eats my total was 30 dollars and when my food arrived two of the shakes I ordered where missing, I called the mcdonalds and they never answered. Be carful when you order so that your money does not go to waste",0
"Ordered the buttermilk crispy tenders and when approach the counter after I paid they said will not be available until dec 28 in exchange only offer a 6 pc chicken nuggets, really a 6 pc nuggets. Plus they took so long just to tell me that.",0
"Horrible! I hate to have to say that because I love Mc Donalds. No toilet paper no hand soap in the restroom and just plain dirty! When I told the manager she sent an employee to take care of it. I saw that he went in with the items and came back out and continued wirking with thebsame glives he used in the restroom Really? When I ordered they got the order wrong, no napkins in both napkin holders and no salt. In the dinning room most of the tables were dirty. The worst part is that they were not busy. Make it right please.",0
"The service here was very rude they are very nasty when it comes to customers like they dont want to work, they only talk in spanish what about the ones that dont understand. That's not good service. Needs new management!",0
"Got charged twice for a mobile order, and even when I went to get my curbside order, I ended waiting for 10 minutes and went to the side door, and even got disrespect from the manager of the store. Don't care how good their fries are, this just made me quit on Macdonalds all together.",0
This place is always unorganized.  Every time we Uber they send the order with missing food. The staff is rude most of the time and to top it of they never pick up their phone.  They need some serious training .,0
Service was fast but the guy at the window (Covered in tattoos) was drinking and sucking on his fingers while handling people's orders. The only reason I grab my order was because someone else prepared it.,0
This place can never get a drive thru order right.  Even told the manager 3 times that I wanted round eggs and not the folded ones.  Everytime I do a drive thru ordered it's messed up.  Never again will I go there.  They suck.  Sorry.  Corporate is in town and they will hear about this place.,0
Never go to this McDonald's it's the worst if u complain about something they complain back the staff is slow rude and unhigenic I saw three employees use the rest room and not wash there hands even the manager has an attitude,0
Same thing applies for any McDonald's short staff food is expensive and not prepared properly it seems like they cannot get the order right,0
Only one line was open and the food delivery people made it longer for the people ordering in line. I waited 30 mins in line!! I won't be doing that again!!!,0
A few minutes ago I placed an order and they gave me the wrong one and when I complained they responded with an unpleasant and nasty attitude.  The worst attention.,0
The guy who took my order was rude and tried to tell me a small meal isnt a thing. Not that long ago I worked at a mcdonalds. A small fry and a small drink with my san,0
It's unacceptable to have to wait in the drive-thru for 40 minutes just to order food,0
I ORDERED THE WHOLE MENU THEN I GOT FAT AFTER DONT RECOMMEND GOING HERE,0
Order taker was a wee bit friendlier but person who gave me my food never saud a word. Food luke warm but order was correct,0
"I understand that mistakes can be made, but when the order is done on Uber and you have the receipt and time to complete the order, how do you confuse a small Sprite for a tote of cookies?",0

Too much time waiting for a fast food,0
It crazy how You can ,0
"I dont know if this place is open. Everytime our company wants to make a big order, we call the number on the website and nobody ever answers the phone. They lost our business and respect. A business that does not feel that they need to answer their phones lacks customer service skills. I would not want to be the owner of this particular store, that is if the store is open, like I said, THEY NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE.",0
"Poor service, after waiting for 10 minutes to get my food, I left. No special order, and the people that ordered after me had their food brought to them. I left and went to KFC.",0
Ordered through the mobile app and it didn't go through was told they couldn't receive online orders.  Should have something through the app to let people know if a location can receive mobile orders or not.,0
The large milkshake i ordered was the size of a medium. If i had known that i never would have ordered it. Disappointed,0

All McDonald's are horrible. Always get bad service and the food is never quite what you expect. The only reason they're in business is because they are on the corner when you need them.,0

"The worst Mac Donald I have ever visited in my life the treatment of the staff towards the customers is totally despicable, you practically have to get the words out of it why they look at you and talk to you with contempt the food took 34 minutes exactly when the food finally arrived it was completely cold they didn't give me glasses they didn't put napkins they didn't put sauce. Not to mention the workers inside yelling at each other. A. I almost forgot, a client returned some hamburgers because it was not as he had ordered them, they opened them, they took out the vegetables and returned it to him, that is not allowed.",0
"The attention is not the best. I understand it's work under Strees, but if The Crew Leader teaches the public how to drive, they'll make a good team. This happens in most of this food chain.",0
"The attention was not good. Neither the cashier nor the one who gave me the happy meal were kind, I asked to change the toy because my son already had it and he responded in a bad way that there was no more.",0
"If you want to have an unpleasant time, go to the drive of this mcDonald's, they are all wrong from the first to the last and could it be that now the mcflury is just ice cream with a cookie sprinkle on top?",0
"God these McDonald's people don't want to work I've gone several times at 2 in the morning and they always tell me it's the breakfast menu, and when I check on Uber the menu is the regular menu, it's just that they don't t want to make my food, and there are several times that they have done it to me really that horrible.

I do not recommend this place at all, rather they should close it, I have gone several times at 2am to place my orders and they simply say that the menu they have is for breakfast and they never want to take out my order when I go at that time, and likewise with Uber eats orders. This place is really not worth it, very disappointed in the services of all the McDonald's staff who work there, they shouldn't have people like that...",0
"I ordered a cold brew frappe and they gave me a frozen Coke, I asked for long fries and they gave me half, all in Uber eat, lousy McDonald's and bad employers",0
"I have gone several times ""because it is the one that is closest to me"" and the truth is that they always give me the wrong order. 占쏙",0
Employee with bad attitude too long to wait to order,0
"I didn't like the service.
I did not like the service.",0
Bad service. They didn't even put me sauce and they delivered burnt cinnamon rolls.,0
"Well, the truth is that it has lost its quality and attention, very few employees do not recommend it",0
"Very bad service, I asked someone if they speak Spanish, they said no and then I speak Spanish, I won't go back there, what a disappointment in the service 占쏙",0
"This was a quick stop for a bite to tide us over with my a couple of the kids with us. We went thru the drive thru and even though it was slow business, we were put off to wait a couple of minutes and the assistant that took the order was very crisp and short in his interaction.He stated the price and told us to pay at the window where we were completely ignored for another several minutes while he (I'm assuming) took the order for the people behind us. When he finally took our payment and we moved forward to the window to receive our order, only half of the order was correct, and none of the condiments we requested were included. That kept us trying to get it sorted.
As a supervisor and a manager, I would hope review for management as well as employees could be considered in improving the atmosphere. It will be a place I will think twice before visiting again.
If you plan on stopping in, be prepared to take your time to make sure things are correct before leaving. Be accountable for your time if you want your order correct.",0
The lobby was absolutely disgusting. Trash and food all over the floor. Staff didn't even come to the front to take orders they just expect you to use the kiosk. The kiosk numbers were covered in sticky stuff. We asked a staff member a question and they flat out ignored us and walked away. I don't recommend this location.,0
The store was filthy. Employees were using profanities in the back where customers upfront could hear. Two female employees were playing on there phone. What a horrible experience.,0
"Went to pick up a mobile order at 3:45AM. Only option was to go through drive thru. I arrived and the drive through staff said they were closed despite the app and website saying they are a 24/7 location.

I paid in full through the app, and they said I wouldn receive a refund for an hour. I asked for the refund immediately and the clerk ignored me. Upset that they",0
"Lobby Hours 8 am- whenever they feel like locking the doors. I showed up at 7:10 pm FIFTY MINUTES BEFORE SCHEDULED CLOSING, TO ALL THE DOORS LOCKED. I am on foot because I'm staying at a nearby hotel. WALKED THROUGH FREEZING RAIN. In hopes of just getting something quick and going back to my hotel. THANKS FOR WASTING MY TIME!",0
"I was at this location on 2/5/23. Went through the drive-thru and the lady taking order was a little rude.  I drove off and went inside. Omg, the expo person was standing there drinking a soda as she's bagging  food. One of the cooks had so much hair, even  though  he had on a hat he needed a hair net as well. Went to get my drink, and I quickly changed my mind to a bottle of water. The drink station sickened me, I dared not get ice or a drink from there. Won't  be back, I'm sure you don't care. Most disgusting!!!!",0

"Waited 40 minutes in the drive-through line, only to have my fries be so over cooked that they were in-edible. 0 out of 5 stars",0
"Expect to wait 15-20 min for drive thru. Recieved our sweet teas at the window, and it had a bit of coffee taste. The person at the window sampled the tea and said it tastes like tea. NOT to us. Seemed very frustrated. She asked us what we would like. I told her Dr pepper, and before I could tell her the rest of the drink order, she rushes off and gets us 3 dr peppers. Then when we corrected her, she said we asjed for 3 dr peppers. This is my burger without onions and pickles. What you see on my fingers is grease from the burger. Good luck getting your food here.",0
"The truth is that I feel offended by the Mananger, he yelled at me as if I were his employee!  I really don't understand, I just asked him a question about an order that is already prepared and ready!  and he doesn't deliver it to me because he doesn't feel like it. I work as a delivery person for DoorDash. It's ridiculous to have to stand in line at the drive thru to get something that's already done, really, 0 star!  I work every night at that site and I have never had a problem with any of the cographers everyone is friendly and professional",0
"Ordered a few McDoubles and a 6 pc nugget kids meal. Asked for extra fries for the kids meal but was denied the request. Beef Patties were old on the McDoubles, nuggets were old and cold but there were plenty of customers so I don",0
"Service was slow. 3 cars went in the other lane before someone helped me in the drive-through.  My mocha tasted more like plain coffee, it had almost no flavor.",0
"It was bad enough when the dining room soda machine converted to the one nozzle machine, but they also did it to the drive thru. So now all their soda tastes nasty. I thought McDonald's was supposed to have great tasting sodas, not sodas that taste like suicides. Not to mention their staff can't figure out basic orders and there's a 90% chance your order is going to be wrong in some way. Added with the homless going up to every person, this spot used to be okay and nows it's more like the last resort.",0
"Worst McDonald experience to date.  Attempted to use drive-thru code at time of order, and was refused. Placed our order that would include the discount when code was applied. Pulled up to the window to a frumpy red-headed clown of an employee that promptly slammed the card reader through my window with nigh a word. I asked to have our discount code applied, and he begrudgingly got his scanner out to read the QR code, but he had wrung the order up incorrectly, so the discount was not applying. He requested assistance from his manager, and their solution was to add a second premium drink to the order at an up charge. All staff came across dower and melancholy. Even when I commented that I was concerned about the accuracy, and that this had been a terrible experience, I was ignored. I don know if they beat their employees on a regular basis to keep s羲?l ever go back to this location again.",0
Bathrooms were absolutely disgusting tampons on the ground before you walk into the building just really dirty,0
Can not even order food they were not even incompetent enough to make an order.,0
"I don know if they all hate their job but this was probably THE worst location I퐒e been to. One, they didn have my order correctly after telling them we were missing items they looked at me as if I was stupid. Second, their frie",0
There were 4 cars that were able to order at the drive thru and pull forward before the lady in my drive thru even got to me.,0
"DO NOT GO TO THIS MCDONALD'S UNLESS YOU SPEAK SPANISH!!!!  Every Sunday I go get breakfast for my brother.
Every time I order the same thing 2 burritos SMALL COFFEE WITH 4 SUGARS. They have not got the order right YET! Why cause everyone that works there is a Mexican that can't speak or read English.
I took back the coffee again cause the sticker & receipt 4 Sugar. I got coffee with 4 Creamer BECAUSE THEY CAN'T READ ENGLISH.",0
"Lobby ordering is only open M-F 11am-2pm. Without a car for drive up window or App, you are out of luck. I",0
"I didn't get a chance to try it. Went to pick up some McDonald's from this 24-hour location at 3:00 a.m. but no one would respond at the drive-thru speaker. When I drove up to the window the two gentlemen inside acted like they couldn't see me. I honked and waved my arms and it was clear that they could see me but they would not acknowledge my presence. Totally unacceptable and unprofessional. If you're under staffed or closed, put a sign on the door or at the drive-thru...",0
The only good thing about the location is it's cleanliness. I ordered at the kiosk and took a table number for dine in. They didnt being me my food. I had to grab in from the counter. Defeats the purpose of using table numbers. Then the employee tried to hold my drink from me. Had to tell him I had in fact ordered the drink he took away. When I unwrapped the burger it was slanted a good 60. How hard is it to stack a sandwich? Staff don't ,0
If you order at the desk you feel like they're bothered. They don't display any type of customer service at all. When I get a mcflurry they don't mix it or even fill it anywhere near the top. Steer clear.,0
This has to be the worst McDonalds! The food is never hot and never fresh.  I went there again tonight since it's the only place open.   The fries were warm and tasted like they had been cooked in an air frier and the burger was cold and tasted like it had been sitting for hours.   This places stays pretty busy so there is no excuse for poor quality of food imo.   Avoid unless it's your only option.,0
"Next time I'll just tell them to suprises me, they never get my order right anyway 占쏙",0
"The tomato on the hamburger tasted FUNKY tonight, really gross. And chicken nuggets were stale and cold.",0
Says it's 24 hours and was turned away at about 3 am. Don't say you are 24 hours if you are not a 24 hour location. What do you not understand about being a 24/7 location???,0
Waited in line 20+ minutes only to get someone else's order and no way to get our correct order because they don't answer the phone and they're too busy. Super irritating.,0
"They have the worse customer service, and there food is never fresh. Even if you ask for fresh food they still give you non fresh food, and they have the ugliest attitude",0
If you going to close the lobby despite being listed as open 24 hours at least don't ignore people walking up to order at the drive thru on foot!,0
Google says they are open 24 hours. They guy in the drive through turned us away at 3:30 am and told us they close at 2:00,0

Cold food usually and missing orders constantly. Any other McDonald,0
"Wow! For starters, the place was trashed. Litteraly every single table was dirty, and the floor need to be swept badly. Had to go up and ask for lids because they had not stocked anything in the lobby. I willing to give places like this a second chance if I see effert... But I saw none from the staff. It was not remotely busy and staff still did virtually nothing to improve the cleanliness of the lobby. Needless to say I will not be returning.",0
"Not open for pedestrians until 11am. I had to queue up with my legs, as if I were a car. When I got to the screen, noone answered me - guess it only responds to humans in cars. Helpful staff inside directed me to order this way, but it didn't work. If you don't have a car, don't bother!
Still reeling from the embarrassment 占쏙",0
The absolute worst location. The people are rude and order has been wrong the last 4x I,0
"Worst experience ever!! First the cashier gave me attitude about using the app for the $1 large fries, he sighed when I showed it to him. Then said in a rude tone that I need to show him the bar code (in the past I just show them the number and they type it in) Then literally rolled his eyes when I told him it was Apple Pay and said 퐓hatever?Then stared at me after taking the Apple Pay, so I figured I would get the receipt at the next window. I pulled up to the next window and they told me the other guy has thrown the receipt away. Got home, looked to see how much I was charged and he did not apply the app discount to the fries.  My fries that I had ordered well done,  both large and medium were cold and soft (I live a block away) the nuggets were old and the cheeseburger bun was not soft. I was there today, a Sunday at 6 pm ( dinner time, things shor charged for cold, not fresh food",0
"A lot of stores are Really slow with their service. What bothers me more, is that no 2 McDonald has the same rules. Is the lobby open today? Or at this hour? At this store? Plus not all have a pickup. Especially no pickup for Door Dash. They make us go inside",0
"Well earlier today. I placed 2 separate orders, but when I arrived there doors were locked, there was no letter or any sort of notice explaining why, but what confuses me more is they had people inside ordering and sitting down inside not happy with that location!!",0
"OK, I guess I need to stop going to ANY Mcdonalds.  Was in a hurry and ordered a double cheese and a small order of fries.  They have two pickup windows and I watched both windows handing out food.  So when the line moved up I drove to the furthest window.  and sat, and sat and watched 4 other cars pick up their food at the window behind me.   a good 5 minutes passed and I backed up to the window where the food was being handed out and the person, basically, THREW the food at me without a word.  10 steps... 10 steps to bring me my food or something... but nothing.  And then  the fries were cold and the bun on the burger was stale.   You get what you pay for and you get what you deserve if you go to a Salt Lake McDonalds.",0

"This restaurant is advertised as 24 hours. I waited over 10 minutes in the drive through, with at least 5 other cars, only to have no response from the speaker. Then, they shut the lights off, and still no communication. Staff was seen inside working, but no attempt was made to tell waiting customers that they were refusing to serve them.",0
Only the drive through is open 24 hrs. Walk in only open until 8 pm,0
Was missing the hash browns from my meals which made my 12 hr drive back to Canada v v sad ,0
Employees were slovenly. One employee had her boyfriend behind the counter whispering in her ear instead of taking our order. Took 10 minutes to get a diet coke,0
"Lobby was closed with no sign or reason why, no curbside spots and super long drive thru wait. Attempts to call to see why lobby was closed but no one would answer the phone.",0
"Went to this location and went through and the first thing that happened is someone started moaning in the mic. Then we ordered 2 large fries and 1 small fry, and they tried to say we ordered 2 large drinks and a small fry it was ridiculous. They were to busy making inappropriate sounds instead of doing their job. If I could give less then one star I would. Will NOT ever come here again.",0
"I wanted these guys to be better than the other locations nearby, but they are all the same. Open your lobby. It 8 pm. 25 car lines waiting for AT LEAST 20 minutes is horrible. All McDonal",0
Do not order from here there was a hair in my soda!,0
"Does not attend to the needs of a driver delivering food as they make you wait through the drivethru when the order is ready sitting on the counter while you're 10 Cars back. Food is getting cold and they expect you to wait and then deliver this cold food to the customer when you finally get it? What a lousy way of attending drivers, new employees or new management is much needed for this joke of a restaurant.",0
This location is a joke. There a whole line all The way out in the street and we have all b,0
So there is no way to get food from this McDonald unless you are driving in a vehicle?You have an entire lobby that could be fulfilling the orders of patrons without vehicles or staying in your nearby hotels,0
I went to walk in the lobby and the doors were locked 20 minutes before closing time. Horrible customer service!,0
"This restaurant has to learn how to treat delivery driver professionally and properly. I went picking up an order and wait in the drive through for 35 minutes, and it ended with them telling me they couldn make the order because they turned off the screen! The only reason they couldn fulfill the order is because of their laziness because I have seen other McDona",0
"Working a graveyard shift in the area, I thought of grabbing a quick bite while on a quick break. Pulling into the drive-thru, after vehicles in front have ordered, female worker mumbled something about their system 퐑pdating?and asked to wait. As I waited for a few moments, she then rudely told me that it was still updating and couldn take my order, even though she took an order ahead of me. I asked how long it would take, but no answer was given. I asked again, she continued to say it was updating and that she couldn take my order. I finally started putting in a mobile order to make it easier on their end, but she got back on again and rudely said 퐃o while their system updated. So I decided to leave to find another place to grab a quick bite, only to hear her say that she did mention they were closed if I were listening to her.

Another driver in the other stall was having the same issue with another male employee, but was actually nice enough to let them know they were temporarily closed until further notice.

Clear unprofessional attitude from this female employee. Definitely needs to be taught better in respect and in having better customer service skills. Guess when you get paid minimum wage, I폻 be miserable too. Bu",0

"This location took really long to process orders and get their line moving. I even had a mobile order, and at about 10:15pm I had to take the drive through. Took 20 minutes. They kept putting the wrong order on the screen at the ordering area. Guy who talked to me was pretty rude when I tried to let him know what was going on. Pretty sure it the gentleman in a tie that gave me my receipt.",0
Trash. Customer service is trash.   I'll never want mcdonalds for real.  Been 3 weeks since tomorrow.,0
I wanted to order but they didn't have a curbside option and they weren't open for dining in. A bunch of people tries going through the drive thru but because we didn't have cars they wouldn't even talk to us. There were a lot of other customers too.,0
"Posting this review in hopes that someone sees it. My number one complaint is the hours listed; it says 24hrs but that is not true. I'm not sure when they actually close, but I've been there at midnight, way later around 2am and 3am, and they're closed. The funny thing is that there's usually someone inside to tell me that they're closed.. I don't mind that they close early, but they need to correct their hours if that's the case. I frequently get off work rather late and I'm usually pretty hungry, I can go somewhere else but this location ~would~ be convenient for me for how close it is to my work. It's also frustrating that they allow me to pay on the app and then not get my food. Please adjust your hours online and on the app so people like me don't get their hopes up.",0
Drive through. Asked [by manager?] to pull to the side and wait 5 minutes for apple pies to finish cooking. No problem. Received 80% of my order after those 5 minutes. Both sandwiches handed to me cold. Said he forgot 1 of my drinks and he폻 brb. 25-30 MINUTES LATER AND NO ONE IS ANYWHERE?I circle through drive through again and ask to speak to the first guy - I just want my drink and the missing sauces. He MIA? The gentleman who help,0
"I want the word to go out about James at this location. He is the worst manager ever! And to the Watson group that owns this location, I'm going to make sure that I spread the word not to visit this location because of James. We waited over 10 minutes because you had only one drive thru open and things were going slow. Well the clock just turned to 11 and we wanted breakfast. They told us no. Even though we were in line long before then and it is not our fault that everything was going slow. I called James and I was upset. I didn't swear but instead of him understanding how this would be frustrating, he just kept giving excuse after excuse and then whined that he wasn't going to talk anymore and hung up on me. Like I said, I didn't swear but I let him know that it was rude how they treat people. IF I CAN GIVE ZERO BECAUSE OF JAMES, I WOULD! Learn to understand your customers. Until then,  everyone stay away from here!",0
"Trash was overflowing, Coke dispenser was out of syrup and worst of all my hamburger was raw. Not a good experience.",0
This is my first time eating at this location but probably might try it again for a better review but nothing about my meal was normal except for all the lettuce falling out of my big Mac nothing was excessively old but just seemed like they have us stuff that was about time to get thrown away none of my food was hot it was semi warm the nuggets weren't the greatest I don't waste food so I still ate it but I will give this location another shot to see if i can get better food for the price I a paid,0
"Hit or miss with this on. On some occasions the service is good, but mostly bad. One Saturday morning myself and another car pulled up to the drive thru and waited for almost 2 minutes. I pulled forward and went inside got my order and as I was leaving saw the other car just pulling up to the pick up window.  Food is typically warm not hot
9/18/22 sat at the drive in while they took 3 cars from the other lane after telling me they would be right with me.   Left without ordering most likely won ",0

Drive through staff will short you $5-10 dollars worth of food almost every time. Very slow service.,0
Took them forever to come to the register to take our order and then they let our bag of food sit there forever before they gave it to us. Not happy with our services at all.,0
30 minutes in the drive through... again.,0
Really bad experience. We went through the drive through at night and ordered two chocolate shakes. We paid. Got to the pickup window and the lady told us they didn have chocolate shakes and asked us if we wanted vanilla or our money back. We told her we wanted our money ,0
"I was on my pedal bike in drive thru...as I have done a countless other locations. A lady come on the speaker and told me the wait time was going to be 25-30 minutes. It was late, I just got off work, and was hungry, so I didn't mind. I wanted some McDonald's! I placed my order and then she told me they do not accept walk-ups. I told her I am on a bicycle, not a walk-up. She told me she was cancelling my order. Needless to say, no McDonald's that night, and now the company has lost my business.",0
No idea what time the lobby actually closes but 6:30 pm is a bit early. So headed to the drive through with everyone else and by the time I got my food it was already cold.,0

These was the 2nd time I had this problem with the same McDonald's. I was hoping that the first time just some kind of mistake. So I fell for it twice.  And at the redickuless price they get like $4 for like 1/4 of a potato. 10 lb for that price in the store.  It will not be happening again! No more fries from this place!!! And all over 1 cents worth of salt. Lmao,0
The Hispanic females there were putting hair in people's food,0
"I walked there. Would not let me order at the window. I don't see a problem taking an order if you aren't in a vehicle. You get the money before you make the order. And the lady was very rude to me, she slammed the window on me and wouldn't even say for example, our policy doesn't allow us to serve unless you're in a vehicle, sorry, or something of that sort, s hi e was very poorly trained. Remember you do serve the public a n d McDonald's isn't my favorite. It was convinient. It is unhealthy for you. Probably live longer because I never got their food. I'll never go there again.",0
"Dining room was closed with no sign indicating it was. Called to inquire why it was, and female employee was incredibly rude. When I asked why the dining room was closed she gave me a lot of attitude, and said ""Uh, because it is? Because we don't have enough people?"" As if that should have been obvious (again, there was no sign) That woman needs to learn how to speak to people with respect.",0
We퐒e gone through three times now and it just seems like the person who taking your order is n,0
"Go to another nearby location and you'll get better service. All the employees are nice except for one. The trans woman who works nights is ALWAYS SO RUDE, she's the reason I don't go to this location anymore. She goes out of her way to make it so you can't use coupons from the app as well. For example the buy one get one free for quarter pounder, big mac, etc. It can only be used when the sandwiches are rung in not in a meal, she knows this and purposely puts 1 in a meal so that your coupon won't work and when you ask to have it removed from the meal she says no so you have to pay double. Always an attitude. Go to another location nearby.",0
"So as of late, the past month or so, they close the store randomly to save face and not overwhelm the low count of night staff they have. It's 1230 in the morning, no line and the kid working says it's going to take an hour.  When I knownfor a fact it takes about 10 to 15 min. I had placed an order on the app using my free points. Looking to get a quick bite on my Sunday night walk home from my usual business and now I'm down from 2600 points to 100 points...AND STILL HUNGARY!!!! Yall lucky you get a 2 star.. update I now have 1600 points O.o. yall need to properly train your staff and quite frankly I think you should just overhaul the entire place with new staff because what you have now..SUX!",0
I am most certainly not lovin it.,0
"They didn't have fries or ice cream. Let's be honest though, we already knew the second one.",0
Horrible customer service. They ignore their customers when clearly standing in line.,0
Ordered a Chocolate Shake and they gave me a mixture of chocolate and mint. I drove back and asked them to fix it. They made me wait 5 minute and gave me a mixture of mainly vanilla ice cream. When I asked they told me thay the machine was not working right! What a ripoff!,0
I can't remember the time I got good fries from them.   Once in a while there are good employees there that make up for it but I have simply dropped this place from my list of places to go after the last few times I've eaten there.  I should say this is for all McDonald's,0
Literally had two homeless people come to my car while ordering. One of them tried to open my door on the passenger side. The other one reached inside. I am a grown man. This spooked me. Never again will I go to this location.,0

"So my boyfriend and I ordered a large fries and 2 large drinks. We get to the window to pay l Had a coupon on the app for the large fries. Then I was paying for the rest on venmo. The girl at the register had no idea what she was doing. She had the assistant manager come help her she had no idea what she was doing... Then the manager came and we had now told them over 7 times to just take off the drinks... The manager still had a hard time....
How hard is it to take 2 drinks off an order.
He then was trying to say we had to pay for the fries. He eventually just let us have the fries for free. We also had a second order with another large fries. (we had 2 phone's with Free fries)
They were all rude and didn't care about us at all.
0/5 stars",0
"Really didn't care much for the area...

Homeless people in and outside of this restaurant. (Not that I dont like them) but made me feel very uncomfortable eating meal with my small child. The lady that took my order overcharged me.... The food tasted great. Even put a Happy meal toy with my big Mac .. but I'm not complaining everyone loves Olaf!  Restaurant has recently been remodeled and seemed fairly clean. I probably won't go back. But it was okay.",0
Worst McDonald on this planet! Don order to go the drive through is faster! The,0
We were visiting. From out of town and came through the drive through for some breakfast. The bacon egg and cheese biscuit was so hard it must have been under the warming light for hours!! It was impossible to eat. My sausage mcmuffin was so dry - not at all what I am used to and I order these regularly. After getting to our hotel room (less than 10 minutes from there) and finding out how terrible our breakfast was we called to let the manager know. Not only did she insinuate that we were lying but was less than professional by far. I have not complained to a fast food establishment for over 4 years. So when I feel food is this substandard and take time out to call I would have expected some common courtesy not an ignorant attitude especially from management. Needless to say when I come back this way I will not be eating at this location. If I were you I wouldn't either!! ,0
Went to eat there tonight and no one was there. It says that you guys are open 24 hours drive thru only but no one was there at the kiosk or at the windows. So please update your business hours.,0
Man. This. Location. Sucks. So. Bad.,0
"Since I work graveyards I unfortunately have to rely on McDonald's for food sometimes. I recently started trying to come here since the 7th east location is no  longer open 24 hours. Every time they've been closed for cleaning. If you're going to close update your hours so I don't waste my time driving all the way to you only to have to drive all the way to 2100 south.

Maybe you should stop paying starvation wages and you'd be able to hire an extra hand to help clean lol.",0
Watch out for the homeless people in the drive through. Shirtless guy will walk right up to your window and tell you to go F yourself if you don't buy him food.,0
"We went through the drive thru and to start it took too long for anyone to come over the speaker and then they were quiet and hard to understand. One of the things we ordered was ""a number two"". He was asked what size he wanted and what to drink as part of the order. They didn't give us fries with our combo meal and when the manager FINALLY noticed me he gave us a medium fry not the large we ordered.",0
I love nothing more than McDonalds fries. It hard to imagine that anyone comes to McDonald,0
Tried to order before hitting the airport; they asked us to wait a few minutes. We left after 20 without hearing another word.,0
"They charged me for a medium drink for my nieces happy meal, didn't ask for a medium drink. The guy who handed me my food barely acknowledged we were there at the window. He practically threw our food in our window while not even looking. Almost dropped our drinks. He was just shoving our food and drinks out his window blindly. I asked him why we had a medium drink he said he didn't know because it was all automatic. The cashier didn't give us our receipt so I asked him if I could get a copy of my receipt. He stormed off and comes back about a minute later shoves the receipt in my face and tells me if I want a copy of my receipt I need to ask at the first window. I just wanted to know about the medium drink otherwise I wouldn't have needed a copy of my receipt or if the cashier would have given me one I wouldn't have had to ask. Worst McDonald's I have ever been to. Never making that mistake again.",0
Service was quick but the person taking my order was completely unprofessional and not accommodating at all. Horrible service. When asked for my drink I stated 퐃alf coke....?the lady cut me off and aggressively said ,0
"After a few unsuccessful visits, I have the impression you'll be served if the staff happen to feel like it.",0
I was staying next door at the hotel and decided to stop in for breakfast sandwich and the sandwich was nasty wasn't cooked. But my #1 reason for the one star is the way the manager spoke to her worker in front of customers this was on 9/23/2019. I was like WOW really... Talk to people the way you would want to be spoken to. If you want to be rude talk to the person in the back. But otherwise learn to be a better manager that was unacceptable.,0
"I'm sorry. But half the people working here dont have a clue whats going on. 98% of the time I come here, they forget something. Its unbelievable. No other fast food chain has as many issues as any McDonald's does. Blows my mind. And these people want raises? Learn how to do your job if you want a raise.",0
This McDonalds is a joke. What they fail to mention on their hours of operation is at Midnight is that they are not able to take any Orders because their system is updating for at least 45min. Never heard of any other McDonalds closing down just to update. It would be nice if they stated that on google so people don't waste their time and gas for nothing.,0
This has GOT to be the worst McDonald in America. I live next ,0
"We went on Friday night around 11:30, and it was slow. We waited in like for 20 minutes then waited for our order and even to get to the window for thirty minutes. The people on the window and intercom were beyond rude. like i understand you're busy, but you DO NOT need to be rude to your customers, reguardless how busy you are.",0
This place is slloowwwwww,0
"Good  service, but I had told the waitress   not to take my tray and that.... I had to go out to get a portable battery for my phone. Upon doing so, the security officer harassed me about smoking when I had not lit my smoke.i then waited for his instructions when he started to speak  it was in espaniol and he pointed toward the street. I was somewhat confused and a bit worried about my LG. Coffee and a set of gloves.so my question  is why. Make your restaurant so user friendly and then harass it's patrons after a good dining experience?",0
They forget everything and charge you for it,0
"Called to confirm I could order using the app and walk up to pick up my order as I am staying at a hotel nearby. Other McDonalds just bring it to you outside the door when the lobby is closed.

They just hung up on me and kept the phone off the hook!! Wow - now that customer service; they won",0
"They mixed up my order in the drive thru with someone else's and gave me the wrong food. I guess that's what I get for not checking my bag until I drove 20 minutes home, and for eating at McDonald's in the first place.",0
Do not go here! My family came here on Christmas Eve and had the worst experience! We stayed at a hotel and wanted some nice hot chocolate and cookies and the cookies were hard as a rock and the hot chocolate was disgusting! It was hot water with peppermint. On top of it the customer service was awful. They refuse to take your order and make you do it on their machines. If u have questions too bad. We went back three times and they still got it wrong. Just save your time and do not go here!,0
"Was craving a breakfast sandwich, but they stopped selling those all day. Then I shifted to a chicken sandwich, but they only sell the spicy version now. Sadly, I drove away with no food...",0
"The old standby of a 1/4lb. w/cheese, fries and a coke was a disappointment. A warmed over hamburger patty that wasn warm enough to melt the chee",0
Frys were cool and soggy. The double quarter pounder w/cheese was slapped together were one beef paddy going one way and the other one going the other. It was stuck that which made it hard to eat.,0
This is more of a homeless shelter than a McDonald's,0
"First and last time to this McDonald's. Had to stand around for 20 mins aside from only 2 people being there. One employee caught an attitude when i asked for no pickles. None of the burgers were wrapped right. And they were so lazy about they job that at first they wouldn't even come to the register to take my order. Kept staring at me expecting me to use their damn machine.
Customer service and being polite goes a long way ladies! And learn how to wrap your food.",0
I ordered 2 big macs. They had no meat. No patties. Seriously?,0
This place is very dirty the employees are very rude. They got mad cause we asked for ketchup. Then we stayed in to eat and the employees are talking and putting down all the customers. They have been putting the men and lady's in the same bathroom cause the men's is closed and then my daughter went to use the bathroom the lady up front said there is 2 men in there cause there is closed. So she went in then the security guard need to use it and then the employees where talking about my daughter I went up there and told them that If they would take better Care and clean your place it would be up. Plus you have food over every where they don't wash there hands they don't clean the tables then you ask for a wash cloth to clean they say we don't have any clean. There is so many drug dealers here even the workers are sale I ng inside in the lobby in the parking lot.. I will never come here again I'm also calling the cops on the drug deals I seen. Even with a security guard on duty he just looks the other way.. DO NOT EVER COME HERE,0
"Yo real talk...... this mcdonalds convinced me to never give mcdonalds another dollar for the rest of my life.....

Last place in all categories.... WOW",0
"Ordered a bacon, egg and cheese biscuit meal, and they give me no bacon! They did send me 2 complimentary meals which was great. I go back with the free coupon and they gave me a chicken sandwich when I ordered a signature burger. Called their office to let them know and they did not care. Now I call Corporate in Chicago, how do you like me now????",0
"The worst drive thru service I've ever had anywhere. From the time I started paying attention to how long I was waiting in line til the time I was given my food was 48 mins. At least 10 mins before that I was waiting in line not paying attention to how long I'd been there.  So roughly an hour to get my food. Then only to be treated rudely  by the cashier, because somehow I was supposed to know they wanted cash only. Not sure why, since I had no choice but to run my debit card and it went through just fine and in a normal amount of time. I'll never go there again. I'll drive a few mins to another location.",0
"I don't go to McDonald's often but I've been here twice in the last year, both times were terrible. I went through the drive through both times. One time during the lunch hour, I didn't  get one of my burgers. I got the rest of a meal but the quarter pounder never made it  in the bag. I didn't know until I got home. Tonight I waited 20 minutes, no exaggeration, to get 1 burger from the line. I will never go here again I should have just driven home to eat. It would have been faster.",0
"this place sucks. two of the employees were yelling at each other, super immaturely. the store was disgusting, it took forever to order, and even longer to get our food. like I said, the management sucked. the employee he was arguing with just quit on the spot, saying ""I'm outta here"" and just left after being asked to do his job. entertainment value is five stars, quality is one star.",0
"10/11/2018 - Zero stars if offered. Employees and superiors lack customer satisfaction service.
Because employees follow lead of supervisors, can do attitudes are can't and won't.
In regards of coffee and soft drinks, we were told it is 'their policy ' to not offer refills due to high levels of homeless.
(What an awful thing to say.)
The restrooms are locked. To exit restrooms, one must know (we did not) to press a button in order for the door to unlock.
Definitely not the McDonald's for us. We would not be surprised if higher management reads this review then ultimately 'bar' us from their establishment even though we shall not return to this McDonald's location.",0
"So incredibly slow once the bars closed and the drunks got hungry. Fries were old, not hot. Disorder with the 2 drive through lanes. 3 cars in the outside lane back to back to back ordered (2 if those cars should have been behind my order) while our car (knowing what we were ordering, given we had at least 20 minutes waiting in line just to get to the ordering board/microphone speaker) sat at the menu for over 5 minutes waiting to order. Overall, our drive-through wait time was forty, YES 40!!!, minutes. Will NOT go there again. Also the frequent harassment made by the half dozen homeless people begging for either money, cigarettes, food, or to wash our Windows. Clearly, they should have picked up on our lack of patience at that point and left us the %@#! Alone. McDonalds staff or management should fix that problem for others as well.",0
"I am highly enraged with their service. They didn't specify on their signs in the parking lot that I couldn't leave the parking lot for more than five minutes. They booted my truck and I had to pay him with my food in hand. I've tried talking to the store manager, McDonald's main office and submitted a complaint. All I get it's the run around, hung up on and berated. I'm not much for posting these kinds of things, but I'm out money I feel wasn't owed, and feel highly taken advantage of.",0
There was blood on the womens bathroom toilet I told the old cashier and she said o well! I tried talking the manager and she completely ignored me I tried calling the number on my receipt 4 different times and everytime I got a busy signal. My daughter and I were standing off to the side waiting for our drinks and thank god after seeing the kitchen area we did not order food I was completely and utterly disgusting!!!!! Please do not go to this McDonalds! I rated it 1 star only because I had to rate it to leave this to bad!!,0
"McDonalds was fine; the people I went with sucked. But honestly this place is really sketch, they even have a security guard at the front door in case things go sideways. If you are wondering HOW things could go sideways, you wouldn't have to expand your view further then the amount of druggys that go to this McDonalds. Half of them don't even buy anything, they just stand around (to heat up I presume) waiting for the security to kick them out. The other half stand in line and figure out that they can't buy anything at the front desk then leave. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with this if they kept to themselves like everyone else ordering something at the McDonald's, but they would  randomly yell, ask questions, pan handle, and just were being a general nuisance. I understand that an establishment can't control who their costumers are, so it's not exactly the MD's fault, but still this Micky D's should be avoided at all costs for that reason. I give them 2 stars instead of one because the good customer service and magically clean bathroom. Seriously these cashiers have to deal with a lot of weird stuff and they somehow aren't mentally broken by the end of the day. I went at 11 at night which probably affects my review, but from the first impression I'm not inclined to go again to find out how it is in the day unless it was simultaneously the only restaurant, I was starving more than a communist in the gulag, and I lost my ability to cook food myself. Seriously don't go here it's horrible.",0
"Zero customer service skills. They don't even acknowledge yor presence. You talk to them and besides taking your order and your money, they don't even thank you for shopping there.",0
"I don't like cold fries. No one does. When a sign says Customer Parking only, does that exclude customers 10 minutes into the future? I have waited longer than that in this location's drive-through. I had a combo stop to make. Pick up some rum and bring home some dinner for me and the wife. I parked at McDonald's and walked the 65 seconds or so to the liquor store. A purchase and the return voyage took all of five minutes. By the time I had returned, there was a boot on my car. The person responsible for this was in the parking lot and informed me that to be considered a McDonald's customer, I would have had to make my fast-food purchase first, and then been given  30 minutes in the parking lot. It's a cold November evening. Fast food sitting in a car would be cold by the time I had returned, so I did things in what seemed like the logical order. $90 later, I was too disgusted to eat. I went into the store to file a complaint, but was bullied out by the towing staff. This isn't a predatory company per se, but they're in bed with one.",0
Literally the worstMcD's in the world. Going through drive thru she gave us our drinks and told us to pull forward by door...then blocking the person behind us from getting out. We took initiative and parked in th he drive thru spot. Husband then went in to find out what was happening...defeating the point of drive thru. He said the staff were abysmally slow taking forever to put each item in the bag. We were starving but only ate a little. I've never had McDonald's where grease runs down your arms and the fries were revoltingly greasy too. Surprisingly none of us got food poisoning.,0
"I was driving through the area with a friend and had to settle for this McDonald's after an hour and a half search for an open location that would serve me. However, I found out this location also did not have a working ice cream machine. How can all the machines be down in a city at once? This is some terrible service. My drive thru order taker was rude and had no idea how to process a cash payment. The driving lanes are also an apparent problem for the usual people coming here at night as two vehicles swerved into me and attempted to go in front of me in order to exit while I was at the ordering spot.",0
"Poor slow service an older man came to my table showed me words on his phone saying I had 30 minutes to finish my food and leave.
I asked the cashier about the Man and he claimed he is security and that even though I had paid for my items I could only be there 30 minutes.
I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told there was not one on duty that day. I then asked for corporate office phone number and was told they don't have it.
Very rude way to treat anyone at all.",0
"The bathroom was disgusting. Someone had left a mess in one of the stalls and bloody tissues by the sink (biohazard). I let someone know to come clean it but she just came in, looked at it and left. I was in a hurry with three children, so we had to cycle through using one stall and there was a constant line forming behind us. If my kids didn't have to go so badly, we would have gone somewhere else. I would never stop there again.",0
"If I could I would give them 0 stars!!!!!!!!!!

Currently McDonalds is doing a buy one get one for a dollar. 10 piece McNuggets, quarter pounder with cheese and a Big Mac! Instead of just charging me what a normal 10 piece and then add a 1$ for a second one they made me pay 3$ more for a 20",0
Could you update the lobby hours? It seems to change every two weeks. With the pandemic going on the least you can do is not waste anyone's time.,0
The service was good. Got through the driveway quickly with the right order but as I was leaving a homeless person tried running towards me screaming at my dog,0
Dining room closes at 8pm.,0
Staff was unfriendly and food tasted old. The fried onions on my signature hamburger tasted burnt. We had just got out of a concert and they were busy but our fries tasted like they had been sitting around for 20 - 30 minutes. It was gross,0
"Horrible service, the drive through associates just ask you what else they can get for you. I literally told them that all 4 times and could hear other employees laughing ",0
Ordered their signature Double BBQ Burger tonight at the drive thru... One patty wasn't even cooked.... The buns were burnt black instead of toasted. Fries came out cold. My wife ordered a #6 Chicken Nuggets with BBQ sauce.... Didn't get her sauce and nuggets were cold as well. HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!,0
The employees at this location threaten my sister in-law because she asked for a happy meal she ordered but didn't get. The manager needs to hire people who don't threaten their customers.,0
"Seriously this is the absolute worst service I've ever had. The manager, is lazy and we sat in the drive thru for 15 damn minutes. We pulled up to the first window, and he opens the window and sits there talking and completely ignored us. Then we pay and pull up to the 2nd window and literally, 3 employees are sitting there talking. We're at 15 minutes and counting and still sitting at the 2nd window. All for 2 hash browns and a sandwhich.",0
"The drive through is open during construction but the it took almost 15 minutes of waiting at the window, then the manager handed me the food and drink while loudly arguing with a co-worker about how they don't like working together. No apology for the long wait. Won't go back to that location again.",0
"We came to eat McDonalds to have a lovely meal as friends in the evening of June 3rd. We were informed that we were not allowed to order chicken nuggets because it was 폹reakfast time? When we got back to our place we were extremely disappointed to find our large fries container was half full, cold, and had no salt whatsoever, My sausage egg biscuit was missing the",0
"At first glance the place looks good but the first quarter pounder was cold and when I watched them fix the second I found the the commercial about being cooked fresh is bs. They pulled the meat from a drawer and it was barely warmer than the first. Then the flies inside were all over everything. Yuk... the last time I will come here. Right before I left a guy came in and tried to get some water and a rude sweaty security guard was stopping him. Wow, this place is not where I would take family.",0
Fifteen minute wait in the drive through. They don't pull cars aside with larger orders to keep the line moving. Predatory booting person roaming the lot... You'll probably be more comfortable with police supervising the exchange if you happen to get booted.,0
So 4:20 in the morning obviously means something else to this McDonald's.  No coffee made up. The jerk at the window couldn't have been more rude and put off that we were there.  Today we were up early to start our long drive home after what was a very nice weekend in Salt Lake City.  If this is the impression McDonald's wants to leave the. I am happy to never frequent any of their establishments.  15 minutes from the time we paid til the we got our food in the drive through and two cars behind us got theirs ahead of us.  All we ordered were two cokes and two sausage biscuits.,0
"Spent over 20 minutes in line to be told that only serve breakfast at 2am, even though their menu said lunch also.  Then told they were out of almost everything.  Don't waste your time going here at night.  I've gone two separate times and had seriously awful experiences.  Don't go here, there's a Denny's near by, and several gas stations with better service and better food.",0
Picture a mcdonalds in a pretty rough area. They have a security guard. You need permission to go in the bathroom. People are begging. Seems dirty. You can't expect it to be the best one. The staff seem friendly for the most part and my food comes out fairly fast tastes decent . I have noticed the buns are stale slightly around the edge at this location more than once. I haven't had that happen at any others really. I wonder why that is?,0
"I understand you're under construction but your employees are ridiculous. The employee that shuttles the money was one his cell phone the entire time. I gave him a $10 and told him I had the correct change but he just walked off, still on his phone. Also, if I order and pay for a medium fry, I don't want a small amount in a medium container just thrown in the bag.",0
Horrible experience. Waited for over 30mins in the drive thru to have them forget part of our order. Not to mention they couldn figure out ,0
"This McDs SUCKS. Their food is disgusting and their service sucks. They forgot my kids entire happy meal and when they brought it out there was no toy and no chicken nuggets. We ordered sundaes to go and they delivered it to a random table and took some other guys marker. And to top it all off they were RUDE, like it was my fault they suck at their job. This is the absolute WORST experience I've ever had at a restaurant ever.",0
"We were going to the Children's museum & my granddaughter wanted McDonald. Apparently at this location they will only take your order in the drive-thru. We had to call over the counter for help. We were told that we had to order from the kiosk. I explained to them that I had cash. They told me that I still needed to order from the kiosk & then pay cash at the counter...what...then why won't they just take my order??? Then we had to call over the counter a 2nd time because we were struggling with the kiosk. The lady that came out said I had to order my meal a la carte...what!!! Needless to say, we walked out & will  NEVER return!!! If it's such an inconvenience to take people's orders inside maybe they should close the lobby at this location & only have the drive-thru. From the way people were treated while I was there & reading other reviews apparently the customers inside real do NOT matter. I'm surprised that McDonald's would allow a location (franchise) to treat customers this way.",0
I went to order Sweet and Spicy glazed tenders. I said it numerous times and the drive through kept asking what sauce I wanted. Should be obvious Sweet and Spicy  glaze . I left there and went to McDonald's on 1700 S.  Redwood Road . Much better service and food is what I ordered.,0
"This Store is the highest priced store, probably the most unfriendly and unprofessional in Utah. The heavy set Hispanic lady at the counter had just taken an order from the young man a head of me and would not take my order. She was going to make me do my order on the kiosk. When I told here no, that I would go somewhere else before I would do that, she told me goodbye. Yes, I am done with mcdonalds. You are not getting another dime of my hard earned money ever. if you continue these business tactics I will be happy to hear you are in bankruptcy. Enjoy the time you have left. Just a side note I have been going to this mcdonalds for over 3 years at least one day per week. Never again! Good thing Wendy's right around the corner was more than happy to take my order and my money. Funny part is Wendy's double burger had more meat and tasted better and the price was almost a dollar cheaper.",0
"I bought two coffees for my twin and I, planned to buy some food tried to use the bathroom first it wasn't available for 45 minutes so I left without purchasing anything else.
That's a zero rating but I need 1 to post.",0
"Went inside to get service faster, oh was I wrong! Waiting for more than an hour to be served, paid at the touchscreen, got cups to serve drinks and soda was terrible, other people left and requested a refund, people got fired this same night,  Elderly people were still waiting to get some food and told me about their bad experience, they seem to be patient but dang this has to be the worst experience in a McDonald's ever. We are Never coming back.",0
First My Hamburger Was Ugly. It Had The Ketchup All Over The Place!! Next My Fries Were Super Salty And Some Way To Crispy. And Lastly My Shake Tasted Horrible! You Could Taste All The Syrup And There Was No Cherry. The Only Good Thing About My Trip Was Their Playground.,0
"Fast food, fast service. Low quality meals. But, you will probably already know that because it is a McDonald's fast-food, and not a whole foods Cafe organic foods.
The food price is above normal for what you are getting. So, the value is low in the area of food quality for the price. What you are paying for is convenience. They have a very fast drive-thru.",0
"Sat waiting for several minutes before asking for help several times, i said typical bs and backed up to enter other lane when i heard a man laughing from the mic and saying hello.",0
I feel that it is OK to charge to use the restrooms. Yet they are so gross it's not worth it. Employees sneezing on Apple pies whipping hands on seat of pants. The new management is not any better. They where dumb to buy this one. If you have enough room to install two toilets then install two toilets! don't be ghetto and only have only one!,0
"Do not park in their lot even if you are eating there.

The ""parking enforcement"" put a boot on my car after I ate here and refused to take it off unless I paid $75. I told him I just ate here and he told me the ATM was inside, seriously?

Not to mention that the lobby was littered with food waste, staff was rude, they didn't have ice cream or shakes and bathrooms were dirty.

0 stars if I could.",0
"We were waiting in the drive thru on a Sunday morning. We were asked for our order only AFTER WE had said something about asking if our order was going to be taken and after having 5 other cars in the drive thru next to us  had gone. We started ordering and then the employee on the intercom said mid order ""hold on I'm helping a customer"" Um isn't that what you're supposed to be doing with us? I said screw it and drove off. You're in the customer service industry, I suggest learning some.",0
"12:00 am  Wait 10 minutes behind the car in front of me.
12:10 am  Sever: Cash only, our system is down and rebooting.
Me: that's fine.
Sever: ok, what can we get for you.
Me: number one, medium with lemonade please.
Sever: hold on one moment
Me: ok?
Sever:
Me:
12:12. Me: hello?
12:15. Silence
12:20 Silence

That's when I left. One car was at the window, and at least 12 in line to order. It's always something here. No coffee at 6 am. Out of fries. Cash only. 30 minute wait with nothing to show for it. Super frustrating. If you are down to test your patience, give this location a shot.",0
"This particular store you never know when their lobby is open. Quick service, but they never abide by their posted hours",0
I pull up to drive thru and told to wait a moment. I wait 30 minutes to place order still nobody takes my order. I pull up to window thinking maybe I was forgotten. I honking horn employees looks at me and walks away. I stay there for another 15 minutes waiting and still nobody takes my order. And all the while I watch at least 12 other cars pull up to drive thru sit and wait and eventually leave cause nobody is taking orders. If your not going to do your job as an employee of McDonald's let the customers know so they don't have to wait  for nothing. By the way I had to give one star to post this. Other wise they would get -5 stars.,0
Customer service is horrible. Customer isn't right here. There correct and your wrong when they screw up an order,0
It was 3am when I went through the drive threw. I ordered a sausage mcgriddle 4 burritos 5 hash browns. Everything was hot except the mcgriddle. It was completely cold and I had to warm it up in my microwave when I got home. Then called the store and spoke with a manager about the situation.,0
"Just ordered 2 BigMacs, one with no lettuce.
Had NO sauce  the other had  a teaspoon worth on the edge of the burger.
Fries were meh.",0
"This has got to be, hands down, one of the worst McDonald's restaurants around. Their service is downright abysmal. Also they are extremely high-priced. I do have to say that their food does live up to McDonald's standards. But by the time you fight off the homeless people, deal with the bad customer service, and pay exorbitant prices, this location just isn't worth it.  One other thing of note. This location does not honor the surveys for the buy one get one free.",0
"I have never encountered a restaurant so rude before. We arrived there at 10:53 they close at 11, I know it's tabu to show up at a restaurant right before close, but we were 6 hours away from home and hungry. Not only were the doors already locked, but the three employees plus a security guard would not come to the door or even acknowledge we were there. Locking the doors early when your signs state your hours is unexceptable!!!!",0
"Had my car booted by 2 of the dumbest people I have ever met while my girl friend was buying a soda and I was buying wine for a lovely night.  There are 3 total signs displaying this premise, but 2 are on the opposite side of the lot and one is not reflective for their 7-10 night shift of booting/towing.  The signs also say people who aren't patrons will be booted, which I by extension was. My night was spent arguing with the employees and the tow company instead.  I recommend a wholehearted boycott.",0
"This place always has the door lock, so you can not get in to the restaurant",0
"Extremely rude lady in the morning. I spoke to her with a smile and that did not deter her from the destain she showed, from what I assume because she had to serve me. Waaay too many other McDonald's around for me to need to deal with that in the morning.
If you see a short Asian lady with a grey uniform shirt, do not bother, she will just make your morning worse.",0
"Would give zero starts if I would, they all have an ugly attitude as if I was responsible for them working there. I asked for a caramel macchiato and they said the machine wasn working. Then the person behind me or",0
"I would like to preface with the statement that I am a fairly hardcore proponent of the proletariat. With that said, the fact that they force you to utilize the kiosk must me some kind of self sabotage. If people are willing to pay at the counter then it could drive down demand for the kiosk.

Secondly; there is a heavyset woman with glasses that gets mad and angry when customers ask for stuff and has to forward it to the manager every time yelling loud enough for rhe lobby; not to mention she hovers over the lobby while people are eating (i get that you want to catch mess early or clean the tables quick I have worked food service before) but do not hover around people trying to eat like some kind of table patrol.

Fortunately the security guard is calm and collected. I mean generally if youre on the clock where else do you have to be?

Service is inconsistent, per the usual, horrible with Uber eats drivers and seem intent on the self destructive goal of ""sabotage my job"".",0
"Not gonna lie, my nuggets came kinda undercooked.",0
Been waiting in a long line for the past 15 minutes. Pull up to the window to pay and the employee with the long blue fake nails is messing around on their phone watching YouTube. No wonder it was taking forever.,0
"The place is disgusting in terms of cleanliness. Full of homeless people on heroin. We actually threw the food in the garbage after we paid for it.  It looked nasty and dangerously filthy. Parking lot outside is full of shady people checking out what is in your car. When we were leaving we saw about 15 people laying on the sidewalks totally stoned from some drug.
Wouldn't recommend (at all).",0
"Tell me how I end up with a double cheese burger, whose patties, resemble a sloppy joe? My hamburger looked like they cleaned up the grill of all the pieces and threw them on a bun. But I got it quickly and my coke and fries were good so I gave them 2 stars.",0
"Terrible experience with this McDonald's. Employees don't care about nothing, dear manager you are doing great job. ",0
"The area is surrounded by homeless people so there is a strict 30-minute time limit on eating inside the restaurant. The bathrooms are locked and even asking multiple times to use one I was not given access. My fiance found some kind of blueish chunk in his burger and that ended it for us. Nice and clean but unfriendly staff and atmosphere, and frightening food.",0
"Awful place, ordered and ate my chicken tenders, fries and drink. Threw away the waste and sat back down to make a phone call. McDonald's ""security"" kicked me out. Said I couldn't stay more than 30 min. I was there 25 minutes and there was 5 other people in the restaurant. Horrible.",0
This McDonalds forces customers to use the new machines. I couldn't order a large orange juice on my breakfast meal so I asked an employee for help. She didn't know how to order that from the machine either. She told me just order the small and that she would get me a large. While I'm waiting for my order another employee (I think it was the manager) told me I owed 50 cents for the large orange juice. She seemed annoyed with me and maybe the young girl too because we didn't know how to order the large OJ  I paid the 50 cents but was unhappy with how unfriendly and the whole experience was. I won't be back to this particular McDonalds.,0
I'm not sure what anyone who has lived in Utah expects when trying to dine in this area. It's pretty common knowledge that downtown is the heart of the homeless and many drug addicts. Not to mention this location is one block from pioneer park and very close to the road home/gateway area. I'm not excusing any rude or bad experiences but maybe just a bit more patience and compassion? It's fast food. Don't like the area? Dine elsewhere.,0
"We go here after almost every late night event we attend in Salt Lake City. Concerts, Jazz games, Utes games. Will probably find another place. The Fries have been way below the McDonald's standard for the last few times and this last time, they changed their ice cream completely. Now the vanilla cones and the hot fudge sundaes are made with that cheap ""ice cream"" that is a cross between a terrible sorbet and cheap refrozen ice milk. Truly disgusting. At least the Cokes were $1.00...but that won't bring us back.",0
Its an average McDonalds. And i would have rated it 3 stars or higher. But there is always   A rude and sometimes and literate security guard who in morning doesn't speak any English the only English he does know is typed on his cellphone which he charmingly shows you if you don't buy something quick enough he says if you don't buy something get out then at night there's another security guard that isn't that much better he does speak English but again all he ever says is by something or leave,0
No one to take your order just really confusing monitor that took twice as long.  Took forever to get food and c it was still messed up.  Only high point was watching the security guard kicking out a few prior one who dropped drugs on the way out.   Too bad the next closest McDonald's was under repair.  Drive thru only!!!,0
"Like a box of chocolate you may get good service or terrible service. Out of the 5 times I have gone their over a 3 week span, I recieved decent service once. I recomend to avoid  this store",0
"This store's employees purposely turn off and reset their delivery systems payments if they dont ""feel"" like doing their job. Absolutely horrid staff and all should be replaced.",0
This McDonalds has really gone to **** ! The service? Ignored. After finally ordering? They don't take the time to bring you your order or even call out your damn number. Coffee sucks... Oh... And their security ..? Whoever is hiring them should be fired with their security. Total A-holes who treat you like you're loitering after 5 minutes... Total judgmental A-holes. DONT VISIT THIS MCDONALDS,0
"The best thing about this visit was there were napkins and water....so I could wipe down a table before eating. It wasn that busy and the food took a while to get, order was wrong and the staff had an I don",0
Staff are jerks and are inconsiderate don't ever have the lobby open then gets mad when people that don't have a car go up to drive through,0
This place is not 24hrs at all. They need to fix it. Been there a few times late or early and they signs saying use the ap but no one is in building and ap does not place order.,0
Waited in line fire 20 minutes and then they told us it was closed. Terrible customer service with the worst night I퐒,0
"This is the worst McDonald's in the state and the worst one I ever visited in my life, avoid it. I revisit this location occasionally for the past 5 years due to it's convenient location, thinking it had to improve. I am disappointed every time.

The staff here is extremely rude. The food is poor quality. Drive though time is long. Don't know how this store passes McDonald's standards.",0
ice cream machine is always 폹roken? literally always. w,0
"Bad service. No one knows the menu. Says open 24hrs,but drive thru opens at 4am.  Dine in not open either.",0
"I've disliked McDonald's for a long time now, they're always missing something of ours, ice cream machine is always down, their employees seem like they don't even know what to do. I waited for this lady to take my money for 5 minutes and all she did was look at me and took the drive thru orders. So I just pulled up to the other window to pay and it took another 4-5 minutes to friggin pay. Never again going to ANY McDonald's, ever.",0
"This place is a god damn joke.  My girlfriend and I went for egg mcmuffins at 8:00pm on a saturday night, and it took over 20 minutes to get our order.  The food quality was horrendous, and no apology was given for the long wait.  AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS.  Seriously, I don't expect gourmet food from Mcdonalds, but this was truly disgusting.  One english muffin was so hard my girlfriend nearly broke a tooth on it  My egg mcmuffin hadn't even been toasted.  The staff was unfriendly and unapologetic.  What a joke, we are greatly disappointed in this location.",0
"Grossest McDonald's I have ever been to. Dirty floors, like deep dirt gum looking black marks. But the worst part was the fly infestation! Flies all over the food prep area and the tables. Trying not to hurl while flies are landing on my head.",0
They had one lane closed which is fine but the lane they had opened made everyone end up lining up in the street.,0
"Super dirty McDonald's. Stopped to use washroom and the employee in the washroom was getting changed, hands all over stuff in there and just walked out without washing his hands. The same employee then walked out from behind the counter later and kicked some trash on the floor, didn't even react to it or bother to clean it up. Soda/Pop syrup dried all over the drink station with lids and straws in absolute disarray. Management here must be awful to allow this kind of behavior and terrible level of cleanliness.",0
"Most people are very nice, but the guy taking the money...what a grump!",0
"I just watched a vagrant peeing in a cup while eating my breakfast. He then dumped his piss cup out on the sidewalk. For God's sake ppl stop handing out money to hobos it just makes the issue worse. He wasn't even handicapped, yet he sat in a wheelchair. I watched him for an hour. When he didn't get any money from passing customers he stood up and walked away with his ""Help Please"" sign. This McDonalds is filled woth hobos often and I won't be back.",0
"Terrible drive thru. Super long wait, even at an odd time of day. Cold food, less than great service, and they handed me my drink half full, flat, and with the ice already melted.",0
"Honestly have never had a worse experience at a McDonald's. The order confirmation screen is broken, and the person taking orders apparently has not received training on reading back the order for accuracy. Three out of three times I have been to this location they have messed up something major on the order. The most recent time I got some serious attitude from the person taking orders. Spend a few extra minutes to another location or go to Burger King.",0
Customer service is less than impressive. Food quality was average. Longer than normal wait for basic food order.,0
"Too anal about parking. Parked there because had to stops, McDonald's then the liquor store. Went to the liquor store first because didnt want our food to get cold waiting at the liquor store that was packed. Came back to drop off the bottle to go I to McDonald's and they booted my vehicle. Wasn't even parked there 5 minutes. ExplaiNed to the guy that I was going I to McDonald's as well,  he didn't care. He said I should have gone in McDonald's first. Umm then I still would have gotten the boot foe leaving my vehicle there.  No win situation. Well he took my last $25 that was my grandkids dinner money to unboot it. Can't return the liquor and couldn't buy them their dinner either. Thanks McDonald's parking enforcement. Real winners!",0
"I awoke one morning from a dream. Wiping the sweat from my brow, I tried to recall the details. ""Table service at MacDonald's"" I heard my self say aloud. I picked up my phone to find my dream a reality: MacDonald's had implemented technology allowing them to bring my order to me at the table. I could order on the kiosk, take a locator, and lo and behold, my order would appear before my very eyes. It was as if God himself had given me a glimpse of creation.

I sprung from my abode and ran on all fours to MacDonald's as quickly as possible, as if reality itself would evaporate before I got there. I arrived, breath short and mouth whet,   and began the final steps of my journey. My finger met the kiosk screen like lovers separated by the ocean reuniting.

I got my usual, a cheeseburger with no bun or patty, and sat patiently, gripping my locator  like the staff of Moses. The number seven sat abreast my locator -- the day God rested. ""I too would rest,"" I exclaimed aloud, ""when my journey meets it's end, as my food meets my table.""

But in the next instant, I was met with a fate worse than Gob's a thousand fold -- they called out my order from the counter and didn't bring it out to me.

My faith was shattered that day. Never again shall the thought of joy haunt my mind. Never again shall true happiness be known.",0
"This ""cash orders only"" stuff is getting old. get better systems. No other fast food restaurant has to do this so there's no reason you should.",0
I couldn't place an order with a person at this location so we walked out and went somewhere else and ate. The employees here needs to take a customer order instead of tell a person that they need to place an order at their self service machine. We will not be coming back to this location,0
the worst place to go. that when the order was for my children and the answer was for me to leave because they were not going to attend to me,0
"Fries tasted stale, one of the ordered 10 piece nugget only had 9, they forgot Any of the two flavored sauces requested (2 of the 10 piece nuggets were in the order). Just not a great day to go to McD's I guess...",0
"If you want to wait 45 minutes in the drive thru line, this is the place for you. I'd have left but by the time I realized how long it would take I was boxed in by cars",0
Every time I come to the store there is a problem?Drive-through constantly messes up orders the staff are extremely rude and they don't know how to even do their jobs I'm surprised some of them can even get job here...don't go to the store because your order will be messed up and,0
"Pretty awful. No human interaction, kiosks not super intuitive, paying cash... waited 10( a while, maybe not 10)minutes at a register to pay cash. Will go to Wendy's instead. Dirty tables and a homeless looking person helping customers on the self serve kiosks",0
Consistently the worst McDonald's I've ever been too. I quit going here. Even late at night they make you wait forever in the drive thru. You're better off going to the Wendy on the other side of the block,0
"Probably the slowest employees in McDonalds history. This definitely is NOT ""Fast Food"",  the lobby is always dirty and seems to be filled with drug addicts (in part just due to the area). Dont bring your kids here for a Happy Meal.",0
"Had a crispy chicken sandwich and it had been sitting under the lamp so long that it wasn't very crispy!! McDonald's has really changed in the past year, wasn't very happy!!",0
"I usually get the big Mac and or cheese burger for my meal. Instead I was hungry today and got the quarter pounder with cheese and was grossly disappointed. No pickles or onions, just cheese, a hamburger patti, and ozing grease. Worse burger I've ever had and I will never have another",0
Showed up went inside was waiting for friend to get off phone with his father in hospital to see what he wanted to eat. Security decides I'm just a nuisance. Time taken to occur 4 minutes 35 seconds,0
"Is this Mcdonalds or some strange car booting  entity governed by sketchy  people?   Very strange booting  practices.  They film you leaving your car, yet say nothing. The sign is too high and barely visible. They basically  boot your car for not going straight to  McDonald's .

I left to get a wine then grab something from Mcdonalds as well since i was hungry. However, on my way to  liquor store an old man told me to go back grab my car since it will be booted. It already had been booteed ONLY 3-4 mins later when i ran back.

They wouldn't take it off so i kept complaining. Hey said  i should eaither pay $75  now, or $250 after it's towed .

This is a disgusting practice in a first world country.",0
A racist appalling and unacceptable behavior by the security and employees occurred today at this McDonalds. My friend suffered a racist attack by some other white customer who asked the security to have them take my friend who is Hispanic out of the restaurant simply because of the white customers request. This is shocking and disturbing behavior and needs to be remedied and addressed immediately. This restaurant will suffer lawsuits very soon.,0
Loud and crowded.  Table was uneven and whobbley.  Horrible place for a date weekend evening.  Server kept coming and asking if we were ready to order every couple minutes.  Felt rushed.,0
"If you wanna wait 15 minutes in the drive thru line to be told cash only.... literally happens every time. Have never had a quick, positive experience here and I live down the street. Go to another location and don't waste your time. Such. A. Joke.",0
"I went inside bought my food, was harrased to use the bathroom , went outside started eating my breakfast and was told i had to keave because i had been there 30 min. I was in the middle of eating an egg mcmuffin and got kicked off the property. Wont be back! Who does that to their patrons? Naxis?",0
It was terrible first off they overcharged Me by like $12 do not say sorry or apologize One Time and then I get home I don't have my fries and my meal and my burger has onions on it I'm allergic to onions so I can't even eat it I call and complain ask for new burger do you think they can make it right nope I don't recommend it to anybody not even my worst enemy,0
"Hours are wring and they were closed when I went. Usually they're alright, bit not the best McDonald's.",0
The 15 minute wait time in the drive thru is no joke! Management does not care. At least the Homeless dude made some $$ panhandling from all of the waiting cars! Avoid the gridlock!,0
So bad customers service  ...... we were here for a business trip ... we don't want to order on the machine so we ask the guy to help us and he refuse to do so.... So bad that I'll no come back again... I it was kind a cold I hope not cold heart .,0
The security officer made me very uncomfortable. He starred and starred. My mom only got a sweet tea.,0
"This Mcdonalds needs new management. Every time I have been there the manager not the employees screw something up on my order. The managers are very rude and dont have a problem using swear words to try and get their point accross. Just from what I have seen that store would be better off with no managers than the ones they have now, they might even show a profit. I have stopped going to this Mcdondalds and will never go back even though they are only blocks for my work.",0
Bad communication when ordering through the drive-thru. When I recommend this place if customer service is important to you.,0
"Average food, except they don't fill the fry containers all the way. The large is a medium at best. The bathrooms are horrible.  Someone had taken a dump in the corner and there it laid. Yuk.",0
"Stupid slow location, wasting lots of time ever time you go there. Needs a good manager",0
Food was cold and tasteless.  Burger wasn't even warm enough to melt the thin layer of cheese.,0
The cashier doesn't know too much about 'Mobile Order' system causing a lot of time waisted. Everything else is ok. Except that some customers were frustrated about the new self-ordering displays in the store. Apparently not for all.,0
This mcdonalds is a heinous cancer on society. They will boot your car if you are there longer than thirty minutes or they assume that you did not eat there. there was a guy hanging out accros the street filming people parking. He had us on camera going into the mcdonalds we had a receipt and he still put a boot on our car. After arguing with him and going over footage and receipts he finally admitted his mistake. What an atrocious piece of garbage company. This experience is the last straw for a sub par fast food restaurant. I'm done with mcdonalds there's plenty of other sub par restaurant that don't boot paying customers cars.,0
"I would give a zero if I could. I rarely if ever take time to give a bad review, but I ordered 60 pieces of nuggets and then they gave me 20. Then when I tried to call, the phone wouldn't work. Finally when I walked back they acted like it was my fault because I ""forgot"" the other bag that they didn't bring out when the called my order. Terrible place.",0
"Always seems to be a problem when we go at night after hours like between 12a -4a. Be it a system failure,  stock depletion,  etc.  Also the employees are hardly ever happy or cordial in doing their job",0
"Don't seem to know how to read special orders, especially when it comes to food allergies",0
"Manager is rude. Repeats order 3 times, different everytime. Gets it wrong then blames us and tells us to go back in line if we want to order more.  Also, shake machine never works. Likely they don't have one.",0
Horrible service horrible food why is it that no matter where you go these days it gets worse McDonald's is food that's all you have to do and they can't even do that right frappe machine is constantly down they say because of cleaning I doubt they even clean the thing they just don't want to do it. Wake up your fast food you don't want to do the job go somewhere else and be lazy,0
It sad when someone hates their job so bad that they can,0
"Absolutely horrific. For a McDonalds (which I normally don't mind when the craving hits) this location consistently has extremely long waits and bad food. I will always drive to a location farther away, even for a simple double cheeseburger or spicy chicken.",0
Order french fries no salt got the limpest french fries in the world cold and then I got the spicy McChicken the chicken patties had been sitting there for at least an hour to an hour and a half there so dried out and not even hot temperature wise how does McDonald's keep going when they don't care about their food or their customers anymore,0
If any McDonald's could get an order right I would be shocked my blood pressure rises Everytime we get a kids meal for my kids any McDonald's you walk in to is a shot show once I ordered a spicy chicken and I received a bun with lettuce and mayo No chicken the other I got my son a 6 piece nugget kids meal they rang up a 4 piece nugget then charged me $1.50 for two extra nuggets then only put 3 nuggets in the meal i hate everything about McDonald's the service the lack of knowledge or common sense to freaking puti a piece of chicken on a bun or not being able to count it's really sad,0
"It's McDonald's, what do you expect?",0
Call the store for simple questions and management hung up on me,0
I was the last in drive thru and they literally closed the store in my face. This place is a disgrace,0
"Not to sure if my burgers were just removed from the heat chute or what, but my McDouble no pickle tasted like they had pickle and when I took the top off I saw the pickle imprint it makes after you leave it there for a minute and remove them... disappointed ",0
"This place is a hot mess! Very unorganized staff, poor management. multiple orders wrong, wait time is insane for a fast food joint.",0
We came to McDonald's to get 2 mcmuffins and it's been 1 hour and we havent got our order there were only 5 people in the line and we were done with it I don't recomend to go to the drive thru!,0
"Purchased a soda at this McDonalds and walked next door for LITERALLY 5 minutes, came back and had a boot on my car! Apparently, CUSTOMER or NOT if you step off the property the owner of this McDonalds has an agreement with a private company to boot your car! I wont even get started on the ample supply of bums sitting around the property. THIS IS THE WORST SCAM I HAVE EVER HAD DONE ON ME. This McDonalds probably makes a profit off the tickets they spend the day issuing its customers. I will never again visit a downtown McDonalds!!!",0
"Came in and asked for a cup of coffee with milk...a seemingly basic order, that I've had no problem getting at any other Golden Arches in the good 'ol USA. Was told that I could not have milk, only cream. Now isn't this the company that is spending millions to shed its ""supersize me"" obsesity image?  Come now.  Oh, and, for what it's worth, milk is actually cheaper than cream  (well, cow's milk, anyway...not sure about camel milk or elephant milk.)",0
"I've been there 5 times and still have yet to get exactly what I ordered. No one speaks English!

2021 update: it still sucks",0
I had the wosrt experience at his place really bad costumer service I think the employees need more motivation manager so rude I ask   to place my order and she aswer don't you see the order computer there I was I'm sorry I'm visiting for the first time this place !!! Her answer was I'm busy right now!!! Don't recommend this place sorry !!!,0
"Tried to get a Happy Meal, today after the Marvel Show at the arena. The cashier lady was high, as in intoxicated, unbelievable.
Bringing up a report to the City.",0
Horrible service. They got our order wrong and when we went back to rectify it they basically told us that we were wrong and to take a hike. Don't go there.,0
Disappointed again. The gas station across the street will actually give you what you order and charge you only once for it.,0
Very rude pour food quality staff very not concerned with customers management does not have a clue of any policy most of tables were very dirty overall very dingy and not comfortable. Also 30 minutes signs stating you must consume your food and leave within 30 minutes from the lobby very rude very poor reflection of McDonald's!!!!!!!,0
Garbage service wouldn't serve any of there menu cause of short staff on a Friday night horrible,0
They messed up my order and the apple pie was dry and had some plastic stuck to the bottom of it,0
"The service was aweful, the food was bad, the basic hygiene procedures were not being respected (the cashier went from touching money to pick up fries barehanded without washing her hands), and I've been sitting on my toilet for the last 15 minutes slowly dying",0
I sat in the drive thru for 20 minutes just now because the manager on shift at the window was on their phone the whole time while they were severely understaffed.,0
"Short line inside but we all had to wait 20 minutes after ordering for a small order. It seemed like they just kept serving car after car, but made all the people inside wait.",0
The lobby guy is friendly but coughing by people who are eating. Staff were not friendly about no longer being able to take verbal orders and only using the kiosk.,0
Earlier today a lady working there called my sister-in-law a bit**.,0
"Was just trying to place my order in the drive through, couldn't finish ordering due to the lady closing my order prematurely.",0
Worst drive-thru ever I'd give it a half a star if I could. nobody's moving in there with any kind of emergency I don't think the McDonald's corporation intended for this to be a fast food restaurant the moves so slow..,0
We we're waiting for 20 minutes to order and she told us and the person in front to order in the machines they have inside..when she was counting money and her manager told her to stop and she still toke her time,0
Slow. Rude.,0
Went here employee outside say I am the only worker and we don't have much  wouldn't help us,0
"The manager was really rude from the start and we stared arguing with her because the ""ice cream machine wasnt working"" but they were filling it up right in front of our faces and people were walkin out with ice cream overall they were just very rude",0
Worst drive thru experience no exaggerations from the minute we pulled up to when we got out food 20-30min. On a Sunday around 12am.,0
I came at 11:50 in and the drive throw workr was yelling  it was Veronica and Gabe working at the drive throw,0
Very rude staff.  Forgot 5 items of my food. Contact their phone to express my issue.  Never got a response.    Extremely rude drive through person.,0
I was eating here and the parking enforcement booted my car while I was eating. I produced a receipt but the man who booted my car accused me of leaving the premises so eating at this mcdonalds cost 75.00$. Dont ever go here!,0
Very disappointed was in line for twenty minutes. My burger was barely warm the fries were Luke warm and no salt.  I will never be back to this McDonald's,0
I don't hold high expectations McDonalds but this was the worst one I've been to. Wasted over 10 minutes in line receiving no help and left with no food.,0
"This is probably the worst run location I have ever been to. Every time I come in here (which is at least a couple times a month because I work around here) there is a huge line, people begging for money, fighting, employees being rude to each other and their customers. It's not an enjoyable experience.",0
"Forgot half our order, when my husband asked the manager to give us the rest of our food she completely ignored him twice. We're not going back ever obviously.",0
Everyone was rude except for the manager that helped me at the end (I think he was the manager) how hard is it to get a iced coffee and ice cream in a cup ?,0
Took almost an half hour to get a sausage biscuit. I haven't been to Mc Donald's in years and now I remember why. Thanks for serving a billion crappy meals.,0
"the boy who takes the orders does not know what he is doing I was missing things in my order, but they charged me.l'll never go there again.",0
Argue with the manager about how their ice cream machine wasn working as I watch them serve someone else ice cream. The MANAGER gav,0
Food was gross and everything was cold. People at drive through were rude. I suggest to go to Crown Burger on N 300W. Food is great and service is friendly.,0
I ordered some food and stuff and I asked for water and they still try to charge me a dollar for the water unacceptable I have gotten free water from other McDonald's before I'm purchasing food unacceptable,0
"Iced coffee was watered down, & the idiots did not include syrup with my hotcakes!!!?? Not to mention food was cold and rubbery. $15 breakfast from hell",0
"Very poor service...sometimes they don't have things, they can't get special orders right, staff is rude...all-around bad experience",0
Very slow service usually not worth my time trying to stand in line with what I have seen,0
They missed half my order and I tried giving them a call but they sent me straight to voicemail or would answer and just leave the phone there this is by far the worst food chain I have ever been to and pretty much just stole my Money,0
"Not a 24-hour location. If you're not running a 24-hour business, then make you advertise your open and close times accurately.",0
Stay away from this place!!,0
The employees were very rude and very unpleasant. Need better people skills. And better staff,0
No customer service skills. Every time ive been there they have been rude for no good reason.,0
"They always overcook the nuggets and now the tenders, horrible!!!",0
"The only Mc that close s at 6pm and go,s to driveway only!",0
Their free WiFi unfortunately does not work properly at this location at this time. That should probably be maintained pretty soon.,0
They should probably update their signs so that we know the times they're actually open.,0
Homeless people will ask for money in the parking lot. The restroom has always had a dirty homeless guy washing himself or in the toilet stall  EVERYTIME that I have used it.,0
They charge me for umsweet  ice coffee even I never have coffee in whole life also they charge me twice from my card because I handover my card to cashier,0
Why did you give me all the wrong orders?,0
They should probably prepare for the midnight and after rush that they seem to get EVERY night.  It can't be a surprise.  5 minutes waiting just to order!,0
"Ghetto, dirty, one employee in particular was extremely rude and clearly didn't want to be there.
The food came out quickly so there's that.",0
The Security gaurd was rude and dismissive and for the second time now the man at the pick up window completley ignored us even though OUR food was ready and gave ( tried to give us the wrong order.),0
"The people was nice, but they charged me $ 1.09 for a cup of ice on a 100 degree day",0
The McDonald's employee straight up lied toy face when I ordered something and asked them to make an order special to accommodate my needs.  McDonald's needs to reevaluate customer service.,0
Worst experience at a McDonald's restaurant. Dont waist your money at this location.  Recommend going somewhere else.,0
they skip me 2 times and they took for ever  to give me my food to the point they forgot what i order well not be going to that one ever again,0
Long wait and often they are only doing cash have waited in line for ten minutes to find out they are only doing cash a few times. Last few times I stopped it was better.,0
"I was about to walk in but every door was locked, I called and they hung up on me",0
Bad customer service. Manager flipped me off because i didn't know the menu,0
It's still just McDonald's.,0
Always mess up the orders inside and drive up. You always have to repeat your order 2-3 times. Awful!!!,0
Lobby closed on Sunday.  Only open Mon-Sat 9-2.,0
Food always tastes like it's sat under a warmer for 3hrs,0
Terrible service and the person working the drive through had issues understanding my order due to a language barrier.,0
My last visit there was disdisgusting I went to the bathroom one of the stalls there was crap everywhere in it on the toilet seat and then I went to the other one and there was blood on the walls I'm never gonna to back and the customer service was not that great,0
Typical of corporate America to say give us money in return will give you processed food and a clown to help you wash it down.,0
"Generally pretty fast, but panhandlers will often try to approach you while you are in or near the drive-thru, which is extremely unsafe.",0
It was so messy it made  my mom stressed,0
"While the food was fine and fast, the place was a mess. Not like normal fast food, which is usually a little dirty. It was incredibly dirty.",0
Went to drive thru and they were closed.,0
Thee absolute worst service. If you feel like waiting an hour for anything I suggest going elsewhere. Place sucks.,0
"Burgers were cold, fries were cold and limp and shakes were like water. TERRIBLE!",0
The crew here is very rude and disrespectful.  Every table  was dirty and after asking to get a rag I waited another 10 min ...,0
The can be long lines in the drive thru. I've been approached by panhandlers here despite the presence of security officers.,0
App wouldn't work...dinning room supposed to be open til 2 pm was closed before 130 pm,0
"When the sign says 24 hours, it's not okay for the cashier to refuse to serve a customer. Will be talking to their general manager about this.",0
Sucks. Consistently makes hard/overcooked/dry food. Fries are never salted. Tea is whack asf,0
Picture very dissatisfied with this location they do not value customer service I do not appreciate being forced to use a mechanical device to order my food I want to talk to human being when I order,0
People here are hostile and not safe... choose a different location please.,0
"Made me pay $1.29 to use the restroom, won",0
Warning!! Use drive-thru ONLY! There is a Predatory Towing Company (ABC Towing)  that WILL boot your car! And force you to pay CASH ONLY to have the boot removed.,0
Was treated like a number only. Food was ok but not the best hard around the edges my food was kind of thrown at me not a good experience,0
"The so called manager was mean as hell they told us that the ice cream machine was broken but we literally watch them make the ice cream and we saw a guy walk away with four McFlurrys, and told us shes gonna call dispatch",0
add a maintenance person was very rude to me told me I was in his way and I Curtis Lee moved out of his way on purpose then you got a big guy coming up with no uniform or anything asking me if I got a problem it's not a good place,0
because the sausage mcmuffin is reasonably priced and it confuses me when ask for one I always get the overpriced awful one,0
Worst McDonald's I have ever been to.,0
Terrible location to go to I waited for  25 minutes in the drive-through I told three different people what my order was and I still managed to get the wrong drink and a hair in my burger do not go here !!!,0
they wouldn't let me order an ice cream cone and they were super rude about it!,0
It took forever and not fresh. Woman very mean to me,0
Very slow drive thru. People are lazy on preparing orders and take forever.,0
Got to the window to pay and the employee was just sitting on her phone. Honk 3 times nothing. So I yelled at the window and she finally looked at me,0
"Was not open very rude, couldnt even ask a question people just walked away",0
Worst experience I have ever had I waited over 45 minutes for a kid's meal and a sandwich that kitchen didn't know how to run the kitchen or how to place orders my order was wrong we had to keep correcting everyone was rude and ignored us all it was the worst experience I have ever had with McDonald's I would not suggest ever going to that McDonald's,0
Worst service I've ever received. Didn't understand the difference between a regular burger and a a grill burger. Meal was completely wrong.,0
Nothing. Always slow order is wrong and fries are cold. I've lived in this area for 12 years and the last year has been the worst ever!,0
Very unprofessional staff. Complained about receiving the wrong order they charge me extra to change it!,0
"Worst experience EVER!!!!!!!!! employees fighting in front of customers, waited with my family (hungry kids) for more than 25 minutes to get our food..please don't come to this place!!!!!!....",0
Slowest drive through I've ever been to. Waited for 30 minutes. SMH. Why did I waste my time?,0
Never gets the order right!! Manager Olga dont know how to be a manager.,0
"This worker kept watching this family and harassing them, you could see the visual discomfort as they tried to enjoy there food with there family.",0
The brief interaction with the cashier was almost non existent. The large order of fries was more of a small order of fries.,0
"I've been waiting in line for 32mins, still no help and I have about 100% chance of them not getting my order right. I hate them!",0
"Terrible customer service. Don't plan on a friendly greeting and don't pay with cash, it will take forever to get help at the register.",0
rolled up to the window and someone told me the power was out. 10 minutes of my life i'll never get back.,0
How do you mess up an egg mcmuffin? Extremely dry buns! I was checking for mold they were so dry.,0
Mc Chicken Was Very Old Taste Like Cardboard. Not Very Happy...,0
"Very poor service, cashier was treating customers very poorly, was very forgetful and when reminding her she gave attitude, never coming here again",0
"I walked from the trax station. The employees thought, I am hobo. I am not hobo. I live in salt lake city.",0
They're the most horrible wait time and the treat you like you are trash regardless,0
"The staff was so rude, I asked to use the restroom and the lady working there was so awful about everything I was almost afraid to eat there let alone use the restroom...SYAY AWAY!!",0
Extremely slow service (usually 20+ minute wait for the drive through) and most of the time they get the order wrong.,0
They always get my order wrong and make me pull around the front to wait for my food,0
Rude. Workers barely speak english. Went to manager about rudeness and she didn't care.  Won't eat there any more.,0
This is just the worst possible food u can it. Service is ok tho.,0
They booted my car.  Wouldn't takenit off without paying $80 cash only.  Shady place.  Beware - don't park or eat here.,0
New hires taking order the night shifts are so sweet and well behaved. But McDonalds itself is NOT,0
Does anyone work here??? We have to order ourselves I don,0
They make you purchase something before they unlock the restroom door remotely. The cashiers are rude as well.,0
Took like forever to get just a large sweet tea. Must have been a slow night.,0
When I told the cashier my drink wasnt right he argued with me that that's how they make them there.  No way!,0
All the Macdonald  r having  problems  with getting  people's on line orders ready,0
"Long wait, employee didn't know what he was doing. Manager seemed associated with employees and with customers.",0
Very lazy and not willing to help with any questions ans the manager doesn't have time to talk about an issue I was wanting to talk about.,0
Had to say hello at the drive thru over and over to get anyone to take an order .   And of course they had no ice cream,0
Worst service in the history of human time. Waited 30 minutes for a cheeseburger. And the store was dirty!,0
It was not a clean restraunt at all to many homeless people in there watching you eat and asking for food,0
Service food served at McDonald's Jesse really stood out but I do give this place into CA re Dee,0
"How the hell do you rate a Mickey Dee's. Food the same in all of them, some have decent or even great help, so many have truly worthless turds..........all a management issue.",0
Never come back to this place again the french fries were hard and cold and so is a chicken nuggets,0
Bathrooms are dirty and messy front lobby look good tables were wiped down and cleaned good hot piping food,0
Drive thru is horrible. Mess up my order EVERY time.,0
"The food was dry, the fries were stale.  I had better at other McDonalds.",0
"Slooooooooow. After confirming the order three times they still got it wrong. Also, it's so freaking slow.",0
Buttermilk chicken was dry. Horrible meal. And cashier was really rude.,0
Sevice was very bad and employees were not in uniforms  no napkins and letting a person dig through the trash  and employees waiting on other employees before customers.,0
They never get my order right wait is forever and no to people friendly,0
Prefer other locations. Always security inside here and constant shady business going down outside.,0
some homeless was there semi clean although great customer service,0
I cant find a mcdonalds downtown anywhere that can get it right. Terrible food. Bad service.,0
Worst customer service I've had at a fast food restaurant.,0
Terrible employees and shady as hell location. Its like that's homeless deadbeat central over there,0
"good food, but very shady location and people in the area
feel unsafe here",0
I waited over a half an hour just to get to the order window for the drive thru at 12:30 in the morning,0
You have a 75% chance of getting a wrong order if you go through the drive thru,0
Terrible just terrible. Will not be returning cause of the long time to even order my food.,0
"The worst place ever!
They made us to pay 80 dollars just because we didn't walk in McDonald's first. How horrible is that?!",0
"Can't get orders right. Slow service, but usually friendly staff.",0
"Bread used for burger was very bad, it was completely different than what we usually get in other McDonald",0
Late night service is horrible. 40 minute wait in line. They don't do curbside.,0
Beggers knocking on car windows..swarming all over the parking lot,0
"Slow service, full of dirty, vulgar customers. Wouldn't take my kids into this slum.",0
I don't want to order using the computer. It's confusing and slow don't force it. Let me order with an actual human.,0
Claim to be open 24/7 apparently not on Wednesday,0
"Had to use the computerized ordering system in the store self serve, the employees didn't even know how to use it go figure",0
Went twice to men restroom and 0 paper towel. Told the front desk lady yet no action :(,0
This location is only open until midnight now. No longer 24/7.,0
No longer open 24 hours. Closes at 11 pm nightly.,0
The McDonald's app keeps malfunctioning. It says you've used the deal when you haven't.,0
"No shakes, wrong order, long wait, bathroom locked, sloppy coffee, wrong coffee, just not great at all.",0
The food was cold and not what I ordered I did drive thru.,0
Woman at cash register refused to take my order....want me to learn a kiosk.no way.,0
"They were fast, but my fries and sandwich were cold.",0
Way under staffed.   20 minutes in the drive up window and terrible service.,0
F***ers put a boot on my car even though I bought some food bring someone with you and have them wait with car and keys,0
The manager was disrespectful and Rude. All the staff was very unprofessional. Will not be returning.,0
"Says open 24 hours, false! Not open 24 hours.",0
Terrible. Restroom is locked. Has no electrical outlets. Employees are rude. Doesn't deserve my business.,0
Literally worst McDonalds ever service ever. Never sat in a line so long....,0
One snotty cashier..to the next .. they need to teach friendly customer service,0
"As usual,  they messed up my order",0
Customer service was horrible and the security guy was mean and horrible.  Will not be going back!!!,0
"About what you'd expect from McDonald's, but it seems the franchisee forgot to pay the heating bill. Unprofessional (and cold)!",0
It's almost 3 am and it took 40 min for me to get to the pay window,0
My food was old and stale. Barely ate my egg and cheese biscuit same with my hash-brown.,0
Can,0
Their sprit soda tastes just as faucet water.,0
They decide to take their time; even when its a fast food and get timed,0
Twice I've tried to get ice cream or Mcflurry & never have it,0
The place is disgusting. Service was slow and the got my order wrong.,0
"Employees there very rude, well be a very cold day in h*ll before I make that mistake...",0
"I only go here for breakfast, I don't like there regular menu items.",0
To much begging for money from homeless people come right up to the car,0
"Bad service, cold food. Never go there",0
Closes during business hours for the lobby.,0
I walked in to meet a friend that was eating and ended up with a boot on my car. Don't go here,0
I had chicken mc nuggets. They tasted y they had been sitting for awhile.,0
Never gets order right takes along time to get your food,0
Got harassed by a security guard minute I pulled made for an uncomfortable experience to many homeless people around,0
After many years not eating junk food this time I found the big Mac was worse than long time ago. I guess downsizing pickles and tomatoes is their answer to healthy foods and cutting costs. But of course it filled me up.,0
"Ordered a buy one, get one sausage egg and cheese biscuit , went home, rook an hour or longer ONLY to discover there was NO cheese on either biscuit!!!!! I'm  a cheese lover, so this really furiated me! PLEASE DO BETTER!!!!!",0
"I'm not usually one to post 1 stars, but their service here is awful, the drive through is so slow, and we went to a mobile order and there's no reason why at a fast food place I am waiting for over 30 minutes. AND their phones not on, you can't even call them. I'm late to work once again because of them. This isn't a one time thing, its always like this every time I come here. They have lost a customer.",0
They stop serving breakfast at 10:30am.  As if people are lining up to get cheeseburgers at 10:31am...,0
Gave me fries that have been sitting and it hard and  wasn't fresh. The sandwich was sloppy,0
I am so mad just imagine eating your breakfast sandwich while chewing you pull a piece of her out your mouth. That is what just happened to me.  I tried to call the store but no one is answering the phone.  McDonald's 1900 block of M Street NW Washington DC,0
"This place is dirty.  The service is so slow.  So many homeless loiter here and often beg for money at the entrance.  Management and staff are indifferent to the conditions.

Steve and Piero are delusional.  The one bathroom is unisex, and you need a coin for that.  Play area?!?!?  Where?",0
"The employees are friendly. Food comes out slow. Too many homeless people inside beggin for money or food even though there are signs posted for 20 minute limit stays. I퐉 not unsympathetic to the homeless, however the staff at this location permit them to hang out (",0
Every two seconds the door flings open with another customer and you freeze to this cold weather. On top of that the bathrooms require a token to be inserted and can  be obtained by anyone at the registers free of charge. Meanwhile there are fully unlocked and working bathrooms on the second floor that everyone can use. The worse part was that the entire staff was Mexican and did not speak one word of English to each other. As a matter of fact they were laughing and having a great time in their own language while taking my order which is extremely rude to me and to other customers.,0
"This place is newly renovated, but it is not spacious. The new touch screens for placing orders are the reason for this. The new seating is cramped as well. I placed my order with the cashier and she could barely understand plain English...probably why the touch screens are there. I'm not coming back to this McDonald's.",0
Punks don't know respect,0
NOT OPEN 24/7.  Beware criminal activity around this location.  Was almost mugged when I showed up to a CLOSED restaurant at 12AM.,0
"A little run down, and doesn't have a full menu. Really wanted some breakfast burritos, but couldn't get any. Food tasted fine, but the employees were rude. I think they assumed no one spoke Spanish, but I do, and I heard them making fun of customers and their accents and how they talk and what they were ordering.",0
Drive thru service took 25 mins,0
Staff behind the counter watched a homeless drug addict get right in my face and demand money...and they did absolutely nothing.  The guy even followed me from the waiting line to the condiment area and just kept staring.  9 in the morning during the work week.,0
"This is the nearest McDonald closest to me, so I order with Ubereats, the delivery is so fast you would think it a good thing, but no, it not, it only means that orders are prepared prior to your order so even though the delivery is fast, your enti",0
"Based on experience with mc donalds in europe, this is rather sub-par. But it is ok, gets the job done in feeding you.",0
"Filthy environment,  broken booths, and bathroom required a token .  Staff was unable to correctly fill my order for three beverages.  I ordered a coke, a diet coke and an unsweetened ice tea.  It required 2 tries to get the drinks to me.  This experience took at least 15 minutes.",0
It opens 24 hours but the staffs don't let people go to the bathroom for no reason. We got there at like 8.40 pm. They are all very rude to the customers. NEVER COME HERE AGAIN!!!!!!,0
"CLOSED. UPDATE YOUR HOURS. GAS PRICES ARE WAY TOO HIGH FOR CUSTOMERS TO UBER TO YOU, THINKING ITS OPEN. RIDICULOUS.",0
"I used the McD's mobile app for the first time. There was a ""deal"" available through the McD's app that was a great value & fit what I enjoy at McD's (occaisionally). Everything processed for the order... once I succeeded in completing the order with small amount of difficulty. Checked my account two days later as part of semi-weekly review. The McD's mobile ordering double charged me for the order. They processed two charges for the one order. When rhe corporate McD's was contacted they apologized, stated the program has occasional quirks (being worked out), and told me I needed to drive out of my way to go back to the store to get my money back. After explaining that they would have to reimburse my time and expenses to do their legwork in correcting their error of stealing my money AND explaining that they simply review their detail processing report of electronic charges for the two transactions (I provided the actual transaction info for date, time, #'s etc) they agreed to process the charge reversal.... because they WOULD NOT reimburse my time/expenses to return to get my refund of money they stole out of my account. After considerable time and insistence on my part, the manager agreed and reviewed the transactions report, verified the double billing, and assured the charge will be reversed. I got a follow up call from the area manager for McD's who turned out to be VERY unprofessional and rude in her attitude and handling if the matter. She actually admitted she hung up on me when I was reprimanding her on her shortcomings for not listening to what I was saying and continually speaking loudly over me, while I was speaking. Interesting..... is this how McD's is improving the bottom line, by stealing? NO ONE at McD's, even after explaining the process to correct an improper charge, had a clue how to address or willingness to pursue. They directly stated it was on me. I had to come back to a store, out of my way, to get a refund of my money, that they improperly seized from my account. Unbelievable as that is for my 1st mobile order/purchase experience w/McD's they were excited I used it and recommended I try the mobile order system again soon. Yeah right..... I'm gonna use a system with a 100% failure rate (my experience) and that they have no knowledge of how to process system failures, that do occur to their admission & knowledge. Horrible experience in all regards. Clearly rolled out the program with known links and poor or no training in corrective measures when incurred.",0
Worst McDonalds I have ever been too. The water they provided was pink and when I asked if we could get new waters the lady told me all of the water comes out that way and there is nothing she could do about it. In other words she was too lazy to get me new waters. Can figure out why McDon,0
"For one usually it's only for coffee and to get away from the office as I stopped eating McDonald's food. The problem I faced recently was a homeless person who walked up to me and asked for 2 dollars for bus fare. When the bus stop is like 2 to three blocks down the road. I said I will buy you something to eat or drink but not give money. So,  for folks or tourists who get folks coming to them asking for money I suggest trying to offer food to them is more important then money. One thing about DC is there is alot of resources for folks who need money for bus fare or anything can find. Food too they know where to go. It's up to them to make that move. Another major situation I noticed is the McDonald's need some updating. I might know why they keep it so dull looking because McDonald's operates with the homeless so I guess they don't want to make it too comfortable. I been to much better ones who got nice and cool lounge chairs couches and OMG this one just looks ragged.",0
There's no need to order from the drive thru because you'll receive whatever they put in your order,0
"Sorry. Old fry-oil gave the nuggets a bad taste. The level of  chlorine in the water made the Coke taste bad (tasted chlorine ) and the cheeseburger were cold a soft.
The only good was the french fries.",0
Not good all the Hispanic cater to Hispanic Americans stand in the store for 20 minutes while they socializing with the Hispanics,0

"It's a nice place with good taste of Burger, but the associate's attitude is just so rude. Poor customers service.",0
I'd say a below average McDonald's. Very dirty and lots of homeless on weekends I've been here. No friendly workers here which is a McDonald's usual but you do generally get what you order somewhat quickly. It is probably as cheap as you'll get in the area.,0

"The environment wad ""tired"", I mean you feel tried  when you enter there. I won't come back here again.",0
By far the worst McDonalds experience I've ever had. They locked their doors when their sign clearly said they were to be open; then the staff was incredibly rude.,0
Took 22 minutes to get a cup of tea,0

"McDonald's has become the worst fast food option. Bad food, poor service at almost all of there restaurants.",0
This is not a McDonald's that I would recommend. They have huge roaches and are not the friendliest....staff can be extremely rude. There's always some type of odor!!,0

"I will be brief: I have never seen such a McDonald's!! The furniture probably has not changed since the opening of the first institution (1948), apparently the dress code does not apply here. The counters are served by people in civilian clothes, it is not clear who they are. Okay, I ordered food on the spot to eat, he hands me a bag of food...",0
A misery no hot coffee no fruit juice and almost nothing in breakfast. Terrible when you come for lunch. And the sanitary facilities open with a room. The greatest anything from Mac Do. Never seen,0
Very badly there are many homeless people inside you cannot eat in peace because of the bad smell and there are even some asking for money to buy the truth it scared me while I was inside buying because they saw that I took a 20 dollar bill and by force wanted me to give it money to buy and those who ask are not destitute,0

I stopped in for a quick bit, or so I thought. I had no issue with the food or the face that there was a wait. What I had an issue with was the one male working the counter was more interested in flirting with the girl with pink hair working the fry machine that he had customers waiting for him to stop talking to her just to get them items he left off their order. At one time I was able to finally get the pink haired girls attention and I told her I was missing a coke. She told him and he went on flirting. I finally got his attention and told him I still needed my coke and he turned around and asked someone else to get it and went right back to his flirting. I do not think that his actions or lack there of reflects the overall workers at this location, but at the end of the day his actions are reflected in the review ratings that myself and others have given. The food is great, certain staff at this location not so much.",0
Busy loud dirty disgusting. The food was mediocre at best the restaurant was filthy employees were over stressed and understaffed so I really couldn't communicate with them. I had an issue with a deal on the app and was not being allowed to use it appropriately but ended up having to pay a higher price anyway because I couldn't relate my issue to the manager without stalling line and making people wait longer.,0
"The worst McDonald's I've ever seen. The service is incredibly unpleasant and unwilling. You enter a locator at the kiosk, but you still have to go to the counter for your order. Find out they haven't a cappuccino. You ask what others can they offer you - without an answer. You talk about coffee with milk and you get something disgusting that doesn't even remotely resemble coffee. Without apology, with unpleasant looks and even with a rude comment among the employees. Terrible customer service.",0
"You have never experienced a food establishment like this one before. Probably because they've all been shut down. I've been reluctantly stopping in this place while shopping in Macy's for many many years and it's the same experience everytime. At this point, I do it for the entertainment. The kiosk and ordering setup is a recipe for disaster, just for starters. But you will usually wait 30-45 minutes just to be told that all the food and everything you ordered is sold out. If you're lucky enough to get your food, and it seems edible, there's 0% chance the dining room will be open. With all that said, it's not even the worst part. The staff are the craziest, rudest, nastiest human beings you will ever experience. They have zero filter. They scream and curse at eachother and the customers. One time I got yelled at for asking for sweet and sour sauce and they then proceeded to gather and talk about me asking for sweet and sour sauce, as if there's something wrong with that. After ignoring the request I asked again and she made an over exaggerated movement while rolling her eyes and putting her hand out, telling me it was $1. For 1 sauce. It was the best entertainment I've ever received for the money.",0
"Beware this location.
I am a huge user of Mcdonald Happy Meal for my child so I know how to use a Mcdonald app order but this location is not working at all. Furthermore, the kiosk order system just takes the money from the credit card.(receipt paper was run out) even the person register took my order twice for one happy meal.
I paid 4 times for one happy meal. I understand this place is overcrowded in the Macy's department but they can work better. I won't go back to this location ever. Worst place ever.",0
"Terrible place, computers failing massive line at front to order food, 1 till open, asked management for assistance as I am a diabetic

None offered nothing we can do for you managed to get food after 45 minutes!! I was lucky my wife got the food and took over the wait

Don",0
"I waited more than 20 for a  mcchicken smh , I asked the worker if they called 115 yet 16 min in and she just looked at the screen and said nothing to me , I waited 22 minutes in finally the manager looked at me and I gave her my receipt and she gave me the mcchicken that the girl had there waiting ! I normally will not complain however this is more than traumatizing because of where it in ,",0
This McDonald needs to hire staff! From breakfast to lunch this place is always backed up with orders. I order my food on the McDonald app and give them 30 min,0
"I don understand how the workers got hired, they were slow and made me wait 20 minutes for an order I had placed before I went on lunch break meaning almost 30 minutes ago. The worker didn even bother t",0

"rude and very slow staff, half an hour before the closing of the store they closed the area with tables, I had to eat near the cash register",0
At 151 W34th in Manhattan NY (inside Macys) :. Twice in the last 5 weeks I've waited 30-40 minutes on an order. This location is understaffed by 3 employees. Customers were returning COLD food.,0
We went there today ordered just 2 drinks waited 35 minutes for them manager told us to 퐌iss off?when we politely asked if we could get our drinks,0
"I had recently ordered a chicken sandwich combo  3 weeks back, mind you I haven had it in 7 years because I knew any and All fast food is bad for the body. But baybeeee the day I opened my meal the chicken looked like a soggy wet pad with extra mayo & some green grass that looked like lettuce  but was soggy as well. The only thing I got to enjoy were my fries. I should have told them to run me my money back with a free ice cream but we all know they machines stay broke d",0
"Didn't give my McFlurry and when I went up and ask for it they gave it to me all melted up, save yourself the trouble and go to some other McDonalds, workers has attitude.",0
"Worst McDonald ever  half the time staffs on the phone or having conversations with each other while orders get backed up  than when you say something they have the nerve to get angry,  also the morning manager locks the doors and doesn",0
"I only gave a 1 because I have to. By far the worst serviced, dirtiest, and had the most amount of rude, ignorant employees including the manager. Have been to McDonald's all over the US and several other countries and this by far the worst I ever seen or been in.
Food- 0 of 10 (cold, didn't give whole order, gave drinks that were sitting there with ice melting on a counter)
Service-0 of 10 (did kiosk order, and waited 29 minutes for my order after being told by 1 employee my number wasn't ready as it sat there and I saw it. Manager looked at me/over me 3x before asking me what number I was. Then a lady came from the back of the kitchen and helped me as best she could.
Will specifically tell people not to go here when they travel during the holidays. Its a shame this place isn't kept up with like the rest of the macys store and stores around it.",0
"quarter pound deluxe no cheese???? why? cant do job right? salt even have no fry. still ate. unpleased, i hate burger kung",0
"This staff does not regard the publicly posted hours, or the manager does not pay them to clean up after hours. I showed up at least 2 hours before the publicly posted closing time, and 30 minutes before the closing time verbally expressed by the cashier. Still, they only had fountain drinks, old coffee, stale mcnuggets, and ONE stale fish filet available. They had decided to clean all equipment and stop making food well before closing. Macy's is a long-respected New York institution. This lackluster and poorly run franchise is a detriment to a great store.",0
"The only reason I give this place a one is because there isn't a 0 option this is the WORST McDonald's I've ever been to.  The staff is RUDE.  We had to wait 20 minutes to order when there wasn't anyone else in line.  Couldn't use the bathroom until we showed a receipt and then there was no toilet paper.  A worker brought paper towels up,  said there was no toilet paper and let his girlfriend jump in line in front of me to use the bathroom. Couldn't even get in the men's bathroom the door was locked and you couldn't get in there.  Told the staff about it and they could care less I've never been treated so poorly.  The guy that was guarding the stairs to the bathroom was a poor excuse for an employee and McDonald's is wasting their money on paying someone to treat customers poorly.",0
"Trash restaurant.  So rude and gave me what I  didn't order. I order large sweet tea with no ice. First gave me large one with ice. I said no ice. Then waiting for long time, gave me a small one with no ice. So ridiculous.  Rude all the time.  Without any sorry and shame.
So never come back!",0
"Terrible service. We bought a whole bunch of items and asked for an ice water.

They refused to SELL ice water to us.

I have never been to a McDonalds that REFUSES to SELL ice water. (It's usually free)

Also, the lady who took our order could barely understand English and had to ask another employee to translate for her. We ended up repeating our order three times.

This is probably the worst service I have ever had at McDonalds.",0
"Bad experience..they even charged me 1.29 for hot water..but on the recipe was hot tea.so i go back to tell the lady i want hot water not hot tea,the lady she took back the tea bag and tell me oh we even charged for hot water too.I'm like then why on the recipe you put hot tea? She's like ok you can talk to my manager.so i go there talk to the manager and tell her what happens he manager said yes we charged for hot water. I  left wi",0
"The most disgusting McDs ever. Staff is ridiculously obnoxious, offensive, incompetent in every way imaginable. They treat every one that comes in as an addict or criminal. All the tables are filthy. Hispanic security guard on Wednesday night at end of shift, addressed me as mammy, when I told him that comment was inappropriate, he cursed me out, and commented that I was old enough to be his mother .... not sure how this may have made it appropriate in his head. In addition I doubt very much that statement was true... while he was talking thus... he was also changing his sneakers in the disgustingly dirty dining area. The security guard replacing him, was changing his clothes in plain sight as well... The bathrooms have broken doors, stalls are anything but private. I feel safer with the riff raff than the overpaid security guards.... Been here twice, and just when I thought it could not get any worse... Cashiers can do",0
"This has to be the worst place on earth. I work here at Macy's. My order number is 282 and the food was terrible. I picked up the scrabler eggs and litterly could not shake them apart. The biscuit was colder than the weather outside. When I asked for fresh food then the managers get mad at me. This place sucks. Macy employees should boycott this place. The only reason I gave 1 star, there's not anything lower.",0
"What happened McD? Open up!!! June 19, 2021.",0
"Terrible experience at McDonald's in Macy's. They forgot to do simle order, while told them they forgot again. As a best customet experience they are screaming number while looking on display visible to them only instead of showing on display also to customers like in other restaurants. I haven't seen such uncoordinated McDonald's restaurant. Shame shame shame",0
Extremely slow and impolite staff.,0
Ordered via display and wait 15 minutes for a sundae ice cream and then they tell you that there is no ice. No service and unmotivated staff. Unfortunately!,0
The workers do not wear gloves nor hair nets. The setting is very unprofessional. Workers were texting and having inappropriate conversations. Poor customer service and long wait time for food.,0
This Macdonald's is a joke. Late again . I'm an employee of Macy's and 4 out of 5 times a week they open late. And the food is not worth it. 1 st class JOKE . Would give 0 stars.,0
Waited 15 mins for my sundae until I asked to get it. They didn give me a spoon and I asked for nuts from two workers and,0
Got a eye roll and attitude from one of the employees just for asking for the sauce I wanted for my 10-piece because she was already putting in a sauce that I had never asked for.,0
I liked the chicken strips.they were a little doughty though. Don't like their artery clogging burgers and fries.the coffee is better than over hyped up Starbucks.,0
"Horrible service. Rude staff named Marian. Went to several fast food joints s in new york, dc or LA and their service was nowhere as low as this one.",0
25 mins for a drink very nice,0
The security will kick you out if you don't finish your food in 15 mins. I was sooo shocked today when he came on me,0
"To avoid ! Restaurant room very small. Sad for a store with 8 floors. We had to eat outside after ordering ""on the spot"" No place to eat! And the staff not friendly at all.",0
"Early morning shift had horrible service. Didn't provide a fork yet I had pancakes. Knife only.
I asked for a hot black coffee I get a foamy coffee.
I really don't believe it that's hard to take an order then have it repeated back to me at the window yet still mess up the order.
They need competent people who aren't just gossiping early morning.",0
"This location consistently neglects basics like including sauce, utensils and will substitute your desert side for whatever else they feel like.  If you order a coffee with extras, 4/5 times they won put them in. I, like any normal person, loathe paying for things I don get! This happens often but today something egregious happened: I ordered a 3 pack of cookies. Checked the bag, there were only 2 inside. So I asked for the 3rd, a woman working there snatched the cookies from me and darted back (i assumed to grab the missing item) she returned empty handed and said more cookies are coming.

"Horrible place for service.  I paid for my food a deluxe breakfast at 1115 AM, I was then told to park in Reserved space 1.
After 20 mins waiting I walked up tot the window and the female cashier said they forgot my order. I got my order after and my deluxe breakfast was cold! What a waste of money!",0
Food was cold at the drive-thru and in the store closed lobby early it was still daylight  a very bad experience never going there again. 占쏙,0
I had messed up a order and I called them to tell him that I want to cancel the order and get a refund but the first time I called no one answer the phone the second time I called it answer with a ring but no one talked and that  happened to third time too I don't know what's going on. The phone is probably broken but I still want my refund,0

Service usually isn't too good here. I come here for Uber Eats a lot. One night, three times this same location. Service was slow all three times!",0

"I said it was an order, went to the window to pick up the food, and asked me to drive again and queue up.
never come here again",0
This McDonald is a mess. They ran,0
Food is fine just dont walk outside as the area is filled with odd characters and not safe. Inside are people sleeping in the restaraunt and staff doesnt care so drive thru is recommended!,0
Don't eat here it's bad for you.,0
"The food was ok. It's McDonald's. Though I really am surprised on how the place looked. They may be remodeling the place. It's just not how I'm use to seeing McDonald's. Not just McDonald's,but most fast food places around the country. Of course there are exceptions. This place really drops the ball. It's very sad to see. This place looks like a dump. These are very strong words I regret to say. Though they are very accurate. I should have taken pictures.",0
"If it were possible to give negative stars. Theirs would still be off the chart.

It never fails that I am not returning my order.. And PLEASE.TEACH CASHIERS TO COUNT BACK CHANGE... IM ALWAYS SHORT!!!!",0
The cashier was confused. I was so upset that I left without eating.,0
I ain't never been here dawg,0

"This is place is always crowded with homeless ppl and their belongings. The clerk taking your order is always impatient as if they have something way better to do than assist you, and to top it off the dining hours end at 5pm so if you're not driving through drive thru, tough luck.. save your money and go to another local McDonald's or the Farmer Boys less than a block away.",0
"Homeless was harassing my uber customer and I told the person who took the orders at the window, black African American guy, and he didn't care to say something to the homeless. It's a dangers spot, especially at night. I hope the corporate office does something about it. Homeless guy was cleaning the windshield of a car that litterly on the drive through and he was at next to the window while he was cleaning the windshield. Employee never said a word to the homeless. I thought I was in a gas station for a moment. Very poor service. Fire the employee. Saturday night at 1am",0
Placed a mobile order and it went through. I ordered large fries but then the manager refused to give me my order because their system was down. I showed her my order and she still refused. She said I should cancel it. When I asked how she said she didn't know how. Horrible service,0
Way over priced. They recycle their fries now because every time I go to one of these places the fries are cold and chewy. The double cheeseburgers taste as though they were microwaved. I don't know I think they're trying to save money or something but it's not going to work for me anymore. Especially at the sky high prices. Sorry no can do,0
The inside is always closed and never open the drive-thru line is always long and they do not provide a sign saying that the inside of the restaurant is closed but we're paying $15 for a meal.... They also had an employee that was sitting in there I tapped on the window to ask her where they open she rode her eyes and turned her head people should do that when they're at work 占쏙,0
In a high crime area. Homeless begging for handouts at the drive-thru and even robberies in the parking lot. Drug paraphernalia litters the parking lot. Security is very helpful considering they have no LAPD support.,0

This is the closest location to where I live so we order often from here and it's always the same problem... missing items from our order.

Gave me an uncooked Mc chicken gave me food poisoning,0
I'm a McDonalds fan boy and this McDonalds is my least favorite in Los Angeles if not the entire United States. It used to be average/ middle of the road as far as MCD goes but recently it's tanked and I wouldn't suggest going here anymore. I'd rather eat at the McDonalds in the airport.,0
Hate having to come to this place the staff is quick but they allow people to aggressively beg for money food anything they can say the drive thru sign and all throughout the parking lot of you don't roll down your window which u have to eventually bc is a drive thru. They will come to your car and they will knock on your window as is you might not be able to hear them or know they are there already should not be allowed.   At all,0
my uber eats fries were older than the toe jam between my grandmas toes. and i am missing cookies i ordered... lame!,0
Horrible place bad service. I ordered at 3:40am didn't get my order until 4:13 I was missing half my order and when I told them they had the nerve to say they will replace it for breakfast items because they no longer serve lunch. It's not my fault they can't do their job correct and get orders right!,0
"Saturday night is mostly a young staff working drive thru, line is always around the building, when I got to the window, I was handed 3/4 of my drink, the other drinks were all filled 3/4 full, I ordered 4 happy meals none of them had toys I asked for the toys and they did not want to give them to me. I gave them back all the happy meals and asked for new ones with toys, fries were not salted at all I could see the fry guy trying to fill the salt shaker and could not. A manager had to fill it and they never did salt them.",0

Staff were chuckling that we were upset.",0
I'm catching the Greyhound across the street and can't order breakfast until 9 a.m. This is ludicrous.  Now I'm not sure when I'll be able to eat again.  Most restaurants cater to the location. If you have a bus station around the corner set your danm hours according to their schedule.,0
"I work a couple blocks away and go here like three or more times a week. Lately, they have been letting me down. I understand mistakes happen but if I come back the next day and say 퐃ey, you charged me for a double quarter pounder and only gave me a regular quarter pounder?maybe don tell me yeah well if you don",0
"I mean McDonald's is McDonald's as far as the food is concerned fast , delicious and convenient. The only problem with this particular McDonald's is the homeless population which of is no fault of McDonald's but you just have to be alert when going through the drive thru or dining in this location it can be quite dangerous at times the pan handlers can be very aggressive at times and confrontational. So beware if you come to this location.",0
"Could only take cash. I hardly remember the feel of actual cash. I think it was a little rough... a little clothy... but the SMELL of cash... I can never forget the smell... Either way, couldn't order.",0

I went to this McDonalds . Ordered two deluxe spicy chicken sandwiches with fries and drinks!,0
I go to this McDonald a lot of times and never had a problem until tonight. I ordered a McMuffin like always but this time the quality was not there. The bread was hard to bite and not fresh at all. It seems like they just,0
"THEE worse kind of employees I've ever experienced -- food always cold & obviously not fresh when I do finally receive it after a long wait. Homeless people everywhere begging for cigs, money and not food which I offered to give one of the homeless my left overs but he declined even though he was asking for money for food to buy -- obviously that was a lie and really didn't want the money for food.",0
"TERRIBLE service. Stopped by this place 3 times at about 1am hour. First time the lady messed up my order so bad and when I asked her to correct it she still got it wrong. But hey...it was 1am I get it. Nope...came back a week later and this time the drive thru person couldn't understand English at all. I tried and tried to get her to understand my order and nothing. I have no problems with the language barrier but this was just unacceptable for a window worker. Third time was tonight. Got here early this time - they close at 9pm. It was 8:30 and doors were already locked inside and out. The worker just stood their ignoring everyone even though they are supposed to close 30 min from now.

In summary
1- untrained workers who either cant speak English/dont pay attention to orders
2- service takes FOREVER
3- lazy and disorganized workers who close way too early.

Avoid this place!!!",0
The worst McDonald's to ever exist. Infested with homeless people. Laziest workers. Horrible customer service. Its a miracle they are even operating. Takes them 10 minutes per customer. So much for fast food. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this horrible establishment,0
"Worst location and the employees are lazy. Rent a cop dude wants to act like he owns the lobby. Closed way before time all due to their laziness. All peasantry working at this location. No sense of customer service, starting with the managers themselves.",0
"Due to covid19, no sitting inside. Really needed to use restroom, had to buy something (which is not at all how Mcdonald's across the US operates) they make money from their orders from the long line of drive thru's, cut the families some slack. 6 people in my family, spending the day in LA and was just grateful to see McDonald, but no. Come to find out local shops more open and friendly than this.",0
Do not go here for lunch worst service in Los Angeles and dirty restaurant gross Cashiers have attitudes and never get your order right two thumbs down and negative stars just stay your lazy behind home if you don't want to work and do your job right.,0
"Terrible service
Receipt does not print out
No table service
Forgot hash brown
Forgot late

All this on an order for 2 people!",0
2nd time coming and same quality kind of food. Stale fries so dry so black. The sweet iced tea tastes like someone did not clean it before making the drink. Time stamp 12:50 pm.  I warn everyone do not eat here.,0
Worst McDonald's I ever been at...twice that I been there they for got part of my orders...They really don't care about the customer...whenI asked about my missing part of the order they looked at me like what else,0
Fool's not hot enough expensive when you ask him to give you a burger and you tell him no ketchup no pickles no onions and then they give you anytime you want mayonnaise lettuce and tomato they charge you extra,0
Horrible horrible avoid this place 15 mins to place a order thru drive thru!!!! Sitting inside isn't available,0
Ordered tonight and it took too long to be delivered and then it was completely wrong. Tried calling and no answer. Get it together!,0
"I'm from a foreign place and I just happened to stop in this McDonalds for a quick bite. These are the things I noticed. #1. Active on site security inside the establishment. I felt like I was being scrutinized. I assume shady things go on here. #2. I found out this McDonalds is located in an area called skid row. #3. The price of the food here is above the average price of the rest of the united states of america. #4. There isn't really a lot of friendly interaction between the clerk and the guest as well. For the most part this is what I gathered from this place. Taking into account that it was the first and only time I've been there. Not a good representation for Los Angeles for it being so close to the Greyhound bus station portal. If its any consolation , I received my food hot and it was good.",0
"Do not go to this McD, so nasty! I don't understand how anyone can eat inside this place, it smelled like rotten fish! We paid 25c to get in the restroom which it's fine because there are some many homeless out side they want to keep them from using them, even though they were also dirty they did not smell  as bad as the  dinning! So we went in used rr n left!gross. Outside this guy chased us to our car asking for money",0
Sad to say the slightest customer service I got here was from the security guard food here is horrible server/cashier need to be fired get ignore for the talk to among their selves than act like working but just standing around.Ive gave better customer service when I've worked at a McDonald's before.This just my experience nothing can change my mind to ever to come back to this location again,0
I do not like this place me and my two grandchildren went to eat and  we asked if we can please get the table clean and they took 10min to 25min just to clean the tables we kept asking them but they did not clean the tables we asked for it to go because they were working slow than we get the fries bured we said hey can we get fries the are cooked 100% they said sorry all we have is burned fries we had wait even more longer to get our fresh fries,0
"Worst McDonald's I've ever been to. Every time I go there I Feel as though I am being judged because I decide ro walk to it after I get out or work after 10pm. They are very rude and never plesejt nor fonthey saybtyank you or have manora what so ever. I was flat out refused service one time because I walked to this place and needed to go through the drive through.
I have a perfectly working car but use that time to exercise by walking down there.
I'm also asked at least twice before and twice after I get my food for money every single time I to there by people asking for a hand outs. Its very uncomfortable. That is not an exaggeration either. Can't the security who work there try protecting your customers from being harassed instead of being on their cell phone all the time?
You guys are literally my last option when it comes to getting some thing to eat around where I live because of how uncomfortable it is to go there. There's a lot of people who avoid this place for those reasons too. I'm defiantly not the only one.",0
"The absolute worst McDonald's I've ever been to. And I'm not one to complain. Every time I've been through the drive-thru, I've had to wait nearly 30 minutes for my food. And every time I'm speaking into the drive thru window, the person taking my order needs to repeat my order to me several times due to the language barrier. On top of that, I attempted to go eat in-store about 20 minutes ago and found that the lobby was already closed. The lobby was not to be closed until 9 p.m., and they closed it about 30 minutes prior. I have not had any positive experiences at this particular McDonalds. Corporate needs to do something about this location.",0
"Worst service ever. Took 35 minutes to get through the drive through and both window 1 guy & window 2 girl gave me attitude. Window 1 couldn't get my order right and their drive through screen didn't display my simple order. And then Window 2 lady gave me the wrong sauce EVEN AFTER CONFIRMING WHAT I ASKED FOR WITH HER! Fire all of them, shut down this location, and board up the building. Do it now.",0
Drive thru service is always slow at this location.  I paid for my order at 645am (and i know because i have my receipt) but i got my food at 703am (and this i know because i had to return a juice at 704am and i have a receipt for that as well)... 20 minutes of wait aside from the extra time i had to wait in line to get to the order speaker and then to the paying window.   the only reason i waited is because i like to leave,0
Homeless fighting in parking lot and harassing customers for money. Dining area is messy and dirty. It took 15 minutes to get my order. A worker was behind the counter eating ice cream cone dripping it all over the place and herself,0
They got my whole order wrong even after we corrected them they still purposely messed up the order leaving out some ingredients. One of the employees told me that everyone was mad because they have to go to another store to pick up their checks. Don,0
"If I could I wouldn't even give one star to this location , employees are very rude and disrespectful. I dont understand how they get away by not getting discipline .
They need a huge training on customers satisfaction skills .otherwise they should look for a different kind of work where they dont have to be seen to avoid their behavioral issues at the workplace",0
Homeless people harass you while at the drive thru to buy them food. Very sad situation.,0
"Every time I go to this McDonalds near me they are rude and never smile. I don't mind so much but once in a while would be nice. It's the first place I came to eat once I moved here which wasn't a good sign and completely turned me off from a place I used to love to come to eat at.
Plus the homeless situation is out of control here. How about the security Dallas get off their phone and do their job? I literally haven't gone since in weeks because I'm asked for either a smoke, money or food every single time I go through drive-through. I'm sorry but I can't be buying someone else food everytime I go here. I just can't afford it.",0
"Gosh the ""manager"" Claudia has a nasty ghetto attitude. She has no idea of what leave your problems at home is. I had order a quarter pounder combo and the cashier charged me wrong. when i pull to the second window of the drive through she said W/ATTITUDE ""YOU OWE ME"" 5 something. I asked why was she screaming and been rude and she kept talking giving attitude to me and immediately took it after the 1st cashier. Wow.. Coming to this spot NEVER AGAIN. I should of gone to Urth yet so close.. smh..",0
"The ebt machine did not work so I used cash but they couldn't give me the correct change because they were out so they tried to short me at first .. I did not get syrup with my breakfast, the sink did not work in the restroom, the security guard was cursing at the customers who are all homeless people, a lady hooked up speakers in the restroom.. I don't get it, I felt like I was in the twilight zone",0
Very nice inside and clean.... But why do they allow homeless people just to sit and not purchase food? Paying customers need to sit! Not coming to this location again.,0
Computer says no. No walking through the drive through even though I identify as a car.,0
What a rippoff?  I order a quarter pounder.  There was no lettuce.  Looked like a small cheese burguer.   Ugly French fries.  In Canada I could eat a better meal than this.,0
"If i could give them 0 starts i would, they messed up my order and then when i took it back it took them another 10 min to re do it. Plus i was waiting for my order the first time for like 6-10 min, it was thru drive thru. Not satisfied at all",0
"Fries under cooked
Chicken nuggets over cooked,  always messing up my order and this us 4th time ,never coming back just horrible service.",0
Im giving it a 1 star because i bought a lot of burgers and fries and they only gave me 2 ketchups. I asked for more ketchup the worker said they cant give more it was  mcdonalds  rules.  MCdonalds is making it hard to enjoy these burgers and fries with no ketchup.,0
There is a security guard/cop standing around and he makes me feel unsafe for some reason. A black bum was harrassing me and tell cop looked on. It's not walker friendly as there is a gate around the outside. At least it was clean on the inside.,0

"Worst people serving . I think the homeless people are nicer . And I'm upset because the guys act as though I'm not going to pay for the toy I asked for.  This is a horrible place to eat . So just take your food yo go , here.",0
"I sat in the dining room before ordering any food for 5 minutes to catch my breath after walking 5 miles. Security guy approached me saying "" hey man  if you want to sit in here you need to buy something right now if not u need to go back the way you just came"". Guess what I'm the one who decides what, when and where do I buy something.",0
Worst service ever! Walk up to counter wasnt acknowledged at all. Went to electronic order screen still had to walk to counter to pay took a # for sit down order they didnt bring my food and called out wrong # plus no where to charge phones at all....,0
They need too go back too school and learn how too count they give you the wrong change and still take forever. COUNT YOUR CHANGE PEOPLE BEFORE YOU LEAVE.,0
Macdonald on Alameda and seven street employees can eat inside but customers not so don't go there you can't eat inside ,0
"Food predictable -- it's McDonald's. However, I went through drive-up and had 2 vagrants panhandling at my window WHILE I WAS TRYING TO PAY!!  A SECURITY GUARD STOOD BY AND SAID NOTHING, and server said nothing. I told them to get away from my window, and one got loud and stupid. Finally the server told them, ""Wait over there or i won't serve you."" They moved. If i was with my family, i would have never opened my window, then left without paying. Since it was just me and my dog, and i was hungry, i put up with their nonsense.",0
Just order from here with uber eats for the first time and i received my food in a timely fashion but while i was eating my big mac i found a hair in it i made a complain to uber and i have called McDonald's 4 times and no one picks up the only reason i dont go to the store and complain is because im at work and cant leave my job active security guard,0
The slowest drive true that ever been. I was in line for about 20 and they were only 4 cars ahead of me,0

I assume you need a high school diploma to work at McDonalds. But this place never gets the order right. Asked for two iced coffees. One with sugar and the other without. I got 2 coffees with no sugar. And top it off no straws. Thanks McDonalds for making it harder for us so you can get your 15 an hour. Geeesh Loouuiiies you guys should ve getting paid 8 an hour. No questions asked.,0

This good isn't good for anyone if you can avoid at all costs,0
Gave me the wrong cafe latte.,0
They wouldn't serve me at drive through because I don't have a car & am homeless.  That is inhuman & illegal.  I ll starve to death then.  I haven't eaten in 2 days.,0
Their bathroom facilities were horrible... No food place should have that much disgust; makes you think about not eating there!!,0
"I stopped by for a number 1 at McDonald's and got a cold big Mac and a hard bun, In n Out has never given me a cold burger, I should know better.",0
"The expression on the clerk's face is like you owe him a lot of money. There are many homeless inside and outside the store, and the dining environment is very bad.",0
"The dining area was not clean, and there were drug addicts, and homeless people in the dining area asking for food. security just sat around harassing African Americans.",0
Did the self order through the kiosk to avoid the line and still waited almost 30min for my food due to them having given out my order to someone else the first time.,0
High prices. And the food is sub par. I don't ask for much but I do expect my food to be warm. Do better Mc Donalds.,0

Even the manger looked high
Management needs to drug test everyone in there",0

Needed to be cleaner I dining area place...had to grab something before grabbing bus greyhound but food was hot and behind counter was ok.,0
The queues are like for sausage in the spring in these McDonald's ... as if they give them out for free ... and the employees save ...,0
"Infested with homeless people, and crazy druggies!!! DO NOT GO HERE!!!! There was a naked homeless man in front of the drive thru and front door area!!! Was so bad I decided to save my money and hold my pee!!!",0

Here at this McDonald's it took close to 25 minutes to get two McDoubles a dr. Pepper and an Oreo McFlurry,0
Horrible customer service I had to wait more than 40minutes to get my food because the manager is arguing with the customer in front of me and then he threw a couple water at her and she threw one back and this is not the only time I had to wait for my food the only reason why I come to this mc Donald's is because it's near my job and there's always too many homeless people ordering at the window  ,0
Went in this morning they got my order all wrong charged me more then what it suppose to cost . When I brought ,0

Taste was normal but overall not even close McDonald's quality.",0
"One of two McDonald's stores in whole mid/south Miami Beach area so you know what to expect.

It's dirty, restroom has no water or soap to wash hands, except if you use the handicap toilet which makes me wonder how often or ever the employees wash their hands before return back to work. My husband got quite sick the following day because of the food.

We placed the order on the machine for dine-in with table service but there was not a single table # tent available, well the store make it clear that you as a customer should better pickup your own food at the counter. There's absolutely no service at all.

We will never ever go back to this McDonald's ever again.",0
"Food was ok.
For service I would give 0 stars if I could. Rudeness started with the manager and continued with the staff. Everyone seemed very bothered to be there. Asked for an extra napkin and nobody would bother to respond.

The problem I have with this location is that it's always dirty in the lobby area and bathroom. Second hardly anyone speaks English there and my Spanish is horrible so it's hard ordering food sometimes. The service is quick and food is usually hot and I had a problem once with the wrong order. Check the lobby area and bathroom more frequently and use bilingual cashiers.,0
Saturday April 1st.  It's suppose to be 24 hrs for Google as google appear. And they close at 5:00 am . What the manager is doing? So poor management.  Employee told me funking drunk. I'm wrong? I don't know because I drive depending on hours on Google.,0

Absolutely terrible quality control. How anyone thinks this is ok to send to paying customers is mind blowing.,0
"Very busy location, of course, it's Miami Beach!
Typical Miami Beach Service attitude 4 out of 5 times when I have picked up an online order at this location, I am the positive, harmony seeking butterfly type of customer, that walks in for pick up, greets the human behind the counter with respect and a smile, to than receive this nasty, Miami B!tch attitude that makes you regret not sticking to your fastfood free diet in an instant..
Is it really hard to hire friendly and customer oriented personnel?!  There are so many seeking employment..
At least teach em to pretend to be nice to customers! That includes Managers, btw.
Further, putting staff on the front counter who fairly understands English is just not fair to them and me, the customer that just wants to pick up an order and leave fast. 'Cause Fast Food you know. Love the Sweet Tea, def. missed the lemon slices, sadly not on their Menu at this Location.
Still lovin' it!",0
"Came on 06/03/2023 at 10pm. So many things were out of stock, including Happy Meals, McChicken and Hot&Spicy McChicken, smaller portion of nuggets (only from 10pieces), large fries but no medium, etc?Why ? Lack of packaging ?

Came there with a toddler. Pretty sad.

But the worse to come?Never ever be disappointed with the taste of the fries. Ok. Those can be sometimes old, McDonalds products are fresh for 10 minutes only. Fries were mushy, and the taste was nasty. Same nasty taste on the nuggets",0
"Rude customer service. Some people should get fired. They make threats. And put spit in the food, I had a traumatized experience here they put spit in my food and sent people to follow me all the way back to my hotel room saying they'll put spit in my food again. Worst place to eat at",0
"Stayed downtown stopped for sandwich and coke. Coke machine was broken; homeless all over the lobby, bathrooms had homeless in and out with obvious drug use. Employee was too worried about the bathroom door lock and messed up a 2 sandwhich order. Manager quickly fixed. Typical big city overpriced trashy fast food place. Felt like I was back in New York City.",0
"We went to this mcdonalds to grab a quick bite, first of all the service was horrible, they do not know what they are doing. Second the food was cold.

So I ordered  on the take out screen ...a coffee and sweet tea ...several times at this location Miami beach..I like my sweet and not just some milky tasting drink. So I select my sugar count and and creamer ..out all times they only got it correct once. Here today and the girl didn't follow the instructions on her screen. She just chose the amount she was going to put I watched her. Then I went up to ask for extra packets and the girl act like she did not hear me at first then gave me 2 packets. So McDonald's either you guys are going to stop being tight with your condiments..and put them out for your customers to grab if needed extra ..and if your employees refuse to follow directions,0

"MOST INCOMPETENT MCDONALDS EVER

THEY ALWAYS FORGET OR CONFUSE PUTTING SAUCES IN YOUR FOOD

Yesterday we went there ordering the 40 McNuggets with 2 fries deal. We selected four different sauces. When we unpacked the stuff at the beach, we found they gave us only 2 instead of 4 sauces. And these were 2 ranch, while we ordered different sauces. Also we got just 1 instead of 2 fries. Next day we ordered a happy mal and again the nuggets sauce was missing as well as the ketchup! I cant wrap my head around how employees can be so incompetent. The guys responsible for packing the sauces should be taught a lesson.",0
"Oooooo it was ghetto and they gave me the last of the fry batch, they didn have much available, and it must",0
Absolutely no employees speak English.  We waited over 20 minutes on our food and had to utilize Google Translator for the employees to understand we had not received our order.,0
Before you can make it in McDonald's there's quite a few people asking for a handout. Only self service kiosks. No soap in the bathrooms. How are the employees washing their hands? Skip this one.,0
"The dirtiest McDonold I have ever been. Waited for 8 mins with no one to serve even though 2 staffs were standing there and see me waiting. The place is so dirty and I am not sure how they pass hygiene. They do not allow to order medium, only large at night. One of my order was not in the bag. When I checked the receipt, I noticed they have placed a wrong order. I told them about it, they said they don have the item and refused to give refunds when I told them I do not want the wrong order. No apology and lie about I ever placed order they put in.  Very rude and ignorant. She did not speak English but deny about putting wrong order and accused me of placing order that I would never have placed. Food was cold and bread was hard as burn. Horrible experience with them and wish McD franchiser will take their license away. It is a disgrace to the brand. The management is so bad and I find the whole experience to be unbelievable. Readck your order but best advice is, NOT to go there at all.",0
Literally locked the door on my face. I never write reviews but this was so strange. Was attempting to purchase breakfast and there was an employee who physically pushed me out and locked the door. Completely unwarranted given my calm demeanor. Very bizarre.,0
"Hygiene is very bad.  The cleaning lady - afroamerican women-  today at 14:15 was slow and unpleasant.

I've brought my concerns to the attention of the management staff and no changes; no one seems to care.

The staff basically are not interested in serving you, they don't want to work. Manager is not interested and rest rooms are permanently closed....is this even legal? It is telling that none of the staff wear their name badges. I visited the premises on 5th July 2018 at 8.45am Seriously McDonalds...you need to close this branch down...you cannot continue to offer service this bad under your company logo.

Missing 2 collectibles. Which is the point of the whole meal! And they gave me nuggets instead of the big Mac I ordered.

Pure disappointment.  Shame.",0
"Worst McDonald ever. Very dirty, restroom are awful, disgusting and inhabitable. HQ should do something",0
Rude staff! An employee is going from table to table asking to do a review on your cell phone! She has a handful of duplicate receipts and is giving the store good reviews... Please tear this location down and build a new one! The blonde in the white shirt is a smiling crook! She is supposed to be a manager. UPDATE: Their is none占쏙,0
One of the worst McDonald I hav,0
Rest room was out of order in such a popular location,0
"Worst McDonald's branch ever!
The drinks are pre poured and placed on a table and by the time i get your drink its all out of bubbles. The seller by the cash register was on her phone the whole order and I had to repeat my order several times which made me feel disrespected and a little irritated.",0
"May be it is time for people to take the time to report this location to the headquarter website!
Again missing the sauce for the Mc nuggets ! Not only I am paying for them as they are part of my menu and the mc nuggets are pretty disgusting with no sauce whatsoever. Since this is a recurrent missing item at each order, I have a question.
Is it the food cost monitoring or a real operation issue ?
May be have them put by the person packaging the mc nuggets instead of the cashier!!!!!!!!!",0
There were 10 people behind the register.  None of them can count to six? I did not order five nuggets. FYI. McDonald's on Washington Ave; the sweet requires sugar.,0
Experience world renowned burgers and fry占쏙,0
"A horrible McDonald's restaurant. It's dirty, service was bad, strange people walk in and out all the time, overall the place looks out dated. It seemed that they blocked some of the cheaper items from the menu around diner time, for example they did not serve the Happy meal with 4 pieces of chicken nuggets. That one was 'out of stock', although the did sell the Happy meal with 6 pieces chicken nugget. What a joke.
If you look for a nice place to eat with your kids, go somewhere else.",0
How can they have about 20 employees behind the counter and run into stock issues. Everything is sold out. Poor management I say.,0
"McDonald's excels at friendly service and inexpensive, but good quality, food. This franchise has none of that. The staff was efficient enough, but distant and surly. I had two meals there. Both times my food was too cold to eat.

One problem may be the groups of loud and rude teenagers that hang out there. The backs from a long banquette are missing leaving wood laths that poke the back.

All of that is unfortunate because this franchise has a perfect location to shine.",0
"Hello,

I hope this email finds you to inform you that your staff needs to be engaged in coaching due to the lack of attention to a female and I needing to use the restrooms after multiple attempts to utilize them. I was ignored by the first female and was given a puzzled look that they can't be opened. After I went around to seek attention from the other staff she rudely stated both bathrooms are not available, after I asked why she said "" they just are "". I asked to see what would cause them to be unusable but could only feel discriminated as she added no urgency to the issue. She then asked if I was management to even request to see the inside of the bathrooms. As a LONG TIME CUSTOMER. I suggest to keep your client based loyal to address this issue as it leaves a bad image on the franchise. I left feeling ""I didn't have it my way "". And that's just a bowl movement. Thank you for your time and I hope this matter has been addressed the next time I pass by the store as I will try to obtain pictures of the staff reluctant to assist.

Best regards,

JJ.",0
"its not 24 hours, its centeral location for all homeless people i feel bad for them but they make the place discosting, they all live inside and by 7 am they use free bathroom, smells bad in side and front of the place some homelss demand that u buy them food, management is week and no police around only homeless and druge dealrs.",0
Its been a fixture on Washington Ave for years and it looks like it. The clientele at McDonald's is never good but never quite as bad as beggars seated at doorways with signs pointed towards you. If you like going to McDonald's in NYC at rush hour then this is the spot for you.,0
"Too busy, machines don",0
"Terrible service. I put in curbside pickup for the mobile order. Waiting for nearly half an hour. A staff walked out and said I cannot park here for more than 15 minutes, and this is for curbside pickup only. I explained and showed the receipt that I put in as curbside pickup. She still did not look and proceeded to tell me I am wrong. Terrible service.",0
"The restaurant was very dirty, the order was incomplete and my daughter was sad because she didn't receive her Happy Meal's toy. Additionally, we ate as fast as possible because there was a homeless intimidating the guests and the employees didn't do anything. We felt very insecure eating there",0
"Cashier refuse to sale.
In this location just one credit card machine works, but they have two register... The other one cashier refuse to open it or use it... So why you guys have 2 register for.....
Seems like cashiers determinate who can eat or not.... Shame on you",0
The worst McDonald's to go to....the Fries look like they just heated them up and served...not even cool throughly....super lazy people...and have a lot of attitude...do not go here,0
"This location had no happy meals for my 6 year old, higher prices than normal around the city and had drunk people sitting all throughout the restaurant and many asking me for money while with my son. I feel bad as they looked homeless, did help one guy out, but most were intoxicated and making a mess, not being polite at all. They need to clean that up as it scared some kids and also makes you uncomfortable. I've had this Happen every visit to this location.",0
No interest in this location. No testing foods.,0
This place is RACIST. They do what they want to do in there!!  The food is never fresh and the workers are very rude to the customers and when you have a problem with your food they tell you to leave and don come back. All the works and the managers are all ,0
I was waiting 20 mins for a order that been ready im in the front for like 15mins I never heard my order called up and the guys says that they been called my order like they don't do their job right and they want to lie to my face,0
Worst McDonald's I've ever been to the people do not speak English a good majority of them and so they will not even try to answer your question they just walk away and ignore you they are not open 24 hours that is a lie it says confirmed by the company but that is not true as they were closed at 6:00 a.m. and said they don't open till 7:00 a.m. although their door says open 24 hours that's a lie and if you knock on the door they just ignore you the most ignorant McDonald's employees I have ever encountered.,0
"Should be 'Minus star -*' . Except for the manager, otherwise;  Totally shocking staff, you would double check if you are in the United States. The serving girls treat people as unwanted guests in their own house, not serving people, they would fight with 1/2 of the customers, sending for police 2 or 3 times daily. Slow service, and bad manners, you  would feel like a kid getting his food from his angry mother, with some cursing whispers that you don't understand ' in Spanish' . Totally crazy.",0
"Bad experience, bad grade, that's the game. The ordering machine does not issue a ticket to justify his order but especially his payment.",0
"Ordered on Uber Eats, 4 different delivery person took the order but they all canceled since the food was never ready. They never finished my order after waiting for 2 hours. This is highly unacceptable, such a poor service for the location of the place. I expected something better from being one of the only McDonald",0
"Absolutely, without pause, the WORST excuse for a McDonalds I've seen. No coffee. No chicken sandwiches. No restroom. No seating. Dirty. Rude people wearing McDonald's uniform.(normally their titles would be employee/workers. That may suggest they earned their wage!)",0
"Really poor mcdonalds - service is fast, but they normally get the order wrong, and aren't as friendly as in new york restaurants.",0
"Almost all tables were dirty, bathrooms were gross, there was a pair of dirty socks on the floor. Food was good though but they need to improve on the cleanliness of their restaurant.",0
"Came to Miami for vacation being here just wanted something quick. They took forever to give us our food, the dinning area was filthy and around 9:50pm I went back to order something else and the cashier was being rude and unprofessional denying me the service saying they were already closed and couldn take anymore orders. I would understand if I was outside but I was already inside and expending money. W",0
I feel bad writing this review..  The workers seemed very confused one lady in the 15 minutes I spent in the location stood by the soda machine in a daze. She wasn't even the one who gave us our drinks. I would really like to find out what her purpose was. The food came out cold with exception of fries. The manager looked so frustrated I hesitated to return the order. Terrible,0
"No restrooms. The employees use them though, so only customers can't. Is that even legal to operate without restroom? Most employee are rude and ignore you when you ask for ketchup or anything",0
The service is horrible I ordered on the kiosk then waited 13 minutes  in line to pay. There was only one person on front of me. Employees rude to customers.  At least the food was fresh . Well as fresh  as McDonald's  can be.,0
"Terrible experience!! They were out of milk, out of chocolate milk, out of toys for the happy meals for the kids and out of juice which they had to replace with this awful tasting fountain juice. It took about 15-20 minutes to get three happy meals for the kids. The washrooms were dirty, no hand towels, no toilet paper and the hands air dryers did not work! The staff however were nice and very helpful, the reason for my 2 stars!",0
Be careful. Rude sketchy employees.They will try to tell you at certain times of nite every order has to be upsized to a large. Food was cold and horrible after a long wait. Then you still will be  GROSSLY OVERCHARGED. Crooks. USE THE APP TO BE CHARGED CORRECTLY.,0
"the worst attention you can receive is here attention -99 Service -99 ask for salt, they give you sugar, the staff is extremely contemptuous, they almost throw the food at you and the chicken burnt if you want to lose your money this is the ideal place",0
"This store is dirty, the staff are rude and stood around talking and on their phones.  Very rude and heard several customer complain.",0
"I would give ZERO stars if that was possible. FILTHY bathroom, no soap in the stall with changing table was ripped off the wall, hand dryer didn't work no way to dry your hands. Would never go back there. Employees not very helpful and rolled their eyes when I formed them they gave sweet tea to my diabetic husband who ordered unsweetened.",0
The workers were so beyond disrespectful! My daughter and I stopped in for a drink and to order food we were going to wash our and purshase before we could use the rest room.Then ALL the staff spoke so disrespectful and embarrassed ushands and or 'll Dr her food.Tge worker told me only customers were allowed I expresses that we needed to was our hands before eating and the workers told us ow well we qould have to atand in linw,0
"I went at 11 a.m at tooks almost 25 minutes to get mi meal. Very poor attention.
Second time (2022) I went to this Mac and the situation is the same that 4 years ago... I think is't worst... very dirty, disorder everywhere, completelly full, bad mood in general. That morning took me 45 minutes to get my breakfast. I promise, will never come back.",0
"I've upgraded my review to 2 stars because in my drunken kindness I gave this place a second chance. One of the only good employees seems like he got promoted to manager and this place seems to be visitable now. I'll return again to see for sure, because before it was definitely a terrible experience consistently.",0
"Wow!  To say that we had a bad experience would be a compliment.  The food was cold, they ran out of ice and carbonation--yes, no carbonation for the sodas!!...and they still kept serving them--we counted at least 10 returned drinks in a10 minute spam.  Worst of all, the manager offered no apologies.  Run, don't just walk away from this place!",0
i thought they closed this location down. i cant believe i get to still read the reviews on this store and laugh. they need to keep up the filth and rude customer service cause these comments are like comedy when you are bored.,0
"Absolutely disgusted with discriminatory management at this location. As I'm charging my phone in back making an order on app because I didnt have my card. The manager, Nancy, request their ""security"" to kick me out. I did absolutely nothing wrong other than charge my phone to make an order.

Not only did their security guard get rude with me they didnt even have the professionalism to let me know it's against rules to charge phone to make an order. Only was charging to phone to make order thru app. Then after getting kicked out they wouldn't give me a refund or my food, said to call number.

Me being black I deal with this a lot. But I hope reviews like this can help wake people up and hold people accountable for discriminatory behavior.

Still want my refund!!!",0
"I can't give it less than 1 star, otherwise I would have! The staff have no idea what they're doing, they walk around gaumlessly offering no help. The counter is like a mosh pit. Nothing works. Avoid if you can or hope it's not busy at all otherwise you're in for a long wait with the wrong order by the end of it!",0
"My only visit to this shop and I witnessed these: 1) There were two lines but suddenly one of the staff members stopped taking orders and closed the point-of-sales machine.  Those customers on that line were told to go at the back of the other line.
2) I understand that some staff are new but the supervisor or senior staff are rude to the new staff and do not help train them.  I don understand the yelling (probably because they are in Spanish).
3) Majority of staff speak Spanish and announce numbers in Spanish.  Expect some misunderstanding when they are taking your order too.  One of the staff put in hot coffee when I ordered hot coffee.
4) Be prepared to wait in a long line and always check your order before you leave the pick up counter.  It was my fault that I did not check/realize my Big Mac and South West salad dressing are missing when I felt.

TLDR?; just don쐬羲s will always be a bad decision anyway.",0
This is the most horrible place I have been to. A guy walked out as we walked complaining he had waited 10 minutes for a soda. The guy on the register was so rude. Very under staffed. Homeless sleeping on the chairs. We ordered 2 coffees and 2 frappes  and waited so long to get them all at different times. I worked at one in NZ  and we would be fired for this kind of thing straight away!,0
"If I could give this place 0 stars, believe me, I would. By far the worst McDonald's I have EVER been to in the world. I came in to buy a bottle of water (would never even consider eating here given the lack of cleanliness). I waited about five minutes until someone finally told me that they do not have any bottles left. I told them a large fountain water was fine, with ice. Keep in mind - MAYBE 2 people at this McDonald's speak English. Luckily this woman understood me when I communicated what I wanted. I watched her get the cup, fill it with ice, and place it beside the machine! For someone that is just waiting for a drink, pour it, and hand it to the customer. There were maybe a dozen people waiting for their orders. I did not have any other items to wait for - just the water. I waited another 5 minutes to see if someone would just hand me the cup. No one did. I pushed my way through to the front, and got my cup. It was absolute chaos in there; a brutally unorganized establishment. The cashier could have simply turned around, gotten me the bottle of water (or in this case, tell me there are none and pour me a fountain drink), and be on my way. Wasted 10-15 minutes in this place.",0
"Not very good service. Unique location but a lot of mismanagement. Some of the crew do not acknowledge you, they'll look at you and walk by while you're trying to get their attention, but keep walking and check on the fries or smoothie machine, then go do something else. I ordered a mobile order which I never did hear my order number called until I inquired about it and the team leader (or ""manager"") said ""I said [mobile order], but you never came up."" I was like there could've been several mobile orders, you weren't specific. And theres constantly food and trash on the floor being picked up, it reminds me of a GTA game.",0
This was hands down the SLOWEST McDonald's I have ever been to in the whole world. The kitchen was full of employees so I'm not sure why they didn't have their act together.,0
"Hope you have a lot of time because the wait here is unbelievable, placing an order alone took  me 15 minutes, I work nearby, and 5 out of 5 times I've been here in the overnight time they
Weren't serving coffee,  any items on the value menu, or any grilled items. Not to mention how filthy it is. Also always understaffed. Horrible experience, I don't usually eat McDonalds but working as an overnight around the area is one of the only places open, has been like this for as long as I could remember. Reason for this review is because it's unacceptable that they don't have coffee or value menu items available at nighttime when they should. Wish I could give it -stars.",0
"I ordered a latte from the Miami Beach Lincoln road branch and waited for my drink. I saw my number flash up on the screen but no one called me. I went up and asked the woman (short reddish hair) who was calling out the order numbers if my number had been called. The answer was no. I kept waiting and still nothing. I asked her again but I was rudely ignored due to her having a chat with her friend. I asked several different people working there about my latte but they all said it's coming and moved on. The staff were either rude, indifferent and just no longer interested in me after I had paid. People came and went with their orders and I was left waiting for my one latte. I said to one woman how long does it take to make a latte? She looked at my ticket and of course no one had even started making it. I was disgusted with the truly terrible customer service. If u want good service do not go to this mcdonalds.",0
Went here for a late night snack stop on Uber back to hotel. Shows 24/7 hours but the place was closed. Ended up having to get two Uber and pay twice as much as a result.,0
"Horrible service. Ridiculous wait time. Waited such a long time for an ice cream cone. They have over 10 people working and yet they're slow. They have someone who prepares all drinks but by the time you get your food, the ice in your drink has melted since it has become warmed",0
"Employees are rude, service is terrible, took half an hour for me to get my meal. Supervisor was yelling at customers about putting trash in the bins. I asked for a cup of water and the girl said, ""we don't have water but I can give you ice"".......... Is ice what I asked for??? If you don't have water, how are you washing dishes? How are you washing your hands?",0
"If I could give less starts I would do so! Service is awful, waited for the order for 30 mins ( 2 cheeseburger and coffee) and finally got the food cold!!! Can you image it??? Management team must be fired and new staff should be well trained prior starting working.",0
incredibly long wait. cashier was stoned out of his mind wearing no mask and slurring his words and forgot half of our food. smiling creepily and saying random things,0
"At night, i퐒e been a very long queue to cashier. Too many strange people want to orders. services are very slow. many misunderstanding speak english conversation",0
When you want one of the main items on the list and they don't have it... sock juice is better than the service in this location.  How are these people even allowed to work here? Plants are nicer. I have been to McDonald's in 54 different countries and CONGRATULATIONS you are the WORST!,0
"The service was terrible, my order it wasnt complete and when we talk with the Manager he yell at us and touch our french fries with his dirty hands. Thanks to the cuban lady who change our fres. Don Come to this place, you ",0
"AVOID! The biggest disappointment about this restaurant is the total lack of service-mindedness of the staff. They got our order wrong, we ordered a dubble cheese burger and got a regular cheese burger instead and their solution was to take said burger and simply slap another patty in it before giving it back. They also forgot to include items in our order like sauces and such, and they couldn't give us a reciept after our purchase.

When my friend asked one staff member for the sauces he ordered she only spoke spanish to him, even though he made it clear that he didn't understand her. After some time and finally getting the sauces the staff laughed as he left.

At least the place was some what clean. Seriously avoid, there are a lot of better food places nearby.",0
"Place was not noticeable based on the Google maps direction, I ended up looking for a while for it because it is missing the iconic double arches people know. I was looking within the mall area because of the map description, and wished I was across the street as it would have been easier to see. When I entered to place an order, one of the cashier's had an upset look or scowling face towards most customers, and unfriendly look. I didn't like her look so I stepped to the next cashier and I ordered it was fast, I ordered a Happy Meal and was asked if this is for a boy or girl (assuming a toy choice here). I get the order, no toy! And asked all they said was ""no toy, sorry"". I left, I'm not surprised by the lower than usual reviews here. Also when eating my food I ordered triple cheese burger but got doubles instead, at least I was charged for double only.",0
"Slowest McDonald I퐒e ever experienced... completely disorganized. Plenty of employees around, just nobody seems to kno",0
I don't know where to start. OMG! This is the slowest MCDs restaurant in the world. Staff act like if they were on vacation. You can see in their faces that they hate working here and are just looking forward to the end of their shift. Manager came out after a while and there was no improvement in performance. The automated order system was not working so I waited in line for 10 mins. just to order and pay. From this point it was exactly 27 mins. until my order was ready. All that was was a bottle of water and a mocha coffee. And I had to ask them otherwise it would have been more than half hour. I reckon staff must really ask themselves whether they want to work here. There may be other better places where they could find job satisfaction. Here they're just turning a bunch of people into unhappy customers.,0
"Waited one hour for a 4 piece chicken nugget happy meal. Disorganized, unapologetic, and zero customer service. The kiosk machine for fast service was anything but that. They lost my order and the manager didn't want to step up to admit so.",0
If I couldn't give a star I would because the service over there is poorly I order a salad and they did not give me a fork so I asked for 4 for one. I was standing there for 3 minutes and then I asked her again for it and she told me no. Worst service ever.,0
"Absolutely the worst customer service I've experienced in my 46 years. I was in line waiting to order, mind you the line was so long you would have thought they were giving food away, and just as I get to the front of the line the cashier just walks away and says nothing.  I wait about 5 minutes and ask, is he returning to take orders, and was told no we only have one line now. The employees were rude, the lines were unbelievably long, and it took about 40 minutes to order and receive your food.#TheMcDonald'sfromHELL",0
"Slow service even on take out, didn't get everything I ordered and the food was below par. Go to subway just down the street.",0
Fantastic service! Came in around breakfast time and My wife was told that McDonald's doesn't have fries and continually asked if they would ever have fries and was told no fries! Legit this was better than the comedy show I saw in the cruise before stopping by here. Must see during yorr trip to Miami.,0
"The food is average here like all McDonald's nothing so bad like cold food or anything .the bad part about this location is that it somewhat seems to be a safe haven for bums and schizophrenic drug addicts. Everytime I have ever went here I am approached by someone asking for money or food , its ridiculous... it's like they all hide in there and come out to beg when a new customer enters. Last time I was there a bum with an injured leg was high on crack or something and scratching his open wound with the gauze removed.. completely disgusting, miami filthy .",0
Rudest employees I've seen anywhere I've been. Whomever is the manager and allows employees to act like this needs to be fired or maybe that's why they are stuck at McDonald's!!!,0
"I walked away from my table, and when I returned someone had drunk my coffee. Straight outta the cup...what a nerve.!!!! While the cleaning lady was right there..",0
"I would give zero stars if I could. I went in to use the restroom. I was told it was out of service. I told the young lady at the counter that I understood it was late and they don't usually allow ppl you use the restrooms after a certain time but I was having an emergency and knew no where else to go. I was willing to make a purchase in exchange. I pretty much just paid to use the restroom bc the food was old and very disgusting. I was shocked. There was a group ahead of me. Everytime they asked for something they were told it wasn't available and had to order things they didn't want. I was told I couldn't get a medium fry, I ""had"" to purchase a large. Like really?.. I'm grateful to the young lady for letting me use the restroom but it was also extremely gross. Who is running this place?",0
"Waited over an hour to get food, it wasn that busy. Turns out the people working there don speak English and were calling the numbers in Spanish. (The screen is broken). All we폻 ordered was a quarter pounder meal and a McFlurry. The fries wer",0
50 cents for a water. Screw that. Rude employees and slow service. Never had such a bad experience at a mcdonalds before. It takes 45 min to get an ice cream cone. They either need to get better employees or a bigger establishment.,0
"45 minutes waiting for a coffee... they serve me the wrong one... then the manager Marina came totally rude and aggresive to discuss that was what I ordered.  I show how wrong she was... but anyway she still rude and unprofessional.  Bad,  bad, bad... the worse place in South Beach.",0
"At this particular McDonald's ( Washington st. South Beach,Miami) The place is busy while the employees are moving around super slowly to get the orders prepared so the wait was a long for a McDonald's. Otherwise no complaints",0
HORRIBLE SERVICE! All employees look like they hate their jobs. Most with headphones taking to whoever on them. Cashier swearing at their coworkers and whoever they supposedly have on the phone. Claim they are not talking to the customers but the people in their phones. Took forever for just large fries and large sprite. dirty interior. No one is doing their job.,0
"Seriously, replace the entire staff or give them a training! We had to wait for about 45 minutes for our order, which was incomplete.

- wrong drinks
- cold food
- no sauces
- no napkins (alsno not available at the selfservice part)
- employees arguing with each other
- employees are juist having conversations with Friends who are at the desk.
- no structure in kitchen or frontdesk
- homeless people are sleeping inside the restaurant",0
Customer service sucks walk to counter to order my meal the Male cashier with 2inch painted fake finger nails was rude said something rude in spanish (i dont care to repeat) and walked away before i could place my order as if I wasn't good enough for him to take my order. However he did have time to come into the lobby and joke around with other Hispanic guests. I had to place my order with another cashier ( who was sufficient) My food was thrown into a bag and shoved at me by another crew member. All of the food was cold and the sweet tea tasted of coffee grounds. All of the tables were dirty and sticky. Having dined in and watched this gross misconduct happen to several guest. Having been a former Manager of a McDonald's it was a duty to share this experience with your company. To be honest if this store was in any other location it would go out of business for extremely horrible customer service and filthy establishment. If i had been a serect shopper or health inspector this location would have failed 占쐬%,0
"Great food,great location,entertaining rude employees and clothing is optional.Food works like a tasty laxative,you are sure to go within two hours.Cuban employee screams out the numbers in spanish while pregnant employee says Customer should turn gay because he is not picking Up  any of the female employees.Another employee has a nasty cold and was mixing a lemon with hot water.Another Customer was told by pregnant comedic employee  if he did not like their Service he should go eat on Ocean Drive.",0
I went there two times with bad experiences. Both time the automatic cashier was out of paper. You are calling assistance to have your number of order and they don care. They serve your coffee black even of you asked to add cream in the order. Looks,0
"Self-service order is chaotic. Only received 10 Nuggets instead of 20. Ordered sauces have been compeltely forgotten, now for the second time we had to remind them. Toilets were not clean.
However, food was as expected from McDonalds.",0
Not one person working spoke hardly any English inquired about Santa's Enchanted Forest coupons which was posted on the door no one could even answer me and said the didn't speak English. I said how you have a job in the United States and not even be able to speak English and they just laugh at me. It took at least 30 min to get a sweet tea this place is Seriously Screwed Up! I will Definitely be calling customer service about my issues at this McDonald's.,0
Food was good service was god awful. If you're selling hamburgers how can you have no ketchup or mayo packets. Waited forever oh and they have the napkin police you can have 2 napkins LOL. The only reason why I'm giving a second star is the food was good and hot.,0
"Server got my order wrong and made no effort to correct it. Said next and dismissed me very rudely. Tried to talk to another server who barely spoke English, and got the same service as the first. The order that I did get was not at all fresh. Overall worst McDonald's experience I've had. Not impressed and would not come back because of the rude workers.",0
"Visited  Sunday   17th  March 2019. Without any doubt  the worst McDonald's   I have ever visted. Yes it was busy but the staff dont respond. Stood around talking  whilst  massive queues of customers  built up. Absolutely  no interest  in customer service.

Food lukewarm so they obviously  not waiting for it to be cooked. No point sending it back to wait another 20 minutesNo one giving leadership. Ray Kroc will be turning in his grave. A disgrace if posssible 0 stars",0
Never experienced worst customer service in my life. I got charged for a 20 piece nugget (Which is what I ordered) but only got two boxes of 8. Then an employee gave me attitude and ignored me when asking for Sweet n Sour. NEVER COMING BACK.,0
"If you do anything today. Please tell each and everyone of the people that works here they suck. From the guy who can't answer the phone and correct an order to the manager that clearly has not one shred of managerial integrity. I'm sure someone here is worth saving, I just never came across them. #mcdontatall",0
"God, I swear, everytime I come here... what a disaster. The most incompetent employees. There's a thousand employees and service is super slow. Place is always packed and full of homeless people inside and outside the store. I don't even get food, usually I come in for a iced tea and have to wait 10 min+ never again!!!",0
"There are plenty of comments about poor service, not enough about poor quality of food. Not only did they mess up multiple orders, the chicken was undercooked and not eatable. Go eat somewhere else, this location won't meet even your lowest expectations of this brand.",0
"0 stars. It was 11 pm and I was trying to grab a quick snack after work. The cashier told me i couldn't order anything from the dollar menu. They were only serving large combo meals after 9 pm. They had medium cups but wouldnt allow customers to buy medium drinks. I didnt want to spend $9 on food that i didnt want.
I went to the 7-eleven down the street and bought pizza and a drink instead.",0
"Terrible experience to say the least! Workers didnt care & they were rude. Took 15 minutes literally to make a bacon,egg, & cheese biscuit. I would never go to this place unless you were starving and only had a couple bucks to your name!",0
"same as all the other reviews, slow, only 6 items on the menu, employees are on their phones more than their helping customers in front of them. Employee's also trash talk customers in front of other customers... Wasn't even worth the head ache of receiving sub-par food for.",0
"WORST MCDONALDS EVER! Considering is in a very important location in town: staff is rude, lack of service, lack of cleanliness. I퐉 EXTREMELY impressed of how the staff DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH. Zero! I speak spanish so I don",0
"This McDonald is an embarrassment to the well known franchise. I have never experienced such poor customer service from a fast food restaurant. I was making a delivery for postmates and the cashier refused to take the order saying that they didn sell small fries, mocha latte and that their ice cream machine was broken. I wondered why on earth are they open if they don have a",0
"THE DIDNT HAVE MY HONEY MUSTARD , SO THEY GAVE ME MUSTARD INSTEAD",0
"I had a security guy who works at this McDonald's ask me to leave as I was enjoying my egg McMuffin, coffee and reading.  The idiot said ""you've been here more than 30 minutes and need to leave"".  I told him to not be rude and to pound sand, he didn't like that.  Never in my life have I been treated like that or spoken to like that while sitting in any restaurant after paying let alone a crummy, disgusting and badly staffed McDonald's with rude employees.  To top it all off my order was messed up and so was this elderly mans order.  A disgrace of a McDonald's, should be shut down IMMEDIATELY!!!",0
They didn't give me what I ordered! I paid for 5 hamburgers and they only gave me 4 and the sauces were not the ones I ordered.... on top of that you don't get to refill your drink... I'd give 0 stars if I could! Avoid it,0
"This place is a filth. They don't bother cleaning the tables. The service is ridiculous and the employees are super rude. I don't recommend ever getting food here. I don't trust this place and I don't even trust sitting anywhere. And for anyone's sake, don't ever go to the restrooms. I'm surprise this place is still running and hasn't shut down. Gross!",0
"This is the worst MacDonald's I ever visited. I waited 30 mins for my order. While waiting I observed many other customers waiting and getting their orders wrong.  The staff that was giving out the orders, had difficulty sat the numbers in English. I understand we are in Miami, but come on now. The worst..",0
"Will never come back again, I퐉 from out of town, I waited 20 mins for some cookies and had to ASK for them. Then when I FINALLY got them she literally put the13 cookies in a to go bag, no tote, not wrapped up, literally just thrown in a to go bag AND they got my order wrong, gave me chocolate chip AND raisin, had me wait and 6 of ",0
"Disorganised, quite possibly the worst fast food restaurant I've been to ever. The staff who read out order numbers don't speak English, my own and many other customer orders were incorrect and staff had no interest in correcting them.

Whoever manages this branch should be ashamed of the shamblic lack of customer service here.",0
Do not come to this place. I come here expecting nothing and every time come out disappointed. You can always expect your drink to be watered down since they have them sitting pre-made. While waiting for my food i was forced to hear the obscenities that were screamed out back and forth between the employees. One employee even asked for a straw and a pregnant employee asked him if he wanted to be masturbated by her left or right hand. I퐉 not making this up. The employees there,0
"Very slow service.. One cashier with a twenty people line.. One lady leaning by the soda machine for over 15 minutes.  now 20.. You can order at the kiosk but you still got to get in line to pay..
Not organised at all",0
It aite! Just chang,0
"The food was cold we never got our drinks or ice creem the manager was so rude he thought u got u drinks after your food but we did not get our drinks at all even after waiting about a hour. This place sucks do not EVER go hear un less u like bad service and terrible food.
Hope they go out of business.",0
"This location needs to be shut down and reopen under new management. Everything is wrong at this place- the food is cold, dirty restrooms, your order isn being made until y",0
"No one speaks English here! And the employees don't like people who speak only English obviously. How is this place still in business. I tried the self-service order machine and there's no pager at all. The counter ended up giving me the wrong order and charged me twice the money over the machine.

Ahhh!",0
"Staff are incompetent and the place is chaos. No one knows where to go or stand.  All the empty tables were dirty. Food was rank as well. Go and enjoy the local food, like I should have.",0
"Filthiest McDonald's I've ever been to. We visited twice, at different times and it really is disgusting. Not surprising though since it's literally filled with homeless people, sleeping. It's like a shelter in here.
Police came in and kicked several out but not all of them.",0
Manager refused to refill my coffee. Overall restaurant team members are rude. I recommend going elsewhere. I think manager has poor customer service skills. Very disappointed at this location!,0
"Very bad service, too long to wait for your order. (15 minutes for 1 latte... really guys???) Almost no customers, but dirty tables and restroom which has no soup and hand dryer isn't working. Both of them. Shame!",0
"Always out of nearly everything regardless of the time of day, no value menu items are ever available past noon and good luck getting anything but fries after 7:00.",0
"Dirty, and bathroom was not clean.you need to be buzzed in to enter the bathroom, also, bad odor ( B.O) throughout the restaurant",0
Horrible experience ever!!! You have to wait at least one hour to get your food. Those stupid machine I order a happy meal for my son it charge me but it didn,0
"They were really short on staff, the orders took an eternity. This mcdonalds really needs a permanent security guard, the amount of people coming by on drugs making noise and disturbing are way to high. For the first time in my life i was afraid inside a mcdonalds. Not returning for sure.",0
"I would give it -5 if I could.
Total DISGRACE to McD brand.
We placed an order and paid at the self-serve kiosk. Receipt did not print out. Took our order # in vain hope of seeing the food. No such luck. You need to push yourself through the crowd at checkout counter to wait for order to come out. After 10+ minutes, we heard ""quatro"" screamed out by an employee.  That could have been our order, except it was missing few pieces, and none of the employees at food handout desk spoke any English to understand what I was telling them. NONE.  And my Spanish was not good enough to get the point t across either.
I went back in line, waited another 10mins to speak to a woman taking orders manually, who had to ask for an English speaking manager to troubleshoot our order.  Eventually, order was remedied, handout employee was instructed in Spanish how to fix our order, which she did, finally handing food to us with a farewell message of ""go cuno"".
You can lookup what that means, or avoid our mistake and NEVER go to this McD at all costs.",0
"The staff doesn't speak english. I used the kiosk and they were supposed to bring the food to our table, that didn't happen. My food was cold and stale, i complained and was ignored for 5 min mainly because they didn't speak english.... No Good!!! i would understand if the menu was in spanish but it's in english, don't you think that they people that aere serving you should understand the language the menu is in???",0
"This McDonalds serves as the poster child to why they should fully automated. The service is terrible. 9pm on a Saturday night and you'd think they've never served humans before. More employees standing around doing nothing while the line stretches to the back of the store.  Half the items in the menu aren't even available. One employee endlessly walks around the dinning area sweeping up nothing. Food arrives...french fries literary have no seasoning at all. I ask for salt, may as well be asking for solid gold.",0
This was the worst McDonald's I have ever been in the manager was incompetent and the people behind the counter were just as much of idiots as he was they actual tried to tell us that they gove the food and then give the drinks later McDonald's corporate needs to get involved im this location the manager and people behind the counter were yelling at people after people had to wait 30 mintues to get there drinks I finally gave up after 45 minutes I ask 4 times 4 my ice creams and drinks before I got 3 whole dollars back. and spoken to like I did not onow what I was talking about I have never been in a McDonald's that gives food first and drink later... Horrible service and horrible people that work there.,0
"Truly awful. Everything was broken down, many menu items weren't available. The nuggets that I did manage to get were overcooked--not quite briquets, but definitely crispier than I expect.

Probably the worst Micky-Ds I've been to.",0
"Very crowded, not organized,  bathrooms difficult to access and had no toilet paper in most stalls. Not very clean",0
"A Restaurant without a Restroom !? In the Pandemic !? And no Sanitizer? With  capacity of over 100 seats? In South beach  Miami? Possibly coz the profit is not good to pay a cleaner ?   You should say 'Mcdonalds & partners' coz the customers use the surrounding restaurants ""and streets"" to wash their hands or to pee. Still Unique, coz you cant find this in suburbans of Delhi, or Khartoum.  Shame....",0
"A true rip off! They automatically upgrade you for a large meal without asking you anything! I didn't realize right away. When I went back to the register, the girl said that's how it was if you don't specify you want a regular meal... Where else have you seen that??? She didn't apologize or offer me to refund the difference or anything... I asked to talk to a manager and she said she was the manager!!! Waow what a customer service! Anyway it's not for how much extra you pay it's just the fact that Mac Donald is a big corporation and shouldn't allow that kind of policy because the place is packed of tourists and staff take advantage of it. It's unbelievable to treat customer that way!",0
"Worst customer service ever employees are rude and not helpful at all,  I Sat an watched 2 employees sit in the dinning area and just chat for over 30 min while the restaurant was busy.  Tables were very dirty had to clean my own to use.  Don't ever eat here.",0
"Slow service and make sure they get your order right. Hint...Order from new kiosks. Buns outside asking for food, and if you dont help... they tend to get biligerant. Not cool, Mickey Ds. Manager knows, because I told them.",0
You know why this McDonalds is rated so low? It's because they have 6 ITEMS ON THE MENU EXCLUDING FRIES AND DRINKS! This place is trash! Had to wait 30 minutes in line just go get 2 quarter pounders and 2 fries! If you're in Miami I'm warning you do not go here! There's much better places in Miami to eat then this garbage.,0
One of the worst McDonald's I've been. The staff is so unhelpful and with really bad attitude. The ordering kiosks never works and usually one person taking orders for like 10-15 customers. Everytime I'm here always people walk out. And after waiting for 25 minutes to order they don't have most of the menu items available. Worst staff ever,0
"Worst McDonald on planet earth!! Sloppy service, dirty, limited selection on the menu. I believe mc Donald is losing millions with this place.
Once I ordered a double quarter pound and got a single. Once I ordered a single and got a double. One night I order a quarter pound but they had no more so I order a cheese burger and had no more I just left the place.
Also after a certain time they only serve large meals, no small nor medium.",0
"Service was absolutly shocking, I have been there twice now (Breakfast / Lunch) and I have been served but the same ignorant girl both times. Even though it is only fast food I still expect the service to out-shine everything else. She needs a lesson in hospitality, or go and find another job that is far away from dealing with a customer face to face.
The decor could do with up dating, but its surroundings with the style of Miami Beach being art deco / retro makes it fit in.
Food - Breakfast was great, quality was great, had to ask for sugar and was given 17 packets for some reason. Lunch was poor, no quality there, cold fries, and it was busy! So that makes no sence.

Overall - Poor. Wont be going back there in a rush!!",0
"Manager in the morning of April 26th at approximately 8am was the rudest I have ever seen, should not hold that position at all, ..",0
They won sell you anything that isnt $5+. You can,0
"MEH! To 10th power only good thing is they're quick. Service is subpar, there's never a hospitality smile towards the people they're serving. It feels like a grinder there, they must have a high employee hire rate there no one gives that extra effort for the guests, Thankfully there's a security guard working the dining area. I know it's Lincoln road and there's been a homeless and late night problem since forever, getting jacked for my fries will cause a huge problem.",0
"while I'm was ordering my food , there was a homeless lady waiting on her food . she came to the cashier and asked her"" where's my food ! I've been waiting for 25 minutes "" , u could tell that she was upset ( I would be upset too! ) . the manager Carlos ( he has to be the worst manager ever ) came to her and he said with a Nasty attitude "".... AND!?""   he gave her a nasty look and walked away . the homeless lady sounded that she had a speech problem . Carlos started saying  to the cashier stop taking orders from her !! never again ""!!... and then the homeless lady said , can I get my money back then?? , she got $5 dollars back.   carlos said as soon as she walked away he said ( with a nasty attitude ""she can have her money back I ain't the one sleeping in the street !! and she won't be eating haha..."") . can't believe he said that in front of customers.  !!  something else , the place was super nasty! we couldn't find a clean table ! and there was 2   homeless men sleeping inside of this  . I wish I could give this place -1.",0
"Worst Mc Donald's I have ever visited. None of self kiosk working, one registr open with slow worker, line of 30 guests, some items of menu run out, In stead of Fanta I got Ice tea, fries quite cold. A little bit filthy. 4 workers doing nothing and eating ice cream instead of serving customers. As a person working in hospitality business, I was really shocked, that manager and owner of the restaurant must see this, they are wasting a lot of money. Actually  this working habits are quite common everywhere in Miami.",0
"Ordered here from DoorDash about 5 minutes ago, they forgot one drink, our sauces, and an entire burger, probably the most my order has been screwed up, ever.",0
"this place is ridiculous, train your staff please",0
"Worst McDonalds in the USA! I would give this place a negative star if it was possible. There are a ton of homeless, creepy people hanging around outside and inside. The staff are totally clueless, rude and have no concept of customer service. I waited for 10 minutes on my double quarter with fries, when it came out, the fries were cold as could be. The cashier couldn't care less about my cold fries as she was busy flirting with some seedy looking guy who was hanging out around the counter. This restaurant would maybe be ok in the urban sprawl of Chicago or Baltimore, but I expected much more from one in South Beach. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",0
Worst experience ever!!!  Didn't have anything on the menu. When we finally found something we could actually get it was cold. The buns had been toasted long before the burger was made. Not even warm enough to melt the cheese!!  Never again!!,0
Something needs to be done about this McDonald's (granted i dont frequent any McDonald's) i just spent $8 on my breakfast and the only thing edible was the steak patty from my steak bagel...everyone there seemed to be tired too its 10am!!!...and how come no one speaks English there including the manager...is this miami south beach orrrrr??,0
"This place sucks! I'm never had oily greasy chicken nuggets before, they served that here. I got a grilled chicken sandwich but with no sauce. So I literally also had a large chicken nugget in a bun. Wait time is rediculois, waited 23 mins for 2 items and a drink. Worse macdonalds.",0
"Probably the worst McDonald's I've ever been to. Service was awful, there was a giant cluster of people grouped together waiting to order even though they have those kiosks to order (they were down). They didn't give us the correct food or fix it when we told them. Don't come here. Not even if you have a McDonald's crave. Don't do it.",0
Worst McDonald's ever so many staff doing nothing. Been here 3 times and all bad experiences. Food so long to be handed out it's cold that's if you get the right order. Tables filthy and never seemed to be wiped and toilets are disgusting.,0
This location is Very rude and impatient. This place needs to be shut down or replace the employees. Simple.  All of the female staff is RUDE ...,0
"was horrible workers barely speak English. at 11pm all of sudden made up late night menu only had select items ie quarter pounder big mac, fish fillet no kids meals fries but only large. fries were old. Hispanic manager barely wanted to do refund stalled on that. would give 0 stars if allowed",0
"Run by morons. We order 2 cones. They charge for 3 cones, so apparently 3 different couriers need to come to serve us. After 5 minutes of arguing amongst themselves and running to the back and telling us they퐇l get us the ice cream; a guy comes back to tell us that they won",0
Horrible. Place filthy.Service terrible. They fix ur drink early and 20 mins when u do get ur food its waterd down. Tables dirty and food on the floor. I asked them why its so dirty they responded that its the homeless people and tourist fault. Im like what.....,0
"Service was appalling, food took ages, dirty store and toilets. Incorrect orders and took 15 mins to rectify. Really creepy staff.
I expected it to be fast especially being on holiday from the UK but I was disappointed in my whole experience",0
"It was the most terrible Mc Donald I ever been!! The staff is completely all over the place.. they don even now what to do!
It is",0
WTH. 30 minutes and still waiting.  A terrible  location.  Skip it all cost. Bad management.  Bad food. No organization. Its a mess in here!,0
"Worst McDonald's i have ever been. The burguer was completely soaked in fried oil. It was so disgusting. On top of that, they took like 15 minutes to serve our order, and they gave us a paper bag instead of a tray when we ordered it for eating there. Avoid this place",0
Worst mcdonalds ever. They pretend they dont have anything on the menu and pretend they dont have any sizes other than large. South beach deserves a better  restaurant.,0
"Horrible service. If I ever have to. I will try to avoid going to that Mac Donald again.

Every time I go there they mess up my order.

Waited 30min to get my son an",0
The worst McDonald I,0
Just close it down. Worst service ever. It's a tourist based Mcdonalds so they know most customers are a one time customers. But I live in Miami Beach. I hate this place so much for lack of care and customer service. And they know corporate or management doesn't care. Makes me not want to go to any Mcdonalds anywhere at all.,0
Worst service ever if it totally disrespected being disabled I have to be served outside window and they said no we can't do that and they forced me to go inside I'm asking where or just here's money I'll meet you outside they need threaten to call the police,0
"Rude service, fries were underdone and cold, sweet tea was like pouring a bag of sugar down my throat. Unless there's an apocalypse and zombies are after you stay away from this place.",0
Terrible attention. It takes 20 minutes for the delivery of a burger. I don,0
"THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE DON'T  COME HERE AND HERES WHY.

1. Horrible costumer service.
2.The sprite taste water down and it taste like a knock of sparkling water.
3.My friend and I bought Oreo McFlurry taste like eggnogg.
4. The fries are cold
5.They don't give you napkins and ket
6.The Wrap-Cpy is soggy and if you want it crippsy too bad.
7. It's really dirty

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME COMING HERE!",0
"Racist!

The female with a foreign accent stated ""that's why we don't like black people"" after I demanded a receipt for my cash purchase of large fries. They would not accept any other form of payment!

Mean, nasty, and rude!",0
This is the nastiest Mc Donalds on the planet. It's not unusual to see multiple homeless people sleeping inside and the diner is always filthy. I'm not even going to mention the bathroom. If this is what the front of the restaurant looks like imagine what the kitchen is like. I would never eat here. I wish I could attach pictures on here so you all can see what I'm saying.,0
It was the worst experience I ever had in a fast food restaurants....1st off the lines go around the Mcdonals not because thiers alot of people but because thier are staff on thier phones and talking to each other while the lines r going around and around ....2nd after u wait sooooo long to order u get an attitude fir asking wby its taking so long ....it was 30 mins give me a break ur not cooking mostly everything is heated up its Mcdonals ....3rd they get ur meals wrong everytime no fail always!!! Iv come here alot of times but Im fed up ....the girl that worked thier rolled her eyes and laughed with another worker because I asked about y it was taking long ... comw on I dont mind waiting all day.

Something needs to be done this is not the 1st time and Im not the only one complaining!!! I never rate good or bad but today I cant take it .....I live in NY every place is packed and never ever the service I got here,0
"Spent 30 min in line, partly because order numbers were only announced in Spanish, got given a sprite instead of a McFlurry, coffee was medium instead of large because I퐉 guessing they couldn r",0
"Tried to Order on the Terminal - couldnt pay cause it said i need a table number but they were no signs for it. Nobody could tell me where i get a table number, cause nobody was able to speak english here. Not even the employes behind the counter could speak english - they acted like they were retarded. I couldnt place my order and had to leave cause nobody could understand me - Thought this is Amerika ? Worst McDonalds ever!",0
"How this McDonald's hasn't been shut DOWN is beyond me. This place needs more cashiers, security and a broom. An absolute otrosity. Many homeless people in the establishment. I have nothing against them. Shut this McDonald's down and open up a homeless shelter. The only reason I gave it one star is because I couldn't post this otherwise.",0
"The worst Mc Donald's ever!
Nobody understands English!
Uneducated , and rude employees , including the managers!
The Coca-Cola is flat! Like water with a bad taste!
Full of drunk , drug addicts, and homeless people",0
"Unable to use McDonald's app to purchase meal. Lack of communication when order is ready per order# leads to 20 min or indefinite wait times on 20 chicken nuggets.  No sauce with nuggets when asked to receive BBQ. No value menu and significantly overprices menues.  Let me finish by mentioning a non functioning hand dryier and no towels.  McDonald's Miami... ""I'm loving it.. "" NOT",0
Service horribly slow (more than 20 min to prepare a simple order outside rush hours). Unpleasant staff.,0
"Super crowded and dirty. They yelled out our order saying it's ready, but after looking in our bag it turns out we were missing half of the food we ordered. They need to get it together.",0
The food was good bit the service was awful! The cashier got an attitude because I asked if my order was right! Then on top of that the person handing out an order did the same thing because I asked for ketchup!,0
I required some hot water for my parents but they wanted to charge me for a tea. This could be no problem as a routine. Just make me somewhat uncomfortable.,0
This location sucks. Very disorganized & dirty. They are not cleaning tables. Filthy. Workers are not helpful at all. Bathroom is nasty too.,0
"Mc Donalds 1650 washington ave

This was a terrible experience with this gay guy, he is rude with customers and employees. I was standing for about 5 minutes in line, and i asked him why he is not taking my order, and he said:
I dont have 4 hands, i take orders after i finished serving all the orders. Im not gonna get a stroke.
Come one man! You are working in a Mc Donalds, you have to be fast and take orders while serving! That job is not for that guy. There are a lot of good workers out there who needs a job, and that guy dont appreciate that. I hear him saying to another employee: change your face because if you dont like it you can quit!

I would never go to that mc donalds! Never in my life! I never had such a bad experience with a gay! Those people are nice 100%! But this one has some problems!",0
"I have never seen so many RUDE employees here!!! The manager should be working at a flea market, no social skills!!!",0
"Worst mcdonalds ive ever been to in my entire life! The cashier entered the order wrong and made it look like our fault. We got supersized meals and we asked for sandwitches only.
The front workers did not know how to speak english ... Am I in the USA?! .. Pls
They did not have mac sauce.",0
The worst McDonald's known to man. I would rather traverse the dmz nude than visit this monument to inefficiency. Visiting after 10pm? Only 8 value meals are available. And chances they get your order right with the reduced menu? 0.  Literally 0 for 6 in the 10 months I've lived close to this location. Save your sanity and Walk the extra distance to Alton and 16th and visit that location.,0
"SCAM, when I went here a first time, the waiter Mauricio gave me a wrong change, I've said nothing. The second time I've returned with this same waiter and he gave me the wrong change again. I've said to him, he took my money and my ticket and he gave me less than before ! As I haven't my ticket anymore, I haven't anything to prove it... It's a shame !",0
Employees are very rude and they give you whatever they feel like giving you . I ordered 20 nuggets they gave me no sauce. I asked for sauce the cashier gave me attitude AND they were out of all of the sauce except BBQ. This is the worst McDonald's ever,0

"Dirty, crowded and loud.",0

The the drive thru is consistently much linstantly much lower than what's expected,0
"Don't waste your time at this McDonald's. You will be waiting for at least 30 minutes to get your food. Kiosk ordering is also messed up at this location, and doesn't work like it does at other locations.",0
"Worst place to go to, one of the worst McDonalds around, all staff is useless and they sit there and talk amongst themselves when they see that the line is out the door, always crowded, they're forever giving out flat ass soda, they had someone waiting 20 min for a drink, I ordered a simple 5 item meal and they took almost an hour to finally give it to me, food is cold most of the time, you're better off walking 5-10 min to the McDonalds on the other side of Lincoln and get your food within like the first 5 min",0
"The worst Mcdonald i ever been in. Stuff is slow, lots of misunderstanding, they don know what to do with mobile",0
"Very slow serving, I don't know if there was many new people in kitchen. But I had to mention what else they forgotten in my order in order to get it.",0
They took so long,0
Although the food is great there was not full menu available even on request.. i think that should be a legal requirement and really spoilt my trip.. very sad.. as i wanted to compare calories and price.,0
Really slow service. Crazy long lines at 7:30 in the morning. Expect paying customers to be out numbered by homeless...,0
"Asked for #1 combo . They charged me for the large . I went back to complain . Register guy said since I didn specify, than they automatically give u the largest combo possible. Nancy the ma",0
"Worst attention and food ever, don't worth the price at all. Waiters are very rude with customers. All the process was lingering and the food was really cold.",0
Took long time to get food. Food was cold.when ordering on do it you self screen after you order everything you could not pay then had to get in line to pay.AC was not working super hot inside.,0
"Poor service! I played order first, I got the last ! They gave me sausage McMuffin without egg even though I paid the price with egg! Really really bad service!!!",0
Ass. Buddy at the cashier told my friend and I that there wasn't 6 pc nuggets and we can only get 10 pc. And how there's no medium drinks when the medium cups are IN FRONT OF US.  Con artist,0
Everything dirty the whole restaurant. Was covered in trash n I was scared to eat my food but I was starving the staff isn't too friendly either they look like they wanna hope over the counter and start throwing hands at everybody,0
Only thing I liked was 24h running.,0
Rude and disorganized. 27 minutes to get coffee.,0
Worst McDonald's I've ever been to. Only half the menu items available (in large only). Terrible service. Rude staff  Got my order wrong and they gave me a hard time when I went to get the correct order,0

"I've waited 10 minutes before I could make my order with one person in front of me.. Thanks the told me that they haven't cheeseburger.
The service isn't polite and every single person stands around and is doing nothing",0
It use to be a good meal there. Now they sell only the expensive meals! You don't have more choices on the menu. I recommend subway is more cheaper and healthy it's on the same block where is mc Donalds.,0
Terrible customer service. Card machines didnt work on self service so people had to queue to pay despite placing an order which is just ridiculous. Staff were miserable. Barely said hello/hola,0
Order and pick up system. Horrible. The worst. If you just want a McFlurry or a quick coffee forget it. Go to another place. Waited nearly 10 minutes after an order for a mcflurry....,0
Very bad service,0
15minutes for a drink. Toilet worste than a war field. Everywhere dirty. No enough space. No receipt from the machine to order... Avoid this place!,0

It not good.     Staff - no customer service skills. I asked for milk for the coffee. They had no idea. Also no sugar was added and I asked for sugar. When I asked for a package of sugar I got lectured that I should have asked for it when orders.  It not good,0
Worst experience i,0

"Service is so so. The bad, some of the employees don't speak English. And while I was here, a confrontation between a black fat girl and an old bag on a wheelchair barking up a fight. Heard the old lady call the black a gorilla.",0
Slow service. At night time absolutly slow and no care if customer wish to order or pay. During day it is recomended to order and pay at self-serving kiosk.,0
"Not open 24 Hours.  Even the website says open 24 hours, but trying to navigate McDonald's website to contact them was impossible.",0
"Worst McDonalds iv ever been to!

25 minutes for 2 cheese burgers and 6 nuggets and ended up getting 2 quarter pounder meals with cold patoto chips and a flat Coke.

Can't keep up with demand, i suggest finding a different McDonald's.",0
"I would like to put less than one star bit I can't.
Worst Mc ever been, if u want to eat something fast go on and find other places.
Not recommended.",0
The service is horrible at in line for 30mins to be told the shake machine is down which always seem to be the story. They can only take cash and the customer service sucks. I really wish they get it together,0
"This McDonald's can never get it right. I've stopped counting the amount of times that they messed up my order, whether it's a slice of cheese missing or my sandwich overflowing with sauce when I specifically ask for a little bit.",0
McSorry AF location.Rude people. Your not doing people a favor by taking theire order. Your doing your job. Or you should be. What happened to Mcdonalds? They used to have standards,0
"TO FLEE. Waiters are very very unpleasant. I have ordered a Sundae, there isn't no peanuts and they haven't proposed me another thing to substitute it, like M&M's or Oreos or whatever else.",0
Really bad customer service. Not once but twice with two different employees. Asked for condiments and you would think they were doing me a favor.,0
The worst MD i have ever been to! The dirtiest restrooms and always veeeery long lines! And also they often give your order partly,0
Disappointed - wasted my time driving over here to find out that it's clearly NOT open 24 hours... JUST UPDATE YOUR HOURS ON GOOGLE ALREADY,0
This is the worst McDonald's on the planet not one of the rude Cubans that work there don't deserve to make a hamburger.,0
So I was offered a free fries and drink if I lend the cashier my phone. The manager used my phone to complete customer satisfaction survey on mac cop website.,0

I퐉 so disappointed bec,0

"Terrible service. They don't take the order properly and when the food comes out, is different from what I ordered. They don't even have mayo and it's a completely disaster.

Worse McDonald's ever.  Waited in line with no service for 40 minutes only to be told they didn't have hot chocolate...  Really....  And the servers were rude and unhelpful...  Avoid this place if you can...  Shame on McDonald's for letting this place represent them....,0

The food is good but the service and organization is a real mess.  Never go during rush hour.,0

QUALITY? Yeah right

SERVICE? They don't know what that means...

Hey somebody do something there, and remember HEALTHY DEPARTMENT IS AROUND THE CORNER!!!",0
The food was allright but the staff was very unfriendly. The need to learn how to greet people and smile.,0
"Literally the worst McDonald's experience I've ever had in my entire life. Staff move at snail's pace, let people cut the line, do not even acknowledge the wait",0
Kinda bad. Burger was cold and dry. Figure the way it was busy. It would be popping hot patties like crazy...but no :(,0
"I don't recomend  this place,  it's very dirty .

Horrible absolutely horrible service .. Food was good though,0
"Enter at your own risk, if you can make it pass the homeless hanging around outside.",0

"Slowest McDonalds! Fries often cold, coke taste like it has zero carbonation, restaurant never appears clean.",0
"They only serve big mac, mcchicken and chicken nuggets after 10pm. No drinks or other food than that.. Then just close the mcdonalds if you are not serving your food anyway...",0
I am very disappointed with this McDonald's.  I order my lunch 30 minutes ago and I'm still waiting inane for my to go order. I'm never going to this McDonald's again.,0
Ordered over the app. Came here while it was raining and they were closed.,0

You only speak Spanish made for a harbor experience I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone I understand where we are but they need to speak English as well,0
Horrible...Bad customer service...Dirty store with the men's bathroom broken,0
I overheard the man standing at the window outside because it wouldn't open the door for people to eat inside to say if the people out there,0
The place was very slow. Tables not cleaned. Recycled unused ketchup pouches instead of throwing away.,0
Pretty much every employee here is unhelpful and clearly unhappy. My order is wrong every time.,0
This location in Miami is horrible.  Ordered a Quarter Pounder and it came back twice under cooked. Not friendly at all.,0
"Worst McDonald's I've ever been to. Service is horrible and the food was worst. I don't recommend it, there's other fast food restaurants in the area.",0
By far the worst McDonald's I've ever been to.  Food was gross and the place is dirty.  Save yourself and don't come here.,0
Workers  very sloppy in serving  food to customers  they walking around  while the  food sit there getting COLD and act like  we are bothering them for serving  us  all these attitudes workers  need  to give up the job to someone   who have better  customer service representation.,0

"The service and food is horrible, u order take a number and wait for someone to bring your food the food never gets delivered, u have to get bk up and get it, there are flies all over the place, very unsanitary.",0
"Worst McDonald's in all of Florida!!! Staff barely speaks English and are sooo rude. NOT at all customer driven, very conceited, ignorant, and self absoluteness for the wait. Stay away at all costs!!!!",0
I personally don understand why is very bad,0
Absolute nightmare. Super congested. Slow to get order. Employees confused and seemed as if they didn,0
"Poor management, kiosks and monitors not working properly and place understaffed. Additional sauces missing and incorrect items delivered.",0
"I do believe that this place is without a doubt the worst McDonald's I have ever been in. Rude staff, dirty, inability to fill orders....endless",0
Half the kiosk machine's where down and crowd control was missing. Someone out front directing people and helping at the kiosks would have made a very different experience.,0
This is horrible place! worst service ever! shame of Mac Donald!Do not visit this place. Completely mess!!Staff was conducting in inappropriate way!,0

"Stay away! Beggars allowed to harass customers, area is filled with pickpockets, cashiers try to give less change and pocket the difference.",0
Two nights in a row we ordered from here and they forgot our sauces.,0
It is the worse mcdonals. It has a bad customers attention.. always the local is dirty and the food does not has the best quality.. It has to improve the service because of that place is in a tourist point!,0

At this location every employee have attitudes this is observing them with other customers. Horrible!!!,0

Very bad customer Service!!! Only one cashier open and she was very rude!! I did not Order,0

Ordered an apple pie at 2:03p and ate it at 2:30p only to relize it expired at 1:50p. It was hard and cold.,0

"Super bad wait time and service food, the fries were plain with no flavor also .",0
Horrible.,0
Poor service. Cleaners were literally sweeping around our table while we were eating ,0
Their food quality is nowhere near as good as BurgerFi's burgers & fries or FiveGuys.,0
"Order was wrong and waiting far too long for ""fast food"" on ly good thing was the milkshake",0
Dont have 24hrs on your door but your doors are closed and there are people inside. Change your hours!,0
The service was really bad we had to wait a very long time just to get fries and a milkshake and when they have gave us the order the fries were really bland,0
Sucked if i didnt have to give this bad place a star i wouldnt of i dont know how McDonald's keeps these people working 4 them,0

"crowded, dirty, frantic. fast service, but your order may not be correct",0
There is no free refill in this place . But u can use mobile app for cheaper order.,0
Congested location and interior. Employees always mess up orders - due to the fact that most do not speak English,0
Worst McDonald's on earth. Bathrooms are disgusting. Ordering is on kiosk but you never get your food. Pure chaos,0
So slow.  Took forever to even order and now is taking forever to get the food.,0
Waited 55 minutes for my order. No English. No change available. Rude and unfriendly staff. Avoid this place.,0
"Shocking service, staff didn't have a clue. Food was grim and the toilets were horrendous!",0
Filthy place. No paper on the order kiosks. Tables and floor very dirty.,0
Worse McDonald ever! We waited 45 minutes for cheese,0
Worst McDonald's ever... not even in Mexico you can fine attention like this. Disgusting.,0
It was cool for a quick bite to eat,0
"The food was bad and the staff were rude what more can I say, not the most pleasant of visits to McDonald's.",0
"Not clean place to eat always dirty, the area for the juice and soda always has a smell",0
Very poor- cleanliness was awful. Clearly no management focus on basic standards,0
"there food never taste fresh and there service is very poor.... This McDonald's ""suck""",0
We use uber eat order meals. The McDonald's missing some items and processing is very bad.,0
"Horrible restaurant, dirty, have no options, all the time just few combos available, should get out the the business",0
Very Bad service and NO CHESEEBURGER AT ALL!!  Worst McDonalds experience Ever!,0
They disregard promotion offers and very arrogance stuff and unfriendly boss. Very bad commercial for mcdonalds brands.,0
"If I can give zero Stars I would, I went in in front of the very beginning she didn't want to take my code for the app, then they literally gave me just the buns that were burnt and burnt chicken and when I asked for my money back they didn't want to give me the rest just the burger and I said that's fine but I need my fries and she threw my fries away in front of me and literally said that there was nothing there. So basically they're pathological liars and like to take advantage of others. I also believe they're all family members working there",0
"worst macdonalds i have been to .

normaly i don leave a review because it macdonalds. it most of the time good but i퐉 traveling as a teen for almost a year and come to the macdonalds almost daily and never seen a place this dirty and so non customer friendly .

"I use the drive through and I order 2 meals. No politeness from any of the 2 people inside. I asked for barbecue sauce, the girl throw one at me (and she really throws it) and then told me that if I want more its 25 cents for every barbecue sauce I want. Yall should go to the other Macdonald on misson bay, they are sweet and respectful and dont ask you to pay for barbecue sauce, Its free over there. Dont lose your time and money with those people, it just does not worth it.
Service: She throw sauce at me
Atmosphere: No politeness
Food: have to pay to get barbecue sauce lol

I haven been to a McDonald in years but the prices are way up. $27 for a small breakfast fo,0
"This is not a 24 hour establishment.
They allow you to place an order via the app and then, you show up to pick up your coffee and they come to the window just to tell you they are closed and to dispute the charge with the app. Poor service and false business hours advertising!",0
"This was the worst place that I have ever been to McDonald's is a joke. I remember when this place actually care about what they make, and since when did they take the pickles off the Hamburger",0
Rip off pricing. I seen this first mc Donald try to charge 3 dollar for plain biscuit and they said they don't have egg biscuit key person try to rip off people by saying it depend on owner how they charge. Is this Mc Donald? They might have to change name Rip off Donald,0
"They used to take EBT here, and now they don't.  If they got the EBT machine back in there, I'd probably bump the review up to 3 stars, but they also got my order wrong today, and I've seen them treat local transients pretty poorly.  Even one guy who said he offered to buy a homeless man food without being prompted and stated that the staff kicked the homeless guy out because they thought he asked the man for the food and he said that he left and refuses to go back.",0
This is the only McDonald franchise that charges CHOCOLATE MILK that is supposed to be included in the happy meal! Their manager told me that they only give SODA! When did kids start to drink soda?,0
"Two stars just for the brand, but let me be real here, the staff needs training in this location. Customer service not good! Every time when I go there is a long wait, I'm talking about waiting over 20 minutes or more to get your order, and the bad thing is there is not a lot of customers to have this long wait. Maybe they are always cooking everything from scratch ? I almost forgot to mention the funny part, one day I was a hurry and could not stop my scooter, so I went to the drive through and the lady told me on the speaker ""mamm please come inside, we do not serve people on scooters on drive through !! I was so upset and could not find a place to lock my scooter and I gave up on the whole mac thing, I just go there because my daughter likes to eat Md.!   You can also find some homeless and  junkies from the beach gathering inside to use restrooms.  Maybe just because is the beach area I suppose !",0
"Noise and dirty place.
BIP BIP BIP constantly.
The cookers also clean the toilets.
The Sistem twice a month doesn't work.
Long time for order meal.",0
They don't take ebt there I was staving hungry at that time they were not so kind it was hard to walk from beach,0
"If you like waiting an hour for your food, this is the spot for you",0
Probably the worst McDonald's in the area. The crew is always slow. The service is never fast. The restrooms and dining are are sometimes dirty but that's because of the customers. Thank goodness they have kiosks to order food. I recommend ordering through the mobile app if possible. They're always busy. They'd get more stars if they improved their service first.,0
"Terrible at the night. Staff is unfriendly and sometimes rude, when after 40 minutes of waiting, I asked where my order was, a guy named Gustavo just turned away and left.  They say that they have a lot of orders and few people.  Firstly, at least two people there only did what they went back and forth, but they could help other employees to speed up the process.  But my god, why should the service suffer from this?  Hire more people for the weekend.  Or did you not guess that people come to you on Saturday night? Supervisors need to conduct trainings for staff, otherwise they forgot how to communicate with customers and how the company makes money.  And in the end, where is your smile?  Or are the good old days of smiling gone?",0
"Cold, stale, busy saturday night. Would love to get that 20 bucks back.",0
absolute s*** hole can't even get an iced coffee right. severely uneducated and highly overpaid,0
The drive through is a joke at night. They really got only 1 person working,0
BEWARE!!! Roaches! Calling health department. This place will be closed down. Handed my food and a roach was on the bag. I jump out walk in place is filthy. Night shift girl refused to refund. Owner contact me. I watched as your staff be disrespectful to others. Giving food out for free to groups of Mexican kids. Garbage everywhere inside and out. I am on vacation this week nothing but time will be making phone calls all week. Wrong person people.,0
"If I could give this McDonald's Negative stars i would. Worst McDonald's ever, Really Bad Customer service, very dirty, and Homeless people sleeping inside on booths then sketchy people around,  The older Lady in the front taking orders was Very Rude and unfriendly. Will Never come back to this place.",0
Long waits. I guess is not a drive thru anymore. Faster service if you walk inside,0
"Seriously, this McDonald's is the WORST I've ever seen! Advertise themselves as being 24/7, but are always closed when I go at night. The staff is rude, and I'm always waiting for what seems like forever (usually 20+ minutes). The worst part about this place is that they consistently screw up EVERY order. Hell, half my order will be missing (like it was just now), and they'll flat out REFUSE to fix it.",0
Food is poor...service is bad...long wait for food,0
"Unbelievable that everyone else has the same complaint as me...they never get the order right.

Tonight, I realized that they forgot an item after coming home with food for the family. I first tried to call just to get reimbursed...but no one answered the phone.

Then I decided to drive back for a refund while the rest of my food went cold on my dining room table. When I got to the drive thru, I politely asked for a refund for the item they forgot.

Having worked in the food industry myself in the past, the service was awful. For the sheer inconvenience, they should have refunded me and at least offered the missing item to me free of charge. However, all that was given was a refund...not even an apology to go along with it.

Terrible service along with the terrible cold food that I then had to go eat at home (thanks to my having to drive back for a refund).

Mistakes can happen but not as often as they happen here. Do yourselves a favor and avoid this location!!!",0
Twice I ordered iced coffee from this location. Both times the iced coffee tasted horrible. That my last time going to that place. They really need to get t,0
"Location a bit of an inconvenience, service could have been better. Cashier was slow, did not ring up my order  correctly, had on gloves and was touching his hat, money, pulled his phone out of his pocket several times and was handling food.... this is not sanitary! Not happy at the fact that we waited for 15 minutes for 3 large fries as we watched the drive thru serve 8 other orders before ours, and we were the only customers inside at the time.... Having worked for mcdonalds in the past, I know for a FACT it takes just a little over 2 minutes to fry a full basket of fries (which leads 3 large fries). And if they had 3 baskets down at once (which they did) then there should be no reason to have had us wait for so long. Will not return to this location!",0
"I've been here many times, usually after midnight as I work late. Recently, the majority of the times I've gone through the drive through they say that they're closed, but when I ask what their hours are they say ""oh we're just closed for an hour""- this has happened to me at 2am last night, 4am last week, etc.

My issue is with the restaurant claiming to be open 24h even though it definitely isn't.",0
"This is the most disorganized Mc Donalds I have been to in my life. They are the slowest, most unprofessional and disrespectful one that I have ever seen. I live at the corner, so I did not have a single experience. It was multiple ones, and it is always the same terrible service. Once I had to wait 30 minutes for a simple and 'should be quick' coffee. But the last time I went there was the worst. I stayed around 20 minutes in the counter and nobody was capable to ask me if was in need of something. I was picking an order up, which took me almost 1 hour (20 minutes until somebody talked to me + 30 minutes waiting for the food). They are just always so messy that from now on every time I want to eat a burger, I consider first going to Wendy's or Jack in the Box, or another Mc Donalds store... not this one anymore",0
"Lobby closed early and would not take our order in the drive through even though we were paying customers, clearly displaying their classism as we did not have a car. Encouraged two inebriated individuals in front of us to come back with in car (recommended getting a DUI).",0
Slowest fast food ever,0
"Had to buy a coffee to ask for the bathroom only to be told ""it's closed. We're only open for take out"" even though I walked into the restaurant. No amount of pleading would make the cashier budge on what to me was urgent. The standard answer of the age for any garbage policy today is ""Covid"".",0
"I've never had so many orders be wrong in my life. I just tested 5 different orders over 5 days, all didn't times if day, yes I get board easily, and not a single one was right. Not little stuff like napkins, but like burgers, fries, and drinks missing. Yesterday it was a mc flurry. Before asking for it directly, I even asked (knowing they forgot it) ""am I missing anything"" and got a ""nope, you're good, have a nice day"" well, at least it was with a smile...",0
They lie saying they are closed to not prepare your order,0
"Good place, and good location. But staff needs training. Some workers are very very slow, and you can tell that they are not familiar with the menu and point of sale machines. It took them 15 minutes to make my caramel macchiato. Hopefully it will improve over time.",0
"Generally you know what you're getting when you go to a McDonald's drive thru, but not at this location! Burgers were messy and not stacked properly, fries were almost inedible - soggy and barely room temp. Hard pass, go somewhere else.",0
"This place is a total wreck most of the time. This is an extremely busy location and I've been going here for years as a customer and also as a delivery driver and it's astonishing that pandemic or not, they still have the same issues. They are never prepared to maintain the volume of business. You often have to repeat yourself multiple times when communicating with the staff. If you go at night (particularly late-night) there's likely to be a long line in drive-thru or inside. They regularly claim their ""system is down"" and so are unable to accommodate you. It's completely upsurd. I don't understand how any establishment can think that this mode of operation is acceptable. Other than that, typical McDonald's.",0
"Been to this location 5 times now and have NEVER had a good experience. The first two times I waited 30 minutes with only a couple of cars in front of me the first time and NONE in front of me the 2nd. The first time was so bad that the whole line of cars were honking and going over the curbs to get out of line. These people take FOREVER and are rude as hell. Not sure if they need new management or a whole new workforce but this place is AWFUL.

Customer service is horrible. Food is disgusting and I love McDonald's but this one ain't it.,0
I퐒e lived next to this McDonald for over 10 years and never go in because of the overwhelming number of vagrants in and around the building.  I have two kids now and they of course like McDonald.  They recently renovated it so I was optimistic and took them in there for breakfast.  Right away there was a bum outside the door yelling to himself and when we walked in there was another one lying on the ground next to the tables.  I went back a month later for happy meals and the kids wanted to eat there.  All the tables and floors were dirty and they still had bums outside and in.  While we were waiting for the food a homeless guy wanted to use the bathroom but there was a lock on it. When he asked a worker they said it was for customers only and the homeless guy started  only a block from my house.,0
"I have traveled all across the world..I have eaten at McDonald's in the UK, Japan, Mexico and across America. The McDonald's at 1121 Garnet Ave in Pacific Beach has to be the very worst Mcdonald's ever! This reflects on the managers and poorly trained staff. The staff is very rude and incompetent. I now travel to the other Mcdonald's on 4711 Mission Bay Dr. The staff are polite, well trained and food is always hot fresh and up to Mcdonald's standard quality.",0
I mean it's McDonald's right? You know what to expect from the food which is both a plus and a minus. However at this particular McDonald's right on Garnet in Pacific Beach they are undergoing Construction. It seems like a complete redo the outside and some of the guest areas as well. It's a mess and noisy but does not look like any RI modeling of the kitchen area is being done. That makes me wonder why this has become the worst drive-through around even before the construction. Two cars in front of me still waited almost 10 minutes. Isn't that a lot from McDonald's? Or foremost drive-thrus these days it seems to be way too much time. Now I'm not just saying this because of today's visit this is been the case at this McDonald's now for the past couple of months. Maybe it's short-handed help but that would only be an excuse for once in awhile. Anyway not a great experience but probably should be eating elsewhere anyway.,0
Physically waited in line for a hour while the drive thru and uber eats received seniority. Most had already walked away after placing an order with random folks taking what they can get unchecked as the attendants stopped caring after the first 10 minutes. Please close this location as it is no longer viable,0
I went for an ice cream cone and it's always sketchy. A lot of times they don't have ice cream. This time they were cleaning the machine in the middle of the day. That's just stupid. No ice cream cones or milkshakes or any other ice cream products McDonald's is known for this though. Not just this one. I don't eat their food because most of it sucks.,0
Horrible absolutely Horrible! Never will I eat at this mcdonalds! I live in North County and I never had horrible service like I did today. Very slow staff... Angry managers! Very understaffed. They messed up a lot of orders back to back. There was a lot of people waiting for their order. They messed up my order twice and it took them forever to replace my order. There is homeless people here panhandling. Management is absolutely awful! They would never let a place like this run in North County... I expected more from this place. Worst experience ever. The staff had horrible attitudes. 10 min later I got diahrrea.... idk what they put in my food but definitely not coming back.,0
"Worst McDonald I have ever been too. The service is long AF, 10 minutes to have our order taken and it was a nightmare because the cashier didn understand anything. 20 minutes later we got our food thrown in ",0
I wanted to use the app to redeem a free kids meal with a kids meal purchase. I asked if they take coupons from the app and the woman said no. Then I asked why not and she said she didn't know. I should have asked for a manager but I didn't. When I went to pick up my order I did ask the manager and he said they do take the coupons from the app. I told him the cashier said they didn't so I was not able to use my coupon. The manager looked at her like he was annoyed and told her she should have asked if she didn't know. Then they talked in spanish and started laughing with each other.,0
"Didn't take very long to get food, but the person taking my order didn't speak a single word of English so she had to ask for help for everything I said. She was being trained at the same time but couldn't even talk to me. I understand Spanish is needed sometimes especially in Southern California, but when it's busy and you're the only one working the register and the main language is English, what are you going to do. What's really going to happen is you're going to restrict what your customers are able to order. I order the same thing every time I decide to come to McDonalds so I have no complaints about the food, but this time it compelled me to write a review. Was an uncomfortable situation today.",0
"As always the service is slow,  its a busy spot, i get it. Today the # s were way past mine, now i have to stand in line, because i was told just a minute several times to find out about my order....now i just want my money back not hungry anymore. The Sup. Did fix the problem though i dont know what was said. ( i still only speak our official language) 36 minutes later out the door with an "" i appolagize""

update: Avoid this place! Didn't think it possible it could get slower, dirtier or more Dangerous. WOW.
My Bad.      ",0
"Almost didn't even get to order half our or cuz they told us to pull up to the second window before my bf got to order what he wanted. We asked for sweet & sour, only got BBQ & Ranch. We didn't get straws. And the fries we got we're stale. When we tried to call back to try & get a refund it went to a fax machine. Wasn't even busy at the time.",0
"Even though they renovated this place a few months ago, the homeless still call this place home. I cant ever sit inside without hearing screaming or seeing someone passed out on the floor outside. And the last few times i had to inquire about my order because they forgot about it. If anything, go through drive thru",0
"Staff were arguing amongst themselves whether who does what. Managers were indifferent to employees and with customers. Ordered two Happy Meals and a McFlurry and about 6 customers after I ordered, received their orders before me. We waited around 20 minutes or more. The McFlurry was supposed to be the Stroopwafel and there was hardly any in it, it was 99% vanilla ice cream.",0
"This location is horrible. I ordered at the kiosk and I got a locator for my table, that clearly stated that I can, ""sit down and relax"" and the food will be taken to me. That did not happen. They were yelling my number over and over and even made eye contact with me and clearly saw the locator on my table and still didn't bring me my food. When I asked why I was given a locator for my table, the manager simply responded, ""We don't do that here."" Workers were not polite at all. The women's bathroom had no toilet paper. I had to wipe with a toilet seat cover!",0
"This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. We have stopped a few times and the greeting I get is always, ""what do you want"" I say hello, thankyou, and have a good day at the window and they basically throw my food at me. Sadly, the only nice person, has told me, "" sorry for the wait, we don't have enough workers.""",0
"Gross.  Trash overflowing.  Really bad. McDonald's Corp should refund my money.  Pay bathrooms were a nice touch.  Obviously, there is a problem with the homeless.  Here is a solution...HIRE the homeless... This McDonald's needs all the help it can get!",0
"It is a very clean and recently revamped McDonald's but beware taking your kids here, as outside is, well a cockroach infested wonderland full of PB's finest citizens. That's all this Review gets. Use the drive through you wouldn't want to catch Hep.-C on your way to wash your hands!!!",0
"Workers very nice but when we ordered at window, as we drove off it was changed from Big Macs to quarter pounders.  I said something when I paid and he corrected it.... got to window and he handed me the bag, they were quarter pounders.  Just took a long time and everything was wrong.",0
Hands down the worst McDonald I퐒e ever been to. The staff,0
"I've been going to this McDonalds since 1995 when I was a kid.  The service here is horrible    I ordered a hot tea at the drive thru and the kid at the window was extremely rude.   He opened the window and said ""its $1.83.""  When I asked for an extra cup and some honey he rolled his eyes as if I was asking for way to much.
I know its McDonalds and you cant expect exceptional service but dont make it so obvious that you're being rude on purpose.",0
"Slowest McDonald I have ever been to. On a Friday morning just around 12:30 am, there was 5 cars in front of me. It took them over  30 minutes to get to me. This is unbelievable, I h",0
How is it possible for a McDonalds to be this bad!!  I have lived in PB for almost 20 years and this location has NEVER gotten an order right. Truly unbelievable,0
"Manager on duty Ignacio extremely hostile and rude. I am an Uber driver and I have visited this location two weekends in a row. It is a very busy location on Saturday evenings. On my first visit I went to the drive-thru and ordered $10 worth of food and then parked and ran inside to ask to use the restroom he told me I had to pay a quarter. I then explain to him that I just had come through the drive-thru and I was a customer he said oh well.. you have to pay a quarter. On my second visit one week later I walked in ordered a coffee and politely asked him for a token for the restroom, Ignacio appeared to become upset by my request so much so, that he actually tossed it at me hard enough for it to bounce off the counter and land on the floor. He did not apologize...he just walked off.I feel he should be reprimanded for his blatant disrespect and rude Behavior towards paying customers. If this location is too much for him to handle maybe he should transfer somewhere else. I will never return to this McDonald's again as long as the manager Ignacio is in charge.",0
Quarter Pounder was actually missing the meat patty. French fries tasted like they were cooked last week. Still took 15 minutes in the drive through with only one other car.,0
"Chips were not hot and staff seemed too busy to talk when I tried to get condiments. There was a few customers but the bag was basically thrown at you and then you were never looked at again.

Edit: I've since been back and my friend had to wait 10minutes for a Coke. They then tried to claim they'd called it (when they had clearly forgotten about it as it was sitting on the drinks machine with no lid). Not sure what the management of the place is like but they'd want to change something. Staff are awful and rude.",0
stuck in the drive thru over 25 minutes (cars in front and behind us) and they had no drinks available. put a huge damper on the vacation. employees were clearly irritated and rude. by far the worst McDonald's experience ever.,0
"Absolutely garbage, was rushed while placing the order then the girl at the window was talking with someone for 10 minutes who cut in line at the drive through and they didn even order anything!!! without a mask on whi",0
"McDonald's generally sucks out loud. This one is even worse. I don't think the drive thru has ever gotten an order correct. They're constantly running out of staple items i.e. they don't have fries at the ready or the shake machine is busted. If that's not bad enough, it's a hang out for the local homeless. And not decent homeless...the methed out violent type.",0
"They messed up our order on two different occasions in the drive thru. I do appreciate the enthusiasm they have, I also just want my order right.",0
"Disgusting there was a customer who walked up to the counter and said his big mac was cold. The manager traded the burger with another and put the one the customer brought BACK in the hot warmer to resell. An employee asked her if she should throw it away the manager told her no, it's ok. GROSS",0
The staff charged for the wrong meal and never offered to reimburse the difference.  One of my kids asked for yogurt she gave apple.  One of the drinks was supposed to be lemonade she gave sprite.  The bun was hard and stale tasting on my sandwich.  My entire food was cold.,0
"I ordered to go nothing was right in my order
Cold fries cold food no sauce with the nuggets!!!!!",0
"Food slow and inaccurate often. A lot of homeless/riff-raff hanging out front. Inside and Outside seating. Low food quality. Okay for a late night snack, but not good for Monday morning rush hour.",0
Scarry ace to be too many homeless hanging outside didn't feel safe,0
"Terrible quality food, my smoothie tasted like pure coconut oil, the iced coffee was poorly made, and they constantly forgot the condiments. At least the hash browns were good.",0
"Being this particular McDonald's is close to the beach, one should come?to expect that service would be more efficient. Not this one. Ray Kroc would be rolling in his grave if he saw this.The cheese on my  sausage McMuffin seems plastic also wait, Luke warm coffee, & attitude to go with it! There seems to be lots of friction between them and some some of the clients that come in there namely the homeless . Not all but some of the staff  was extremely rude to them refusing them service and treating them subhuman. Shame on the manager, .I have been raised on Mc D",0

"Well, I퐒e been here a lot of times but this is the last time. The service is bad, the wait time is not even close to be fast food standards (",0
"Worst service ever at a McDonald's.
People waiting to order and the manager and crew wouldn't even look at us or tell us to wait. After ordering I had to ask for my food, they just left it there on top of the fryer.",0
"Like others have said, l get home with my order and someone doesn't get to eat because they shorted my order. Quality control doesn't exist at this place.",0
Its basically a 24 hour homeless shelter that serves food & takes food stamp ebt card. Usually several parking spots are congregations of homeless and their gear. Its always like this as McDonald's allows it. Not the safest place. If you must use the drive thru only.,0
VERY Rude gentleman that works at McDonald's.  Shorted me of my food 2 times in a row. Very bad attitude!!!,0
"While using kiosk, it made many selections for me I did not choose. Had to delete many things from order, got frustrated and just put it in. It was too busy at the counter for the personnel to answer my question, she informed me there were customers in front of me. Being hungry and tired, this was more frustrating than it should have been",0
Very slow service beside expected business during the late night. I would not recommend if you would like to get your food quickly during late night weekends. It is as if they do not prepare for the late night rush.,0
"Definitely the worst McDonald's I have been to in over a decade. Not just slow, but yelling at customers, arguing with everyone, people waiting everywhere, sounding like utensils dropping in the kitchen, etc.",0
Not open 24 hours -_- they said they close from 2 am - 6 am even the drive-thru but they will serve people ordering on food delivery apps? Didn't make much sense to me when they are supposed to be open 24 hours and still make food for delivery orders,0
"Poor hygiene, no hand sanitizer, no toilet paper, dirty tables. The kiosk didn",0
Every Time I퐉 here it takes about 15 minutes to get through the drive thru. It do,0
The Wor st Mc Donalds I have ever visited! They hate Americans and make jokes about customers in mexican (not Spanish) to each other behind the counter ... Dont eat here. There are many great Mc Donald's close by who treat you with respect. Starbucks coffee is close by and a better value too.,0
"Repeated my order 3 times, at the drive thru speaker, then again when I paid. They still got it wrong and sent me to the waiting area. How hard is it to get a #1 without onions and pickles?",0
Ordered mcchicken got 2 McDonald's. Lady couldn't speak English or understand what I wanted. Couldn't read my order back. Sweet tea was ,0
Unfortunately I can put zero stars but if I c,0
It's Mc Donald's what do you expect? But it took three times to get a half cut tea. And someone I was with once got a Happy meal there and they forgot to put the hamburger in. So....,0
"My posts are going to start showing a lot of a "" one man protest"" for a while. I will continue these actions until I receive an apology from this story or until I get some backing..
This McDonald's restaurant continues to mistreat the poor and destitute.
1) requiring some to take their food to go
2) some they charge for a restroom token even after they paid for food and or drink
3) 30 minute time limit for the ones they choose to alow to eat in ONLY ENFORCED FOR THE POOR.
4) will not ask ""for here or to go""",0
"Horrible! They ignored us completely .. Just standing there for like 15 minutes and even asked the lady if they where open , she only turned and nodded. Bad bad service.rude! No people skills at all.",0
Placed all three meals on Doordash and they messed up my meal and they won refund my money nor my meal. They gave my dad and mine meal and ,0
The worse mcdonalds in America and absolutely heart breaking the way they treat homeless people. All Hispanic crew so you would think being immigrants fighting Trump they would be more sympathetic,0
If I could give it zero stars I would waited an hour for my meal in the drive-through,0
Waiting time is way to long!!! Had to wait for about 30 minutes for my food. Thats not what i expect from this fast food chain!!,0
The fries were cold and hard the only bright spot was the drink,0
"Please be sure to check your order before leaving!!! Took them 3 times to get the order fixed, and I had only ordered 3 regular meals ",0
"This place sucks, horrible customer service and restaurant not available all the time!!",0
Bad customer  service,0
They had only one person workig the counter last night about 7:30. She wouldn't take a order until the one she was working on was filled.  It took for ever.,0
This place is horrible do not ever ever eat at this location. It took 20 minutes for 2 ice coffee's and the managers never even acknowlege that we were waiting.,0
This location wasn't even packed when I pulled into the drive thru. They forgot my fries and didn't put in barbeque sauce . The food wasn't even warm after it was handed to me.,0
The people that work here are very rude. I am super polite to them and they are still rude,0
Torally F****d up and very horrible place. ordered something and got something else horrible. very bad service and the cleanliness is worst. The worst McDonalds I've visited till date.,0
"It was in the middle of being renovated, but the and food was worse than usual. I would recommend staying away until renovations are done, and then give them a chance.",0
THERE IS A MANAGER THERE CALLED GABRIEL WHO HERASES THE CUSTOMERS TO NO END. I FINALLY SAID SOMETHING. THE NEXT TIME I WENT THROUGH THE DRIVE THOUGH SHE LOOKED AT ME. HER CHEEKS WERE RED WITH A SMERK ON HER FACE. WHEN I REACHED MY DESTINATION. I FOUND GABRIEL TOOK A BITE OUT OF MY TRIPLE CHEESE BURGER. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. WHAT A LOW LIFE. I'M DONE WITH MCDONALD'S. THAT WAS THE LAST STRAW. THERE ARE SO MANY BETTER PLACES TO BUY A HAMBURGER. IN PACIFIC BEACH ON GARNET.,0
Probably one of the slowest mc donalds in US,0
Staff attitude is poor. They won't let my son to use their bathroom although we made a purchase there.,0
"This may possibly be the worst McDonald's in San Diego. They are slow as all hell, mess up orders on the regular and are generally just hard to deal with. Avoid this one AT ALL COSTS",0
I asked for fresh fries and nuggets. They were not fresh and I did not receive any sauce. This place is terrible.,0
"I wouldn't let my kid near the place, I'm not even comfortable going there an I'm 6'2 guy --they need to leave there sprinklers on AND close the patio after dark, to clear out the beggers",0
Worst McDonald's experience I've ever had.  They were so slow I wanted to bolt out the drive thru,0
My experience of is this specific McDonalds according to Customer Service and Cleanliness of the restaurant tends to be on the lower tier of fast food restaurants around San Diego..,0
Every time I go into this mcdonalds my fries are cold and going through the drive thru they get my order wrong.  I will not visit this one ever again.,0
"Service is slow, full of homeless people, its been 15 min for my food and im the only car is this specific mcdonalds thats like that",0
They are always late. Serve cold food. The afternoon shift people are the worst. Unprofessional and rude.,0

Employees were joking around talking bad about customers in spanish (customers were non spanish speakers) and orders were taking a long time to get served.,0
Lots of homeless people in the restaurant.  Made it uncomfortable.  The employees were awesome though and great service.,0

Food was slow. Manager (short hair woman) was having a mental breakdown or something and was being rude. She needs to be fired. Her name was Elizabeth or something. Very unprofessional.,0
"I came there to pick up order around 5 in the morning, there was a manager(brown hair) who dealt with me very rudely, i politely requested for my uber pick up but he showed me attitude and just shut the window. That was an awful experience for me and i would like to suggest them to show some etiquettes and respect towards their customers. I also work in a restaurant and know how to deal with the customers and uber orders.",0
Obviously not enough  staff working.  Ice machine was broke.  We had to go up to counter and ask for a couple things missing from our order.  Things were a mess.,0
Probably the worst McDonald's restaurant I know. They can't manage to get any orders right and I've sat in their drive thru on several occasions for a few minutes with nobody covering it. Terrible,0
Awful service. I'd starve before I eat at this location again. Person working the cash had no idea what they were doing. Others standing around not doing anything. Door was locked in the middle of the afternoon so people couldn't come into the lobby to order. No ice available for your drink. Do yourself a favour and find another location to eat at.,0
"Doors say they open at 6am. Thats a lie!! At 630 still locked. Nobody answering the phone, constant busy signal. **management?if youre not going to open the doors for din",0
"Extremely slow when I passed yesterday around noon. Order came without any napkins.. Dispenser beside soft drink fountain was empty. Ask for some napkins at the counter and got 1 ( one ).
How cheap can you get??
Garbage cans beside the entrance were overflowing.
Can not recommended at all.",0
Haven't seen a McDonald's so lost in my life :(,0
"Very slow. We were one of two cars, we were asked to go to the third window where we waited... while the car behind us got their food, then another car. Our order? One mcdouble. One double quarter pounder meal. That's it. Then the fries are cold. If they had competition in champlain they would not be doing well.",0
Waiting over 30 minutes to order. Then get to the window got my food then it was wrong went in doors were lock only 730 at night all doors were lock. All was 4 cheese burgers. Went back to drive thru window cuz my order was wrong. All they did was scrap it off only wanted pickles and Mac sauce and it was everything on it. When took it back just scrap off and gave it back. Was nasty,0
"The worst drive threw service. After waiting 10 min to order because 2 cars used the left lane drive threw and got served before me, then having to wait another 20 min to receive my order, to see that the McChicken had sauce when I said no sauce and the cheeseburger wasn well done like I asked. If I could give 0 stars I would. A week before 25 min drive threw wait and the food was co",0
Incredibly slow wait.  Food served was cold.  Received partial refund and PERSONAL INSULTS from the crew.  You do not need to train such bad staff.  Fire them.,0
This one,0
Franchise owners need to hire more staff to keep up with demand,0
The owner of this McDonald's needs to read this.  When you have a breakfast special  you should want to please the customer. If the customer wants 2 sausage biscuits instead of 2 bacon biscuits  are a customer would prefer a a certain type of bread for there breafast sandwich special you should not put stipulations on what type of bread they want.  Other McDonald's have catered to my needs if your not willing to cater to customer needs then you will have less customers.  Also charging for ranch not everyone can eat ketchup because of acid and stomach problems and need ranch for there fries instead of ketchup. Anyone that says they need ranch for there fries are hashbrown not just chicken nuggets because they have stomach issues you should make exception to that for that.  And one last thing.  Your workers look miserable not one of them smiles at me im very outgoing person.  You need to explain to your workers that there attitudes are sour and need to cheer up. We all have bad days but when somone looks like they hate being there based off of there unfriendly customer service then they need more training.   Night service is better from my experience but the morning service needs to be looked at.  It's not fun to drive up and the worker gives you that look like they hate you and shows no customer service skills at all. Thank you for your understanding. Take my advice and you will have more customers,0
"Coming from Montreal, this is our first stop after clearing US customer. We stopped for breakfast around 930. They did not have the egg steak and cheese bagel. In fact, they had no bagels at all. We ordered the muffing egg meals but got the biscuit meal. It also took them a while to get our order.",0
Ordered two Mcdoubles...one with ketchup only the other plain. The one with ketchup was so messy you couldn't even handle it and the other wasn't plain. The order was printed correctly on the receipt. Are these employees just not able to read?,0
Food seems to be getting worse. Tables dirty. Sketchy crowd loitering within the store.,0
Only stop here if you have to.,0
Stopped here at the Champlain location for a quick bite while on my way home. The service was extremely slow. The employee tasked with serving the food to customers walked out and took several minutes to return and upon return took several more minutes to serve the food. The food was subpar as well. My recommendation is to avoid,0
"The french fries were stale.

Edit: dropped one more star, it was noon only car in drive through ordered a double cheeseburger and fries. Got to the window from there they sent me to there 3rd window  where i sat for 10mins until i got my food. The fries were half full and stale. The cheeseburger was good though.",0
A complete joke I told them I wanted a medium meal they charged me for a large and when I asked it to be fixed they said ok and didn't fix it . I will never go there again .then when I asked for ranch I was told they didn't have any but my girlfriend went in and asked for it up front and they gave it to her . I would of gave 0 if possible .,0
Went for the coffee which was fine. But also ordered a breakfast sandwich and a hash brown. They had an excessive amount of grease. Couldn't finish it.,0
"We grabbed dinner Sunday evening, 2 x 2 cheese burger meals and 1 chicken nugget happy meal. We jumped back on the road to head home to peru after a hockey game. We opened our yellow cheese burger wrappers to find all 4 cheese burgers were missing the cheese. What a disappointment after a long day and drive.",0
"Worst coffee drink in my whole life, literally threw up in the parking lot & threw it away after 1 sip. I don't plan on coming here again.",0
Give the wrong burger  i asked  for double qpounder  and drive half mile and find I didn't get right sandwiches. And drive delivery parts couldn't turn around after I kind when out my way to get a bit to eat. But hop they put right one in the box the next time.,0
"Always double-check your order when you get it. Be patient. So many irate customers here. It's unreal. If you come during a busy time, use the self-serve kisoks. I have never seen them open more than one register since the remodel. All of the excellent staff were let go when they rebuilt the store and didn't come back. This particular store is the best argument for a $20 minimum wage. Maybe if people earned more they might be more motivated or they could hire people who are enthusiastic.",0
"We are frequent customers of this restaurant.  While the food was good, the inside was a mess!  Every garbage can was overflowing, with stacks of garbage piled up on all of them.  The tables were littered with paper and garbage. There were papers all over the floor, even by the register.  At the drink station, there were scattered cups and catsup splattered on the counter and floor.  Counter service was excruciatingly slow.  Since we really like the renovation and usually great service, we will probably give it one more shot.  We were there almost a half hour and so no one in the front cleaning.  Hopefully they can address and correct the problem.",0
"On the rare occasion my family stops here the order ALWAYS gets screwed up. More often than not it's the drive thru that screws up. The kiosk is cool and the game on a table is fun, but that in no way makes up for the lack of attention to orders. My rare visits will become even more rare.",0
In a rush to get a lunch after 7 hours of work and the cashier takes an employee before me even  though I was next in line. No biggie until the employee orders something so messed up the cashier has to ask someone how to punch it in and then needs help again to give the employee the discount. I've never had a good experience at this McDonald's.,0
The service was okay today and the staff was friendly. I still had to pull up to wait for someone to bring out a simple order. This location is routinely slow in processing drive thru orders.  I'm talking 15 minutes or more. I wouldn't order anything there within an hour of closing. I was once served an Egg McMuffin on a biscuit with a folded egg. Some friends ordered 10 McFlurries and each cup was less than half full like they rationed it out.  This is probably one of the most disappointing and poorly run locations. You don't mind paying twice as much for a coffee at the Dunkin next door because the McDonald's is sooooo slow.,0
"Poor service, it took over 40 minutes for our food. The workers were more concerned with the drive thru. Nobody was working the front register or paying attention.",0
"Wow... This McDonald's is beyond awful. So many bad experiences!

For one, outside the place smells like a landfill. The inside is covered in flies and old decorations from months ago. Every table is dirty, the bathrooms are atrocious and the garbage is overflowing. If that were tolerable, the food certainly is it. There's always something wrong with the order or the food is old and stale or overcooked. We have had multiple issues with their soft drinks machine. Either the soda is warm, there is no carbonation or both. If someone suggests I go to this McDonald's again, I'll kindly tell them I'll eat my own foot after trouncing around in manure. There's no reason that cheap food has to be so lacking in quality.",0
"Horrible manager there , a woman by the name of Marsha I believe  or start with  an M i. I v Been waiting for the food for 15 mins and she tells me if I don't want to wait I should leave . How can a manager tells this? I am sure there is some sort of conduct policy or else she wouldn't been a manager",0
It was horrible order from inside and it was a 27 min wait for food!! Ridiculous for 3 meals....,0
Since their new building has opened it takes FOREVER to get your food! It supposed to be fast food and it takes 20-30 minutes in the drive through and then they gave my kids toddler toys when I did not ask ,0
"Worst service in years. 10pm at night. Only car in the drive thru. 20 minutes for chicken tenders and fries. No explanation given. ""We are working on it"". The team's teenage friends inside however were getting personalized service with their coffees.",0
This place has the worst service they kept giving us the wrong order and actually had his pay for someone else's. the area took a while to correct and then we still had to wait for our food for another 10 minutes or so. This was all done through the drive-thru and I expected better service the New York City from this place but I definitely didn't get it. the food actually wasn't that good either I remember feeling sick after I got home later so I definitely don't recommend going to this McDonald's.,0
"No one waits on you EVERYONE wants to help you order from the buy here pay here kiosk.  I want to order my food pay cash and have someone there so I don't have to wait 10 minutes for someone who has ignored the fact I have stood there 10 min, to show up and say May I help you. Ya you could have been here 10 minutes ago instead of standing in the corner with EVERYONE else running your mouth",0
"These people can't get an order straight to save their lives. We went in with an order that was WRITTEN DOWN CLEARLY and was very precise. 3 times we had to go back to the counter. The last time my sand which was dropped on the floor, picked up, wiped off, put in the container and handed to me! I got the entire incident captured on my phone and when I confronted the person, they denied my sandwhich even fell. This place is all around terrible. Save yourself the risk of salmonella poisoning and drive the 18 miles to Plattsburgh. Your health will thank you! I'd give zero stars if it were possible!!!!!!

.... 2/17/19....
Here We freaking go again! Tried one last time tonight, was very specific with our order (which wasn't very hard to begin with) and guess what? A complete and total failure! These people just don't Care! Do yourself A favor and drive the extra miles to Plattsburgh.",0
"This place seriously needs some funding from the head office to renovate and modernize the dinning area. Washrooms are deplorable. Considering the amount of Canadian traffic that passes through Champlain, I believe most would like a pit stop for lunch while traveling down to the states, a renovation would be warranted and I think most people would enjoy eating here more often.",0
During a severe thunderstorm I told my son to pull over and get indoors. He was right near Mcdonalds in Champlain and he went in and ordered some food. After he got his food they kicked my son out and said he couldn't hang around due to covid right in the middle of the worst part of the storm. Use some common sense Mcdonalds and have a heart.,0
They took the fast out of fast food today! Always pull ahead at window 2. I remember when you use get your food from that window! If the machine breaks down we break down!,0
Place was over crowded. Took 10 minutes to place order then another 20 minutes getting it just to not get my full order. I won't be back to this resturant.,0
"Long wait drive thru 30 cars customer inside waiting over 20 minutes to get his order taken, poor service",0
"Extremely slow service, almost 30 minutes to get two cups of coffee, all staff was servicing drive thru and took the inside customers orders, but did not fill them. Not even a""sorry for the delay"". Manager told staff to stop taking orders",0
"Was asked to leave because the dining room was closed,
however there are no signs stating that the dining room was closed. This was after we ordered on the kiosk in the lobby that said nothing about the dining room being close as well. The food was poorly prepared it was a mess.",0
They force you to order from a kiosk while employees just stand around.  In fact the busiest person there was the one telling people to use the kiosks to order.  I had to ask three times for my drink cup.,0
"Lacking in customer service.  Wouldn't substitute steak for sausage in big breakfast. Even after we said we would pay extra. Biscuits were hard. Bathroom was nasty!
Only good thing worth the one star was the coffee!!",0
Tired of getting cold half filled frys! They would not serve half a tea! Why serve half a fry!,0
This is the worst McDonald's ever.they are very slow.they screw up our order every time we go there.we are done with this place.today I asked for 2 hamburgers I got 2 cheeseburgers.wth.we are always asking for our cup for our soda.at times we could stand there for more than 10 min.before being waited on.never again.,0
Was ok food usually gets messed up and sometimes not so tasty at this McDonald's I used to go their all the time when I first moved up here but every single time I went their messed my order up and the food was mostly gross some is ok but not as good as other McDonald's,0
They don't listen. They gave us really cold fry's. The Dr. Pepper was flat. The manger was very rude. I ask for light lettuce and extra sauce on my big mac. And they put big load of lettuce and very little sauce. THEY DONT LISTEN!!!!!,0
"Absolutely awful, get your stuff together McDonalds. Yes, their food tastes good but the place it's self is horrid. If you are in a rush which most of us are since it's fast food, don't come to this one. Without a doubt they will get your order completely wrong. They have literally messed up my order 3 times in this past week. I order iced peppermint coffee, and they never give it to me even though it says it on my receipt, it';s always hot coffee they give me. One of the orders messed up my coffee so bad that it was just a hot coffee with just creamer in it, no sugar or flavor(even though I asked for iced peppermint mocha). I ordered 2 pies and they didn't even give me them, plus picante sauce comes with the breakfast burritos yet they never give me it either. Mess up my McChicken just about every time I order it. This happens very often but this time it threw me over the edge since it was so frequent this week. Champlain's McDonalds is the worse by far that I have been to.",0
Was going through and the family decided we should get McDonald's seeing how we were about 30minutes till they closed was gonna just get something small went to the drive thru and no one answered pulled to the front and saw about 5 people just looking at us weird then turning to each other and laughing.. not satisfied with them at all,0
What staff they had were working hard but the place was a mess in service was very slow.,0
Slow service. Kids working don,0
"Normally decent food for a McDonald restaurant however if you order a frozen drink, they make it first so it sits there and melts. No matter what time of day, it always the same. Don",0
"Terrible service and terrible management. Paid with 2 gift cards and 10 dollars cash for my meal, you would think I would get change back, but she hands me back a gift card. Tells me the change is on the card. Gave me back an empty gift card, tried using it in plattsburgh on rt9 McDonald's, manager informed me it was empty....So I guess thievery as well goes with their reputation",0
"The McDonald's in Champlain NY is a great place to grab something to eat and to be honest I just came here last night on my way to Altona to play the slot machines and I really enjoy coming to this McDonald's and it's way far better than the one is in my town where I live and it's like Night And Day compared to this one and I just as well give this place a 5 Star Rating and the other one is a 1 Star Rating and if I had the opportunity to give it a BIG FAT ZERO I REALLY WOULD AND I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S FAIR TO REVIEWER'S TO HAVE TO GIVE IT A 1 STAR WHEN THEY DON'T DESERVE IT?????

This McDonald's here in Swanton VT is probably the worst place to get so called fast food! I go through the drive thru too order my food, but before I do go too McDonald's I always make sure that I have a full tank of gas in my car. Because by the time I get my food, I've already waisted at least 15 bucks in gas by the time I leave this place. I believe that if it's going too take a half hour or more to finally get my very Luke Warm Garbage then this McDonald's should not be allowed to call themselves a part of the Fast Food Chain! If you want to get something quick to eat, then don't go to this McDonald's here in Swanton and their service is terrible and the food is even worse!",0
Only been there once before today I remember why it horrible had to wait for my food for them to not even give it all to me ,0
Not big the food,0
No milkshake no change for your order not told this till they are collecting my money I'm not in to being hustled by McDonald's good luck I won't be back very disappointed,0
There was a bug in my filet sandwich but the manager rectified it by giving me a coupon for a free filet fish meal .I'm suppose to get another one in the mail I haven't received it as yet .,0
I dont want to use a computer to place my own orders. I order a sandwich without things that come on it and special drinks. But then the cashier can't get my order right either,0
I'm parked at Maplefields store. I walked up to McDonalds. I ordered a bacon sandwich. Instead I get a deluxe qtr cheese. This always happens. This is why I go to Wendy's.,0
"Food was cold. Asked for no pickles, got pickles. Fries were stale and we waited 10 minutes for the food. Why was it cold if we had to wait? Only reason we stopped was there was no where else to go.",0
"They seem to be indefinitely out of bacon. Last week, no bacon in my double cheese burger although I asked for it and today, they replaced it with ham in my BACON McMuffin...

Edit: after weeks of ordering there, they always do mistakes on every other order!",0
"I stand almost 10 mns in front of a cashier Who completely ignore me. When I requested to be served, she looked at me and Says: I'm sorry, I didn't see you.
No surprise. I am a black man 6 feets 2 and 260 lbs.",0
"Just went there after it opened after over a month of building a new restaurant. This place has been known for getting orders wrong all the time, first time going there in a while, got my order wrong..... Puts a bad taste in my mouth, literally",0
"There is always long wait at drive through, sometimes even for 15-20 minutes",0
"Not very fast, not very clean, not very good. The opposite of what could be a good fast-food restaurant. On the plus side, they have high chair for kids.",0
"Ordered 40 dollars worth of food drove 15 miles home to find my grandson didn't get his chicken MC- nuggetsthen drove back 15 miles back for the nuggets gas + time because of their mistake
And I get an apple pie, wip- pe do thanks alot Champlain MC Donands!!!!!",0
"The food was good. Hot and fresh. But every time I go, the wait is inexcusably long.",0
Latte machine has been out for 10 Days . The coffee never taste the same !,0
Possibly the worst and slowest fast food experience I have ever had. The only thing that was good about this restaurant is that it was clean.,0
"Been here multiple times, and had to wait over an hour and a half the first time half hour this time. Called and emailed the first time with no answer and this time was told I dont pick my team or do schedule.",0
Couldn't eat there as they don't have Halal menu,0
1/2 hour waiting for two egg McMuffins. Bathroom gross.,0
"Meal was late, fries cold and I had to enter from the drive through to get my soft drink that was not brought out to the car.",0
Ordered a chicken sandwich only to get home to find out I got a burger and since I was the only car in the drive through  not sure how that mistake could happen,0
The worst service I ever experienced at a McDonald restraunt in champlain ny very slow and have no clue whats going on they need someone to manage that place and speed up the service,0
I will never return to this location. We went in there today and they did not wait on a truck driver. he left without food and was very angry. Truck drivers should be served they are the ones out there working for the country,0
Very nice staff but took 20 mins to get egg McMuffin. Not worth it if you're in a rush,0
"Poor service, cold product nothing was good about my last visit",0
"Service was slow, no napkins anywhere.. I watched an employee put his hands in his pants and then continued to work without washing his hands. Then touches an ice cream cone... ew.",0
Bathroom was disgusting! Major need of updating broken tiles not clean at all when i went in on may 15th 2016,0
Always having to wait more the 10 to 15 mins in the drive thru.,0
Using the drive thru ? Check your orders !,0
"Consistently terrible and slow service/quality. They also don't stay open during the hours they list, closing early.",0
7 out of 10 times I go there through the drive through they forget something and I have to go back inside and get it,0
I ordered a coke and got a dr.pepper. this is the 2nd time that they have done this.,0
"Worse food ever, way to salty. Had to throw it away. Definitely not the McDonald's of years ago.",0
Terrible curbside service.  Not busy and everyone had to wait at least 20 minutes for a small order,0
GET RID OF THE COMPUTERIZED FOUNTAIN DRINK MACHINE!!!,0
Their food is excellent by day but mess up orders at night it seems like the best time to eat is in the morning,0
It was the worst service I've ever seen it took 45 minutes to get our food chicken nuggets Egg McMuffin and two drinks,0
"Very busy place, you wait for your food. The place is a mess and the staff is hardly personal.",0
"Was not at all impressed. Very rude!!! Clean establishment, how ever needs much improvement on customer service!!!",0
I had to wait 25 minutes for a breakfast sandwich service very slow there and most of the food I've gotten from there since then has been cold,0
"Just awful....remember when Mcd's was good food quality? I actually do....now, they really do suck!",0
Cold fries and burgers wrong order sandwiches put together very sloppy really needs to step up with their customer service ..,0

"Been coming to this Mc Donald's every time I'm in the area never had a bad experience till today, I ordered a double quarter pounder with cheese meal, by far the Greasiest Burger I've ever had in my life nasty.",0
Everytime I order from here something is always wrong. I ordered uber eats today and my fries are half gone the sauces I ordered for my nuggets not in my bag. The fries are always an issue.,0
"Ive gone to this location several times. And today was by far the most unpleasant visit I've had. It was just the absolute worst! I'm taking my Son to work and decide to stop and get him lunch, and as soon as I'm ordering through  the intercom , I can already tell the demeanor of the worker was comming off pretty rude.  Once. We approached the window , when I gave her my code for my McDonald's Rewards she right away got even more rude with her whole body and facial expressions and didn't want to take my code , but in a very bad mood overall. Her attitude was so unpleasant. Being a McDonald's customer for years, I Didn't appreciate her behavior , she just ruined my whole mood and day. Her manager came to explain to me the situation in a much calmer , respectful manner. I mean, thats all Griselda had to do. Employees like this need to get trained better on how to properly interact with customers. Once you're clocked in, you're clocked in and should be ready to go. Trust me. I know. I've worked in customer service for 18 years. So I hope this McDonald's location properly trains Griselda accordingly.",0
My burgers were made sloppy and the service was slow..,0
I would  Give this McDonald's 0 stars if I could they don't only forget your sauces for your nuggets but they give you a Burger with a paper still on the Patty cooked with cheese on it. I bit into my Burger and I chewed it right away I tasted the paper.. Took my Burger apart and found the paper that's on the Burger Patty before it's cooked . Be more careful. People could get sick if they eat that.  It would be nice if I could get my money back for this.,0
"This location is horrible, 1, they assume you speak Spanish.
2, they made me pay e yea because they don know ",0
"They almost always get my order right. Not today though. Ordered McMuffins and got this instead.

Update: still getting orders wrong. Dropped it to one star because the homeless people hanging out asking for money is getting out of hand. One guy started blocking you as you exit the drive thru to ask for change.",0
"I'd give it a ZERO if I could. From the time I pulled in until the time I was handed I drink through the first window, I waited 22 minutes. I finally got so frustrated because nothing that I honked my horn to get their attention. When they realize that all I had was a drink she handed it to me through the first window and I drove around the people that were still waiting. It was a horrible experience! This is definitely not a place to go if you're looking for fast food. I could have done better with a local diner.
On top of that it was the worst tasting sweet tea I had ever tasted. There was hardly any ice so it was warm, it was mostly water and the flavor was like a mixture of regular tea and watered down sweet tea.
I can honestly say this is the worst McDonald's I have ever driven through.

"On 10/04/2022, at approximately 12:55 p.m., i ordered my food through the mobile order app. I entered curbside 5. After 15 minutes of no food being delivered, I walked into the store. I spoke to a manager and she told me my food was outside. I went outside, my food was no where. I went back into the store, i asked one of the curbside deliverers if I could please have my food as my lunch break was about to expire and I was going to be late. She stated she would check on my order. However, she had time to walk out with another gentleman that works at the Mcdonalds, walk outside, and give a good bye kiss. When I finally received my order 25 minutes later (1:15 p.m.), the bread on the big mac was soggy and my fries were now stale. Last to say, I ended up throwing away half of my big mac and all of my fries. This store needs a lot of help from corporate. A few weeks ago i bought 4 deluxe breakfast's over the weekend for the family and they gave me no syrup. Luckily I had syrup at home. Anyway, it'll be the last time I ever purchase anything at this store. I should have gone to jack in the box across the street.",0
They usually forget things like ketchup or sauces but today they ran out of fries. This was suppose to be large...,0
"Food ios great, but the drive thru linesn are insane.",0
"We placed  our order at 4:37pm, by the time we made it to pay for our order it was 5:07pm. They take their sweet time with accepting paying and giving the customer their orders. To make matters  worse our order was incorrect.  So we had to wait another 5min to get our order correct. Once we got our order our burger was EXTREMELY  sloppy! Careless job. If your employees  don't feel like working send them home. Theirs  no need to have lazy workers. Last time we come to this location!.......",0
"Slow service, speaker wasn't working to order.  Plus the happy meal didn't have an option between boy or girl. I have two boys and we got a girl toy.",0
"Been coming to this McDonald a very long time, seen a lot of employees come and go, and the changes in the structure of the building itself. It was bad back in the day, but this crew is hands down the worst. Super slow service, and most do not know how to talk to customers. (This is to Management, your employees are pla",0
Horrible service. young cashier had addittude. Didn't want to give me the stuff I needed the cashier was in a bad mood. When I was eating my fries I noticed a fry was really black and dirty like it had fell on the floor and they picked it back up. Nasty.,0
"I just wanted iced tea and a mocha frappe. They were just what I needed. The service was seriously lacking how ever, the drive thru person was rude and seemed to not be able to understand my simple order although we were both speaking English and it seemed to be the only language that they spoke.",0
I spent more time waiting for my food than what it took me to eat it. 28min,0
"Grand children and i pulled through drive-thru  and no one opened the pay window drove forward  like any other establishment two the payload window where I was  disrespectfully addressed. B.... made Manager come to the window and say, "" we pay at the first window around here"" and I'm like... if them lazy mofu back there get on their job, I would haven't  missed the opening. I'm business, just 'poor' management on that wing of town. I'm business,  Check your employees before you try and check the customer. And get nothing twisted I handled it better than I ever did in life.",0
"Worse customer service for dinning area, they ignore you and take 5x as long as the drive thru even if yiu order on the app.....Avoid pick up or dine in......",0
"Management is terrible. They let one person handle the front counter ALONE.
Employees must hate working here and drive through is always packed. Takes an hour to get your food.",0
"I asked for my order to be prepared fresh & hot and it was the opposite the fries were hard and cold. McDonald's shouldn't serve fries unless there fresh & hot. Why do we have to request our food to be fresh, it should just be fresh off the press. These fast food places kills me and there getting worse.
Their customer service skills are poor, they have language barriers. I need to protest against these fast food joints.",0

Worst Mcdonalds I've ever been to. They take forever and horrible customer service.,0
"There were items on the menu they did not have, they  only 3 costumers in the lobby and it still took almost 30 mins. The people ordered before came back twice because items were left out the bag and/or order was wrong.My food was cold but I couldn't stay any longer. This is not the first time I had a bad experience at this location, I feel they need a new manager that can take care of business w/ employees, costumer service, and overall cleanliness. Lastly the young  lady that waited on me/us was very sweet and apologetic.
Thanks",0
"Cold fries, the order was wrong n missing items .",0
They didn't want to give me sauce for my nuggets and they didn't give me all my food and I live to far to go back I called and they wouldn't answer it's a lot of high school children in there the person at the drive thru never made eye contact with me he was on his phone the whole time I was paying for my food and the guy that walked up stomach was hanging out from under his shirt I gave one star but they don't deserve any,0
The mgr guess doesnt want to work. Told me that they dont open till 8am. Web and door show 7am. Going to jack across the street just got out the hospital haven't eaten since 9am yesterday.,0
"This place is literally the worst mcdonalds I've had the unfortunate pleasure of eating from. They forget to add items into your bag and when you go back to tell them they apologize but do nothing about it, making your wait even longer. If I owned this mcdonalds I would definitely clean house and get somewhat competent workers.",0
"What a horrible experience I had today, I came to order the spicy chicken nuggets  and also ordered a coffee with cream. The lady asked if I wanted the hot sauce for the spicy chicken nuggets and I said yeah  but, I never got the spicy sauce! My coffee had no cream in it, and it didn have any of those small packages of cream ",0
Pulled in drive thru at 1 50 am closing at 2 they left us there until closing time and didn't even come say they were closed. Such Aholes. We drove past all the employees sitting in the dining area chilling. Disrespectful as you know what! The ghetto shines at this dump,0
"I hate to leave any fast-food spot a 1 star, dont feel right but when they finally get my order right at the screen, pull up to the first window, order still wrong we finally get it right and repeats it back to me, as I pulled up to second window, order was wrong and put the blame on me. Was over it at this point. Was only trying to buy 2 cokes and 3 McDoubles, no special requests.",0
"Usually the lane in this location is crazy long but we thought we got lucky today because the lane was short. We placed our order and drove to the window to pay. We waited for about 3 minutes to be acknowledged. A young lady with a yellow shirt possibly a manager was facing her back to the window and she talked to the cashier. It took for me to honk in order for her to open the window to take my payment. Not once did she say anything to us. Not a greet nor an apology. Just took my credit card and gave me my receipt. I drove to the next window where another young girl was. She gave me my food and I asked her if the lady in the yellow shirt was a manager and she said yes. I then asked her for her name and she has the nerve to say "" I actually don't know her name I just got back but I'll ask"". What??? How do you not know who the manager on duty is. I left. The service was extremely poor for no reason at all. I ordered 2 happy meals and a nd chicken. I think that's an easy order. Horrible service. The manager did not look happy. As a matter of fact she seemed unhappy. She chose to work retail and chose to be a manager.",0
I didn't like my visit there my french  were col,0
They have the worst service. I went there yesterday and i ordered a sausage McGriddle add cheese and bacon. They gave me a biscuit and i told them the correct order. They told me to park and we waited about 10 min and they gave us the sandwhich but it was a bacon and egg McGriddle . I told them the order again. I waited another 10 minutes and like 3 people came out and asking what my order was and the manager said oh an egg McGriddle like no...where did i say anything about eggs in my sandwhich and that took more time. It took 4 people to get the order right. Not to mention the wait. And on other days i come here the drive thru wait time is 20 min to 1hr. I used to work there and it is literally the worst location and it,0
"It took about 40 minutes to get to the window to order the food.. ok... then it took another 10 or 15 to get the food. The lady was very nice, and took my order correctly... the one who served the food, is the one I have a problem  with. Ordered 2 large combos of big mac. Just to get one big mac and a fish fillet... I mean... (called to see what you can do about it, no answer) If you guys are understaffed you can hire me to do the orders CORRECTLY! Food for thought. And merry Christmas to everyone.",0
I work there and they drop food on the floor and still serve it to you people. Half the time people don't even clean there hands often. And use old grease at times or expired veggie produce.  Sorry guys . They also treat workers like crap unless you kiss ass to them .,0

"Worst McDonald's experience I've ever had. Waited 45 for two double cheeseburgers. Nothing was done besides a annoyed ""sorry"" .Go anywhere else. It would be faster to drive to the store, go home, and cook your own burger. I will not return .",0
Horrible service. All the employees are always clueless. Came to pick up an order and the employee tells me order isn't ready so to park in the front. Waited 15 mins for another employee to come out and tell me that my order was given out already. Told him why did the other employee tell me they are still making my order and he is telling me it was given out already. Had no explanation. Made me waist 30 mins of my time.,0
Never any workers. Tried to make a delivery order at 8pm and they called to say it was close but the person picking up the order said it was open and on the website also said it was open and couldn't cancel my order,0
I went to get four spicy mcChicken with a happy meal and two mcRibs combo. I bought three drinks and they forgot to give me my happy meal and forgot the straws for my drinks. The bread for the mcChickens were Nasty. I understand is very busy but please pay more attention to the food and the service. We pay to eat fresh food not nasty breads. My friends and I went to the beach to have our meals and We couldn't enjoy our drinks because no straws. PLEASE PUT MORE ATTENTION!!!,0
This place needs a whole remodeling. The burger was rubbery and the out side was beyond filthy. My first tax paying J.O.B was McDonald's and I love giving positive feedback. The only positive energy was the lady who handed me my food.,0
They've completely missed my order a few times and I've waited there for around an hour and a half once for my order. I had gone the other day to get a burger and found a hair in it while I was eating it. I think they dropped the burger on the ground or something before giving it to me,0
I feel like they didn cook the fries all the way done !!! And the wait was about 20mins in the drive throw!!! And my bread for the burger taste old ! Like they cooked it this morning or something!!!! ,0
They get your order wrong 9 out of 10 times I go there..the always missing items. They also give you cold food...,0

"Terrible Terrible quality of food and customer service. I have been living in this area for over 30 years, and have noticed the deterioration of this establishment.",0
It's a bad one go down the road to the next one.,0
This is by far the worst store in McDonald's. No one knows what is going on and the woman thatbwas iin charge had no clue what was going on. Sadly we will never chose this McDonald's again. We waited for 45 min for a 20 piece chicken nugget. Sorry to the very nice cashier who did everything she could but had no help from her coworkers or boss.,0
Yesterday was very bad the food was cold and hard and the service wasn't great either no napkins no utensils in the bag I was running late to work if not I would gone back and return everything,0

Terrible service! My order was completely wrong but on my receipt it was right like how hard was to check the items your throwing together smh makes you upset,0

Bro it was very badd service! It took 10-12 minutes in the drive thru just sitting for an order of 1 large iced tea And minute maid freezy,0
"I usually order McDonalds through the drive thru, but the line was very long so I decided to order inside since there was no line. Now I see why everyone orders at the drive thru.

It smelled really bad inside (like a restroom) and the ceiling was leaking behind the food service line which makes me question the quality of the food. On top of that there were homeless people lingering around. One asked me for money TWICE. Once before I ordered and once afterwards. The cashier also didn't know what she was doing, she kept asking the manager for help making service slow.

I would not recommend this McDonalds AT ALL.",0
It took 30 minutes to get my food the frys where cold so I had them make me some more which took extra time. I do not recommend stopping at this McDonalds for any reason. They also didn't have all the ingredients for my sandwich,0
"Do not go to this Mc Donald's!!! It took over 20mins to get my food! I went to use the rest room with my kids and there is a homeless man washing his underwear in the sink! Then as we were looking for a table, there were people sleeping in the seats! The place was dirty, but the workers were nice. Over-all I would recommend the you pass this eatery by!!

The food here has to be the worst I ever had. My big mac tasted like it was a Day old and the buns were hard as a brick. I didn't even try to ask for another one I just threw it away. Terrible.,0
"Unacceptable, I ordered 2 Kids Meal from the drive thru from this location I didn't get the Nuggets for both kids meals, I went into the restaurant to speak with an employer they refused to replace my the missing items. my kids were unhappy. Having to pay and not receiving your complete order especially the main meal is unsatisfactory... Never coming to this Mc Donald's",0
Orders are being handed out not in sequence the cashier was excellent but the assistant in the light blue shirt who did not have a name badge and wouldn't write down her name for me was not the nicest person for your establishment if it was up to me and I knew she was going to be there I would not show up to your establishment ther just letting you know but your cashier was very good in taking orders the handout you need a lot of help there thank you and have a blessed day,0
"drive thru is hell!!!! if you are thinking to go thru the drive thru... are you willing to spend 15-20 min?!?!? hell to the no! not just the drive thru is the issue but the fries is burnt and stiff, the coke is FLAT! also make sure to have cash because they will surprise you ""at the moment we are not accepting card payment"" pretty much thats my experience here...",0

Don't ever come though the drive through. It takes so long to get your food. I'm waiting 30 mins and I can't even get out of here. I'm stuck in between cars. Please avoid this place and drive another 10 mins to the next McDonald's. Trust me it'll be a lot faster than ordering food here.,0
McDonalds aint been the same since the end of 2011 when I noticed they went down hill and continue to slide to the bottom. Only people born in the 90's on back know how McDonlds use to be. They food is garbage. All fake and tasteless,0
"Slow service, bad area after hours, not very safe to eat in, recommend drive through. the food is consistent for the most part. the staff is ok but can be better. getting in and out can be cumbersome. not the best place for a date or families. It's ideal for a quick stop and go only.",0
"Slowest service ever. Order was cold and incomplete. Oatmeal was just a mush with the fruits separate. Pancakes had no butter or syrup. The eggs in the sandwich was burnt and cheese was not even melted. HORRIBLE, AVOID THIS LOCATION.",0
The worst McDonald's experience of my life they seemed confused and unprofessional they didn't know how long my order would take yet they where serving people after me they ordered and got their food then left meanwhile I waited 20minuits and had to leave without the food because every time I asked how long they ignored me and walked away without any answers would not recommend to anyone.,0
"Very bad service, Employees were so rude not only to me but to others. They had 5 workers 1 lady in the back cooking 1 young girl taking orders and 3 workers on one phone laughing. When my daughter finally got her meal her food was literally just toss to her.",0
Always a disappointment. Asked for fresh hot fries they were not fresh but somehow I had to pull over and wait for an ice coffee because they had to get the milk.They took so long I asked for money back!!,0
Wow only if this had a negative scale index because I would've given this particular McDonald's a negative -5 for the service and upkeep.. The food was cold and they had around 3 people passed out and drooling on the table 1 in the restroom some lady which my daughter could not use the restroom fire the entire visit.. Any ways this place needs help,0
"worst speed  and service, waiting more than half hour for a order, don",0
I ordered an eminem mcflurry and so they charged me. After they charged me I waited 10 mins just so someone can come and tell me that they didnt have mcflurry. Like why tf would you charge me and make me wait?,0
"I wouldn't recommend McDonalds food to anyone for what should be obvious reasons . Stopping there was not my idea. Although, charging only a BUCK for a large soft drink was avery, very, very SMART move.  I'm sure millions go in to purchase a pop/soda & end up spending maybe on average say $5.00",0
"It was the worst! I ordered my food from the machine I paid at 1:31pm at 2:00 i was just getting my food and i was quite upset everyone there was upset once i spoke to the manager she was no help they only had one person making the food, and from where I was standing they were only giving the food to the drive through customer.

So I received my food and the fries were cold and I ask for fresh food, so they took the cold fries and I waited again when CDC the manage gave me a new bag I thought the order was correct I made it to my car and I went to eat some of my fries and it was a small fries and it had a toy in the bag, so now I am so mad I just drove off and I called and let them know and the lady that answered she told lj e to bring my recipe and they would take care of it. DONT GO TO THE MAC DONALD ON CENTERY AND FIG THE WORST SERVICE. THE MADE MECRATE I DID NOT WANT TO GIVE THEM A STAR BUT IT WOULD NOT LET ME POST WITHOUT GIVENVTHEM ONE STAR.",0
Wrong order... waited on the drive through 20 minutes and another 30 wait g on my order.. like 15 other people were there also complaining about they're order ... never going there again..,0
McDonald's can go away have you had the big mc with the small as patty its all to oneside and the other side is all buns get home and those skinny fries are hard and cold mc donalds will never get my money ever again that's just me.,0
"Nasty bland no flavor, meat undercooked no salt on fries.  No shakes no ice cream. Morning staff gave me muffin with no patty.this location needs help. And or new staff. Management is doing. Poor job.",0
Very slow and not friendly or customer service oriented,0
"It was the worst experience, they didnt have anymore fries, took a long time to take orders, no sauce inside the bag",0
This place is super slow at the drive thru i was in that line for 50 min to get a simple happy meal for my kid this is not part of a fast food restaurant with that kind of time,0
Always is a long waiting time I expend 37 minutes in the drive thru only for one happy meal don't visit this McDonald's unless you like to wait more then 30 minutes.,0
More than 20 minutes for fast food and we kept getting skipped. Management needs to improve. Drive through workers are extremely rude.,0
My food was cold and very messy my drinks were watered down with no ice and because of the pain didn't make the diner is not open so you have to go through the drive-thru and the drive-thru is so crowded you don't want to get back in line is very disappointed makes me not want to go back to that McDonald's again,0
Unfortunately food was cold and was missing a lot of things,0
I know it's fast food but can the coffee not be so damn watered down I should have asked for a water cup in that case . My ice coffee was nothing but water with sugar. Waste,0
"Very slow compared to other McDonald's. Very cheap. Ran out of coke, no box for my happy meal, 3 different crack heads came up to me begging.",0
"Mc donals its ok but the inside omg !
Crazy people
sleeping , screaming , it stinks like hobos theres blankets in the chairs and bikes everywere including the restrooms
And  hallways  its loud with diferent music and there always someone screamin to each other inside not save enviroment for kids or teens.",0
They use freeze tactics to keep the homeless out but forget about the paying customers. WAY TO COLD to eat here and i prefer 70 and below temp.,0
"I have never been to slower McDonald in my life ! All the staff sit back and gossip while we wait about 20 min for just one burger...
If yo",0
This is the most slowest McDonald's ever and how do you advertise eating around the world or whatever it's called and have a ice cream that looks very good but can't try it cause the ice cream machine is forever broken just false advertising and poor time management,0
The drive-through is so slow. Went at night and saw that the line was long but I figured it'll be moving. . . Nope. I was third to last and was in the same spot for like 15mins. It was ridiculous. I ended up backing up and leaving.,0
Come here several times and some people here being having an attitude and just very slow service,0
Last time I got my kid a happy meal with 6 peice chicken nuggets and when I got home my kid said cookie they placed a cookie inside the box of chicken nuggets didn't go back and complain because I thought it was funny but this place needs help ..so slow,0
It seems like Uber Eat Is Way More Important Than The Actual Customer's. Thay Are Standing In Line Waiting To Be Helped..,0
"Thai McDonalds is disgusting. The bathrooms were horrific, with no toilet paper in the stalls (not even a toilet paper dispenser). And filthy tables. Additionally, there were individuals loitering outside cat-calling people walking by. Avoid if possible.",0
One of the worst McDonald's restaurants  that i ever visited.the air conditioning doesnt work. The service was poor only 1 attendant working the cash register and the line was filled with angry customers who grew inpatient with the workers who worked for that McDonald's,0
Never Ever Go to that Mc Donalds or any other Mc Donalds.  They Are Horrible.  Go to Farmer Boys 2 miles down the Road. Youll Much Happier,0
"Worst customer service ever , ugliest attitudes ever , what a disappointment and disgust",0
This McDonald's is one of the worst McDonald's I have ever been to in my whole life and I've been to a lot the food was cold no sweet tea ever and they take forever and worst of all they don't even care how anyone feels about anything I think this place should be torn down,0
I JUST SPENT 30 mins IN THE DRIVE THRU. THE LADY AT THE WINDOW HAD PRACTICALLY NO EXPERIENCE AND SOMEONE ELSE TOOK OVER FOR HER AFTER 20 MINS OF WAITING FOR HER TO TAKE MY ORDER.,0
"Currently it's drive-thru only and this is the second time that they forget items on my order. This time I decided to return to get my full meal as ordered. Unfortunately, I found that this would cost me more in time and frustration. I need a new franchise close to me...",0
I considered 3 stars for the food temperature (hot)but giving I waited 26 mn in line  I was not accepting anything less. I'm not sure of the cause but clearly this location needs a time assessment!,0
"I really dont like coming to this mcdonals bt cause is close to my house i always end up going there..I figure if I퐉 spending gas & time to go else were minus well spend time waiting there ..
this mcdonalds is the worse, the fact that t",0
One of the worst McDonald's I've been to. Bathrooms locked and looked trashed. Food was hot but drink seemed like it was sitting around before given to us.,0
They closed the drive thru early and would not take my order made me sit in the line for 15 mins before speaking and telling me there closed at 1:55,0
"Went for a pick up and took over 20 minutes to get the food, Three other customers got there after me and got their food before me.",0
Place says it closes at 2am instead they block the window with cones 5min prior... unacceptable open to close is just that. Management here needs to be evaluated,0
"Got home and half my order wasn't in the bag, the peppermint ice coffee tasted like it came off a lunch truck, always check your bag..!!",0
Horrible service not only did I get the wrong order it took a long time to correct it and she put my cream and sugar inside my coffee when I asked for it out,0
"Fries were cold, service ok, the kiosk machine wasn't working right, this place needs a change in it been like this for a long time.... Better service and fresher food...",0
"This is the worst McDonald in food quality
My drive thru experience was awful.  Missing items,  no ketchup even though I asked for it. Anyway  ... Not a location to visit again.",0
"Very slow restaurant
15 min for a happy meal i though this was a fast food restaurant",0
I had Order sweet tea with no ice with lemon when i got my order the tea unsweet with ice and no lemon employees was lack on my order,0
The drink is not full!! No matter is light ice,0
"This MCD is always missing some of your food, and or condiments why ask what sauce do you want if the morons at the window don't give em' to you. But they want a raise right?",0
"Slowest McDonald's we've been to. They're usually so fast, so we decided to stop here when in a hurry. This one was very slow",0
Mc Donald's has a contract with Uber to give all drivers free coffee this one does not.,0
I ordered a unsweetened black tea. I was told to wait outside for my tea meanwhile it brewed... I waited well over 10min nearly 15min in the hot sun and got tired of waiting and drove home.,0
It always packed. Driv,0
Love the food but they take a bit too much in the drive thru,0
"They always take a long time at this location.  I have to come here because it's the closest to my house and it needs to be warm for my kid, otherwise I would go somewhere else!",0
Took too long and did not give me all of items,0
"Horrible aggressive customers, I feel bad for the employees. Long lines inside and out. Efficient employees at the time I went.",0
"Thee worst! Ice tea is horrible,  customer service is horrible,  and so nasty, no matter how many chances you give them,  you still get disappointed. Everytime",0
Was in line for 15 minutes did my order was wrong,0
"Only 5 cars ahead and we waited at the drive thru over 25 minutes before we gave up. And after all that time, there were still 2 cars ahead of us!!",0
Takes to long to get one cup of coffee in the morning I drive to a McDonald's 4 miles over just because they know time is money 占쏙,0
"Tooooo slow, rudeness, not a scence of customer service, restrooms are horrible and the wait is over 30 minutes.",0
Very unsatisfied the line was long moving very slowly they only had one window open so the same person that was charging was bagging the food and when I got home I was missing two items,0
"Waited 30 whole ass min for a drink , way to crowded . managers give attitude . people working slow , lines always be long because cashiers aleays leaving the register .. Bad service",0
Worst Mcdonalds I have ever been to. Really rude employees and they take FOREVER for the simplest happymeal order.,0
Literally asked the cashier to make sure my fries had salt when I placed my order.... got my order and you guessed it... fries were saltless,0
Took 20 mins to get through drive through and food was cold. Not the best,0
"Didn't have all menu items, fries weren't freshly cooked. Service remarkably slow.",0
"Drive thru is the worst!!!
Sitting here for ten minutes an have not moved
Saturday at 1:50pm 8/25/18

Five cars in front of me, if I could I would leave!

Never again",0
Crowded and service not very good. They gave me the wrong drink and no ketchup for my fries,0
Drive thru take 30 or more minutes.  Waiting inside take to long to get your food. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone that in a rush...,0
WAITED 45 MINUTES FOR MY FOOD AND WHEN I FINALLY GET MY FOOD THE FRIES ARE OLD AND THE PATTIES ARE STILL FROZEN . BTW THERE WAS A HOMELESS SLEEPING RIGHT NEXT TO ME  NEVER GOING TO THIS MC DONALDS AGAIN,0
Very slow 20 min in the drive through and haven't gotten my food yet.,0
"Tajanay i think thats how you spell her name, she is about the only one that shows respect when coming thru the drive thru, no attitude or anything",0
The food was good..but the service was lousy it took almost a half hour just to receive my order which was only a burger fries and drink,0
The worst I went to this location last night to get some chicken nuggets and fries they had mine food just sitting while waiting for another person in front of me by the time I got my notice they were hard cold couldn't even eat them I'll never go to this McDonald's again,0
They were very slow and it took me 20 min to get my food in the drive threw and they ain't prepared and on top of there orders they slack off (bad review),0
It was awful the service sucked I spent 20 minutes trying to get a McFlurry Harbor Place if you're in a hurry three people came after me and left way before me,0
Disgusting food.  McDonalds is horrible these days.  Food prepared like it was thrown  together by animals..  ZERO STARS,0
They are very very ghetto...they take 4ever to do orders too....no kind of customer service...need to have customer training service...too many youngsters....orders are always a mess up...need to be aware of folks coming up to your car asking for change...service is slow inside too....,0
Slowest drive thru ever never will i come to this mofo take 30 mins for what.....,0
Poor service. Need new management and workers,0
Ordered a quarter pounder and got a fish fillet instead smh messed up my order,0
Waited for 25 minutes for a cup of coffee after telling the manager about my order she didn't know about and she was taking orders bad customer service don't stop here.,0
Service was extremely slow  and order was incorrect.  Employee that gave me the order was very nice and corrected the order.,0
They need to learn how to treat people better talk to people better hire better team members and managers.,0
It wsas a bad service for a breakfast just waiting for 10minutes in line to order,0
"Lady at the drive thru made a mistake and we talked to her we we're courteous, and she mad dogged and had an attitude.",0
Service sucks and they take forever for preped food,0
Probably the most unprofessional staff ever. They tried to justify they close early by multiple  reasons and ,0
"Where service ever Will not go back there again bed service lazy workers S on scent that songs imperium figoroa and. On figoroa,",0
If I could give zero stars I would I퐒e been living here for the past year and service hasn,0
It always smell never clean take long time to complete my oreder and  the people there never smile and talk very low,0
"This place is pathetic. We tried to get a late night meal but apparently it stops at 12am. As we tried to order some other drinks, and they claim that the soda machine is down. Epic fail.",0
Slowest drive thru ever longest lines they need faster workers,0
"Terrible, slow drive through, Horrible service. It might not be the worst,..  but its close.",0
The worst customer service ever never get order right they get annoyed when you are trying to see what you want your push to make an order with having the time to decided awful,0
For fast food it was slow and really not clean like trash,0
It took 50 minutes to receive my order dining in. There was no organization and to top it all off the food with cold what a waste of $27 sorry Ronald maybe next time,0
Love their coffee! I roam throughout LA and it's Worst one in the city as far as service.,0
Man...  most of the time this place this place it's slow...   not as efficient as other mc Donald's I've visited,0
Everybody in the restaurant does not know how to add or subtract. I hate this place! Negative -0 stars,0
Crappy service.  Couldn't get anything right about a simple order. And false advertising on the time frame or deals. DONT GO HERE.,0
This mcdonald is horrible. Bad costumer service through drive thrue . i do not recommend this mcdonald to anyone . I hate this mcdonald and will always hate it . Kay  .kay,0
McDonald's is a place where it's hard to get what I want the way I want it without having to wait extra time. The problem is that they put onions on everything.,0
Dude literally we ate raw meat once we took a bite !! ,0
It seem like every one was on some type of drug jus didn't seem like they zombies,0
Ordered a meal the only thing that was bad was a fries there were hard felt like I was chewing on rocks never get fries here especially at night time,0
They left us waiting for over 30 minutes,0
"Too long at the drive through line, it was more than 30minutes, I got really mad...",0
"I ordered fish falete ,small fries , and two sausage and egg biscuit . And they forgot my small fries",0
This Mcdonalds always takes a long time. Their managers are always rude as well.,0
Didn't have any more packs of peanuts for the sundaes... Disappointing and this is at 7 pm!,0
Management need more training they dont know how to direct their employees,0
Waiting time is long,0
The drive thru has a very slow service even when there is no line,0
F***** up service the night crew always runs out of whatever u need something is always missing as a matter of fact I went and complained and the girl at the window got mad after I told her I was missing half my order.,0
"Rude service, inconsiderate, unprofessional,",0
Really bad ugly services,0
"Very disappointed, no pankes for breakfast, no hot sauce, manager very rude I forgot her name",0
Transient beggar IN THE DRIVE THRU HASSELING PATRONS and no staff did anything about it. Worst experience ever,0
A much needed effort in prompt customer service and cleanliness.,0
"3 o'clock in the morning and I had to wait 40 minutes in the drive thru, it makes no sense at all",0
No order in. Covid 19 you sure did a number on us.,0
You forgot to tell people their is very few 24 hour Mickey Dees... And when u find one open.....very limited on drinks.,0
They focuses on coffee or sodas refill to much to a point they ask you for recip of purchase,0
Drive thru is always always packed and your order isn't fresh,0
They take a long time to give the food.,0
I wanted something on my stomach and my granddaughter had a happy meal,0
"Order are never ready , dinnin always close for some reason",0
"Staff very friendly, but dinning room always has some sort of commotion going on...",0
Took a long time to have my food ready in the drive thru,0
What stands out more than the very slow service is the bad attitudes of 90% of the employees in front of the house.,0
poor service missed a sandwich no cream or sugar for coffee,0
My Grand Big Mac was dry and the meat was hard. I will not go there again,0
We been on the drive through line 20 mins and it hasnt moved,0
Trash Service. The Bag with my food in it had some type substance on the bag that got my hands.,0
"When I'm up early in the morning,I can't stop there for early meals,so I'm lead to go to 711 store.",0
I find it scary sometimes... They take forever with the orders.. Nearly 30 Min wait..,0
Never has my caramel macchiato always says machines not working,0
Bad service never coming back here drivetrhu.super slow.,0
Line horrible long fries cold sandwich awesome,0
They never get your order right not even when you tell em at the counter NO CHEESE..IDIOTS,0
"Food is horrible, never fresh...only get drinks from THIS McDonald's",0
More than a 20 minute wait poorly staffed.might be because of halloween,0
A lot of people through the drive-through the take to long to help people in sight the same thing they're slow,0
Takes too long to get your order. The person  taking your money always look mad.,0
The sausage and egg and cheese McMuffins always hit the spot for me,0
I only get drinks here McDonald's has bad food google there ingredients to the meet beware McDonald's is trying to knock us all off,0
Not a full menu ..there's no chicken sandwich at 10:30 pm ..,0
"There women's restroom needed to be cleaned desperately, I had to report it to the manager",0
Longest line ever.  And k only wanted fries and oreo mcflurry,0
You'll be attacked in the drive-through and management does nothing.  Unsafe.,0
Prices are to high and lines are to long for quality of food,0
the slowest mc donalds in the hood.... they dont care about us,0
Slowest drive thru i ever been in.Customer service was horrible.,0
Scary parking lot. Too many transients making deals.  Awesome food,0
"Waited in line for 25 mins only to get to speaker and someone comes on and says CASH ONLY,       REALLY???",0
"They had No Filet Fish today,that what I came there for",0
"Was very  slow and was not clean, homeless in and out asking  for money and not food",0
Bun was dry and fries seemed like they were sitting for a while,0
They take their time a little too much.,0
The drive thrue line is always so long. The night shift is so slow,0
Drive thru is bad especially the wait no matter how many cars there is.,0
"45 minutes to 1 hour in drive drive thru, I don't get it.",0
It happens at all McDonald's,0
"This . place . socks too many homeless ,.the.owner.is.very rude . with . The customer so no . respect.",0
Bad service didn't get my order complete.,0
Take to long to serve you took 30 mins,0
I always take long. And always mess up on your orders.,0
"Another BAD experience at this McDonald's! It makes no sense the things they do!! Pray, pray pray!!",0
stale fries had to ask for remake there oil wasnt filtered good enough,0
Bad service not a good McDonald's to come n eat!,0
The bums outside make you not want to come here and the service was slow,0
Not enough staff too accommodate for their clientele,0
Nasty bathrooms & vagrants/homeless people which is very uncomfortable.... be aware of your surroundings,0
"The place was filthy,  the ladies room was closed,  and I  paid Starbucks prices at a crummy McDonald's.",0
Food order wrong. 1 person taking orders and serving drive up orders and counter. To long of wait.,0
Drink machine disgusting I just wanted Sweet Tea ugh!,0
all the employees speak spanish and there was homeless people farting inside,0
Slow as freaking molasses.. Customer service sucks too,0
I just wanted to use the restroom and got kicked.,0
"To many people, the place is so nasty and slow service.",0
This is one if the nastiest McDonald's EVER ... The service here is TERRIBLE,0
Only good thing is their coffee.,0
Poor service didn't receive what I ordered ,0
Gives just 1 coffee refill becythe neighborhood is poor. Lame.,0
Clean but too expensive for fast food.,0
Long wait in drive thru and wrong order,0
Didn't get all my order- I feel scammed :(,0
"4 consecutive weeks, Every Monday the dining room is not swept or mopped. They don't open at 530am. For the last month on Mondays they won't have orange juice. They say the machine doesn't work and they can't serve it. The cashier tells me Some other worker will squeeze the orange because it's freshly squeezed. I would understand one mistake, but it's occurring every Monday.",0
"My daughter, her friends and i was at this particular McDonalds while visiting the boardwalk (out of town visitors). There was roaches all over the place and they were big. The place was not clean. Homeless people surrounded the place.  I will never go back and i have already told a lot of people that were headed that way.",0
"Waited in line for half an hour, and it seemed like forever at the pick-up window.  I asked if they were short staffed, and she said they were waiting on the fries. But when I got them they were cold. She offered no explanation until I got tired of waiting",0
"this McDonald's is more expensive than others in the area, and be warned that individuals in their garage are very sensitive to the fact if you have your phone out and become vocallyworried that you are taking pictures or video of them.",0
"Frequently at this location, someone is spewing toxic gases into the air, violating local laws (& humane rights; despite a security guard on site).
Cashiers are expected to be able to actually perform elementary subtraction, such as 12-7=5; (because the US doesn't mint 3 dollar bills) and I already have enough singles to stuff Magic Mike's g-string.
If this location has take out hours & dining room hours, that should be posted; on entry ways & online. Otherwise, we patrons expect to sit down, not be told the seating area is closed 30 minutes prior to closing and 20+ minutes after opening. MGMT should schedule site & employee hours accordingly.",0
"Rude staff asked the manager about the birthday grimace promotion and she said ""I don't know"" and walked away.",0
Did not help me with a refund and took awhile to convince worker to take a look at kiosk to fix it.,0
"Honestly the worst McDonald's, you'd expect more from one by the beach and turns out to be the worst experience.",0
I'm really disappointed in McDonald's in Santa monica went got food to take to husband and the drink carrier broke they wouldn't give me a replacement for my loss had to reorder and replace myself they were ice coffee and a mocha frappe,0
Horrible service walked in with wife an 3 kids ordered 3 pancake meals an 2 sandwich meals 5 people 5 meals they called our order got 1 pancake 2 sandwiches no full meals had to wait as they dissed us in Spanish (I speak it I know what you said) then get my other 2 pancakes but they absolutely refused to give me 2 hash browns will not stop again,0
"Full of homeless people not like I'm unaware of our global situation with homelessness, but if you looking to sit down chill and eat don't do it at this one. It doesn't have a drive thru, so order ahead for pick up, it does have self service ordering kiosk.",0
Homeless hang out ! Every day customers are being attacked in the store why security guards stand around and watch !,0
"SOOOO busy, all I ordered was a drink and who knows who actually got it!",0
"This is hands down THE worst McDonald's ever! The staff are rude, racist, and intentionally slow. Don't waste your time. There was a fistfight in the dining area and the men's room was full of weed smoke.",0
"Very bad service the employees are very roud the security guy not professional
I won't never come back to this ugly store",0
Waited 20 minutes for a mobile order that they have to serve to our table. Finally I went to the counter and asked about my order. They rudely said they don do table s,0
They fired me for refusing service to a rude customer,0
"Not happy with that location!
Dining room has a big sign in window stating Dining room open. But yet it was not open. It was 12:00 in the afternoon!! Why wasn't it open?! It seems that they have their own rules!
Plus wasn't allowed to order at window either! I don't have a car, I was on my bike.",0
"Horrible customer service and they messed up my order. The lady who took my order was rushing and had a rude attitude. She didn even listen to what I wanted. She kept staring at me and almost forced me to get something easier off the menu, as I had ordered somet",0
The worker could not get my order on time and had an attitude,0
So I come in for my daily coffee but need to use the restroom and of course you have to buy before you can use the restroom and wash hands ,0
"Order was screwed up, and the hash browns in both combo meals were barely cooked to just above raw.
Amazing their staff could screw up two breakfast meals in the same order in an automated process. SAD.",0
"To many young kids was there
the place was to busy for family & tourism",0
"Had to go and wipe my 5 star review and turn it to a 2 star since last year this whole place has turned into yet another slow Hispanic ran restaurant. Used to have a diverse staff and be consistently speedy and hot, now it takes 10 mins with no one else in line to get some fries and nuggets?while everyone is standing around twiddling their thumbs, I퐒e been here at least 60 times, and every time I퐒e been here post COVID reopening it been this same situation with the change of the whole employee personnel now it",0
It's a McDonald's that food is the same as every other McDonald's is decent didn't like the place because it was too crowded too messy and took forever just to get a soda or no people were nice workers were nice,0
The worst and most expensive McDonalds I have ever seen. I had to request a manager to intervene before the cashier would let me order what I wanted instead of what she wanted me to buy. Definitely not a happy meal.,0
"On Nov 22//21, I went to use the men restroom and it was so filthy and because this is a place where a lot people visit the attention to the restrooms should be made more often",0
Definitely everything has changed in this McDonald location. The food was alright what I didn like was the area location homeless getting crazy inside the restaurant. Looks like the one security who,0
"The locations looks great and has 8 of machines that allow you to order and pay, but the service was horrible. I ordered a sundae for my mom and after 10 minutes of waiting, I saw one employee feel a tear in her pants below her butt and then she went and fixed herself a sundae and left. At this same moment another came up and asked about the sundaes for his family that he ordered 20 minutes prior. I was given a refund without fuss before leaving. The bad part to all of this was there were about 12 people working at the location during my visit which was more than enough to prepare and delivery the food quickly.",0
"This Black lady at cash register took my order fine, another black lady with dark blue shirt red brown hair served my food.
Minutes later I return one item was made wrong!
Same black lady asked her staff to fix it then she gave it to me without checking it and I find out that they did it wrong again! I took to her for the third time and then she asked her staff again to do it again!
Instead of making sure it done correct! She proceeded to go help another customer which took her about 4 to 5 minutes when she knew I come first but she didn care! I asked her again when she returned to her post where is my food and She got quickly defensive with me and refuse to get me a hot free fries since I had to wait too long for my order!
I throw away my cold fries and just proceeded to get the hell out of there!!
I am done arguing with these black or not black l management fault!! They just hire any one for the job and they don pay attention to what goes on in thei",0
So overall they usually have one of the fastest services especially when it comes to McDonald's in regards to what I'm doing doordash. Only problem being at this location is a hub for intoxicated panhandling homeless people.,0
"The People Who Work There Were Very Rude&Short In Response.
There Parking Garage Is Hazardous!!",0
"Really rude staff, too bad service. Avoid if you can. There are so many other better places to eat or drink around.
They would literally cheat you!",0
"Too many homeless people that kept walking in and out of this location, we couldn't eat comfortably because they smelled so bad as they passed by. I understand they can't help it due to their situation but if you have a hard time tolerating body odor of various homeless people walking back and forth in this McDonald's location then you should definitely avoid this location.",0
"This plave is not a good place. They used to have blacks there too. Now all hispanic and trey just remodeled. All of sudden after the remodel all the staff all like the same race. I though McDonald's was equal opportunity employer. Guess not. Today I went there to use the restroom. I was told I couldn't use the restroom unless I bought something. I explained that it was an emergency and I just have to take a number one and I will be on my way. I asked to speak to the manager, the manager told me the same thing you have to buy something. I told the manager I really had to use the restroom it was an emergency I'll be in and out that's all I need it and I was still denied. Every time I come to this place is always something. Things to give me cold food all the time I would ask for fresh food and they would make me wait 20 to 30 minutes I would just wait while standing there looking at her. I wasn't really strong with expressing myself oh, now I express myself a little bit more. I just thought that everybody should know is this place really isn't a nice place to be I wouldn't give them a dime of my money. When did they treat people and I've always treated people is not okay if I was a business owner in a McDonald's along to me I would fire the entire staff shut the McDonald's down and start new with the whole new staff of all Races and ethnicities different religions in different ways of being themselves instead of running it like Fort Knox and no one even speaks English. Not a respectable place and I think a lot of changes need to happen. The last thing that we all need is a petition being signed to shutdown a very nasty, disrespectful, unprofessional in very unreliable restaurant in one of the most popular places in California. Let's get back together McDonald's or else I'll go to the next level and bringing all these customers that also it's like this McDonald's. We even go one more step above and bring the in all your future customers who have never been there before just to mention on how they've had experiences at McDonald's that were so exceptionally great and then compare it to the way that you treat all the customers who've walked out of McDonald's and see if they'll never come back I don't think we want this to be a topic of discussion.",0
I ordered from here twice and I ordered a cheeseburger with bacon and onions and the first time they didn even put the bacon on it (The bacon that I spend my money on) and now they didn put the onion on it.,0
"Very bad exp, I believe I goten bad food.",0
"if you're a tourist DON'T go to McDonald's especially this one, rude service, poor choice, worst fast food chain in US by far",0
No dollar menu anything but drinks here! Even coffee is 2 bucks! The service is spotty and confusing at best! The place is small and serves the end of the busiest street that leads to the pier....ultra poor planning on space for quality of service/business. There are a lot kf vagrants at this location but they are for the most part harmless.,0
They allow the homeless to beg in front of their door and people buy them food so they go inside and eat. The problem is their smell!!! We bring our tourists families and end up totally embarrassed.,0
"Manager sucks. I called her over for help and she ignored me. Seating arrangements are disorganized. The soda fountain machine is always dirty. Hardly any ice. When you press for a certain soda, it runs water for a while. Too many homeless people. The only decent thing here is the food.",0
"Worst McDonald's in the world, that's a big statement but its the only one that fits.
I ordered breakfast on a Saturday. It wasn't too busy but when I got my food I was missing some sandwiches, my pancakes were super cold like if they had just defrosted them and put them in my bag and the hashbrowns were literally stuck to the wrapper and the bag they came in looked like it had been dunked in the deep frier.

Save your money, go eat somewhere else where the food is actually edible.
To clarify I'm not bagging on all McDonald's, I quite like the food BUT this location is terrible, my suggestion is to go elsewhere",0
Got my order wrong took forever to serve my sweet tea. Crispy chicken had a large piece of not so crispy chicken w/ the foulest tasting sauce I'll never order again  watered down sodas so much you'd think it was club soda. Never again,0
We asked for a cup of water after we were done eating our food inside. Lady said we needed to purchase until she seen my orange juice cup.. she then proceeded to give us a tiny cup. What exactly were we supposed to do with that? Meanwhile others got a decent sized cup for water. What do you lose to give out a cup of WATER?,0
"This McDonald is always very busy so I understand why their customer service isn the best.

Even so, I still don understand",0
"I expect crowding because it's close to the beach. The ice machine is always out, they don't have enough fresh brewed tea to refill the container, and some of the employees have attitude. The security guard tends to trip, but it's not always the same guard. Service is pretty fast considering the volume of customers. I only go there because of proximity.",0
"No Refills!  It took about 10 minutes for me and everyone else in line to get their order done. They could only give you 3 ranch for 20 Chicken Nuggets, not even 4. Fo",0
"This was an ok McDonald, but I liked going to this place because it was so busy during the summer, so you are more likely to get hot and fresh food. Now that it December 2020, they are slacking, I guess they are having more problems with the homeless or druggies or drug dealers outside of their business, but twice in the last two weeks I got cold and half-cooked fries after 9pm.

Maybe because I퐉 a gang stalking victim, this is happening.  REPORT ANY AND ALL COMPLAINTS TO CORPORATE.

On December, 13th 2020, I got the free double cheeseburger, it was a cold burger a",0
Loads of homeless people around,0
Food was not hot fries to salty,0
"Go anywhere else. Not here. Beyond the counter, this place is never clean.  Glorified truck stop.  Too many other options, next door and, nearby that are more deserving of your business. Especially, since the ""dining room"" is no longer open 24 hours.  No drive through. Sad. Literally, steps from the pier. The collective grime of all of Santa Monica resides on this location surrounding sidewalks. The homeless aren't the issue.  It is the mentally disturbed , the hustlers  and questionable addicts. This is not a family friendly location.  Wisely most families recognize this and steer clear.  These truths sometimes slip pass the trained smiles of the cashiers and you see the weariness and defeat.  No other business has these issues!  Not one.  Food?  No problems.",0
I got a raw meat burger. It was cooked outside of it. But inside under the part was cooked was very raw meat. That was unfit to eat. And made me sick. I don't prefer NO body to go eat their at all they will. Kill you with uncooked meat in your burgers.,0
No drive thru; there is a parking lot area; very busy and chaotic; service was reasonable.,0
Had been driving for several hours and needed to use the restroom before ordering. But employee was refusing to open the locked bathroom before I ordered. Extremely rude. At least it was clean and food was ok.,0
"If I could do 0 stars I would. There is no place to lock a bike so I had to take it in with me. The ecurity guard?tried to get me to leave because I have a bike. I퐉 not leaving a $3,000 bike at the door with all these homeless people around who will steal anything. Then they refused to take my order because I wouldn lea",0
"No drink refills.
Bad service ",0
"Worst McDonalds ever.  Customer service is non existant. They act like they're doing you a favor by letting you order food in their establishment. Then it took 20 minutes to get a simple order. Heard MANY complaints while we waited. All McDonald's are worse since the kiosks came in, but this location is a disaster.  Avoid .",0
They used to be super cool! Since the remodel they turned into nazis! No water without a receipt. The stupid guard started a fight with a homeless man who came in. I dont know who sprayed it but pepper spray was sprayed. There were little kids in there. Cleared the place out. They are trying way too hard to not help ANYBODY,0
"Ordered a triple cheeseburger & when I opened up my burger it was single, I go up & say it's wrong and I get ""We don't have triple cheeseburgers"". Apparently putting 3 patties on a burger is prohibited, but other locations are fine with me ordering this. Will not be returning.",0
"Filthy place, both dining area and rest rooms. Staff member who took our order didn't know what an Americano was, even though it's on their own coffee menu, buttermilk chicken tenders were inedible, looked amd felt like it had been reheated too many times.",0
Poor customer service with the cashier,0
"Worst one I've ever been to! They were rude, an employee was arguing with a customer plus it was super dirty! We walked out!",0
"I need to use the bathroom facilities before I ordered. Mind you, the line was long. I was refused until I purchased something which was my intention but first thing first. The manager as well as security staff were very rude. I will never step foot into that place again.",0
"At first, I felt hungry so I went to this very fancy Mickey D's.  But then while getting back home ( which was a long way from the Santa Monica Pier ) I felt nostalgic and my stomach was hurting really bad.  So I had to stop at Carl's Jr. on  Newhall for the bathroom.",0
"Worst customer service ever. Manager is rude and racist. I have been there twice and have witnessed the bad training of employees. Manager in nightshift charge wont help out at all. And I witness how rude she was to some customers, and when I asked to talk to a manager she insulted me and turned me away .  Mcdonalds. You should take complaints into consideration. All those complaints from us the customers.  I'm afraid if I go again instead of a big mac I'll get a mcwhooping.",0
"This review is for the young lady that worked the night of April 7th, she was repeating the ticket numbers to customers after her cowoker behind the counter yelled out the numbers. I was standing with all the other people waiting for their orders. I hear my order get called, i grab it, and she tells me 퐇et me see your ticket im literally right here?.. Ahhhh of course your right there but since im also right here Ill go ahead and grab it since im there with my ticket in hand mind you. To the lady with braides and glasses who appears to be the age of a co",0
The worst service ever... the people behind us got their orders but our order never been processed. We decided to cancel our order instead. The manager never apologized for that error. I still got the receipt. If ever the corporate head wants to contact me I am willing to give them what took place in that McDonald's. I hope the manager will get fired for it!!!!,0
"No refills, ruins the Mcdonalds tradition. Staff is nice , but its too packed and not to much staff to help getting drinks.. Bring back the soda machine.",0
Too many homeless hang out in front of here. A lot of them are violent. No drink refills here because people would take cups out of the trash and steal soda.,0
"Cold food, not prepared as ordered. Complained and they didn't seem to care. Would not recommend at all .",0
"Cashier had her hair in a ponytail and so did all the other workers (that's not allowed , servsafe states you can only have you're hair in a braid or bun when working with food) one of the cooks had on of the sides her shirt in a knot exposing her lower right stomach. I asked the manager and he said the cashier had her hair down in a pony tail because she was almost leaving and the chick with the shirt up was because he shirt got in the way of her cleaning. OH! BTW she was cooking and sweeping with out washing hands !.",0
This place is dirty and employees don't care. Also homeless hangout here all day everyday. It's a good thing police come here often so they keep crime down.,0
"Attitude. Lack of knowledge of procedures. Terrible customer service. The place is filthy. Who runs this place? Definitely not a place I would recommend if you're having a good day. This place will ruin that, wholesale. Good riddance.",0
The old lady on the cashier is so RUDE. She speaks poorly english and is rude.,0
"Massive homelessness dirty outside.
No parking NO drive thru security more worried about masks then the drugs dealing at the door.",0
"Horrible service after the remodeling. Very rude attendant, they refused the refill traditional on all other Mcdonalds restaurants and security was super rude reminding I should leave the parking in 30 minutes (I was in the store for 12 minutes)",0
Rude cashier. Dirty seats and tables. And full of very crazy looking people/drugs (i felt a little bit uncomfortable) The Hot chocolate didn't taste like HC at all.,0
"Asked for refund and the cashier faked the transaction I asked if it completed and she said yes. I did not get the refund.

The sandwich was disrespectful 占쏙",0
"Horrible customer service I have ever seen. There is a staff named LOVE, she has the worst behave with customers ever. She even dont know how to talk. She did nit gave me a ranch",0
Definitely not a great place to eat no refills they charged for it employees wearing air pods  hats to the back restrooms dirty no trying to clean it. Just horrible restaurant,0
"Restaurant dirty trash overflowing and as always at McDonald's you have to demand condiments, bad experience",0
"I ordered a chicken buttermilk combo. Didnt get a drink. And when i tried to explain to the manager what happened, she wouldnt let me speak. Unsatisfactory",0
very bad experience the employee are super rude they have very bad attitude,0
If you can handle the homeless people attacking you then it's awesome.,0
I WAS JUST CASUALLY EATING MY MCNUGGETS AND I LOOK IN THE CORNER AND THIS GUY IS PLAYING HIS PLAYSTATION ON A MONITOR AND THE BOOTH AND THEN I GET UP TO GO PEE AND I COME BACK AND THE JANITOR THREW AWAY THE REST OF MY MCNUGGETS AND ALL OF MY FRIES SO THEN I ORDERED A DIPPED CONE AND IT TOTALLY MELTED ALL OVER ME INSTANTLY!!!!,0
Would have given a 5 but the young black guy asked for my receipt for both orders after I reached for my bag but he never asked anyone else for their receipt and yes I was paying close attention.,0
"The service is mediocre to put it light.. And the cleanliness of this establishment.. Well service blows that out of the water. I hate to be so dark about this, but it truly is gross.",0
Me and my dog went to McDonald's today I could see that they are overcrowded because the food is not that good I was very disappointed and to know that they're overworked breaks my heart cuz they're not feeding the people the way they should and they're not preparing the food properly,0
"High speed good price however the quality lacked a little bit, I would have wanted to wait a little longer ked order for the quality to be better even though it is a fast food restaurant.",0
Very bad service. Do not give receipt. Do not want to refill my soda. Bad management. I will avoid this place. Shame that Mc Donald corporation let this happen.,0
"Have no intentions on downloading your app, but you won't allow me to order online and pick it up a double fail...",0
This McDonald's SUCKS BIG TIME THEY CAN BITE ME,0
Very bad bad bad!!!! I ordered two kids chess burger when I received my order I seated down when my daugher she oped her kids meal she told me her chess burger bite in half.,0
Not too happy with customer service they take sweet time to get you order,0
It practically says its open 24/7 but I just went right now at 4:25 am and its not open. I called and asked what time they open and the lady that answered was really rude. Now I dont have nothing to eat for my lunch. Y'all need to change what hours are you open because its really confusing and annoying going to your store and its not even open.,0
"The management and staff argues with the customers and it's like a prison, and highly prejudiced in quality of service towards fellow brown folks.  It's disgusting.",0
"The employee at the register was so unprofessional, didn't greet didn't say thanks,   like if it was free.. went to get a refill turns out  they don't give any!!!! Restroom was clean..that's about it..",0
"Refused to honor coupons the franchise sold me.
Did not give me the district manager telephone when asked. They lied and gave me a customer complaint telephone number.",0
"Too many homeless ppl, hkt my order wrong workers acted rude.",0
"Too many homeless people! Also, this dinning area is quite filthy!",0
Skip this McDonald's. Never received any terrible service unlike this one. Better off eating street food or dumpster diving.,0
Got my order wrong rude and disrespectful. Worst McDonald's I've bee to,0
Got my order wrong. Didn't make it right. Too many fiends approach diners. This location lost a $30-$80 a week customer today. 5/7/18,0
The problem is with these Mexican cashiers.When they have s Mexican customer they all know each other.So after they order.They chit chat.Even when it busy..plus they get better customer thsn the Whites do.And that to me is discrmmation,0
Awful! awful! Awful!!!  bad service never going back.Girl calling out the numbers was wispering them on purpose so customer wouldnt hear for tbeir orders!,0
"Good location and friendly staff,  but lots of homeless people in and around the restaurant",0
Horrible customer service and they will get your order wrong more often than not. Still horrible customer service 2 mths later.,0
I always have bad experience with drive through. Always missing something from my order,0
The girl taking orders couldn't understand even after I drove up to the window...at the end my order was wrong as usual,0
Not the best one I have been in. Time in line was long and food was wrong. Disgusting bathroom,0
Bad service gave us sparkling water instead of sprite also it takes about 45 minutes to just get a vanila cone and your food,0
Went twice to order a big order of food and both times our food was not ready on time and the large orders were not done correctly. Something was missing on both occassions.,0
"Food ok, not good with kids, dirty and lot of weird and homeles people. Better avoid and try subway next door.",0
"Worst McDonald's I have been to,  Spanish is fine but you must know more than the menu and currency  in English..they looked at me like I was dumb when I tried to explain a problem using words that weren't on the menu",0
I found a hair in my food.,0
"Too many bums, transients, vagabonds, crack heads and beggars flowing through these doors. Very disturbing to say the least. I hope to never return.",0
"My visit was just to get a gift card, and this location is very unorganized. Not clean in the dining room area at all.",0
"BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. THEY LEFT MY FOOD OUTSIDE FOR 10 MIN BEFORE THEY SERVED ME. WHEN THEY WERE ABOUT TO SERVE ME, THEY FINALLY COVERED MY FOOD; BY THE WAY, I WAS WATCHING THEM THE ENTIRE TIME. HORRIBLE SERVICE.",0
Not to much of a fan of the menu but some of the ice coffee drinks are good. This location is always busy and full not the cleanest ether.,0
don't shop here if you like refills on your drinks you'll find out that this is the only McDonald's in the world that doesn't give free refills unfortunately,0
"Unsafe experience.
Lots of homeless people inside and out.A few even smoking weed.
Place was too dirty.",0
Id like drink my coffee with black straw.,0
I had to navigate around some homeless people to go inside. Some of them must have sat in the chairs because the chair I sat in smelled of sweat. I changed to another table and it was dirty. I'll never go back to this McDonald's.,0
"Horrible!!!!.employees with attitude, I ordered one chicken deluxe grilled and medium fries and they tossed the fries to the tray. The whole order was cold too.
Thanks for nothing.!!!!",0
Too many homeless outside and inside the restaurant,0

I had a fly in my mc flurry...and i got yelled at about it ... im sorry.. last i checked the customer was right...,0
"Terrible food, order delivered incomplete.",0
No refills on soda pop?! They also saved money by not giving me my breakfast sausage. Two stars though for having the lights on.,0

"The service took forever, sat in the drive thru for 30minutes and when we finally got our food all the orders were wrong.",0
"Worst McDonald's in santa Monica  ,  every time I order they always get my order wrong and the miss count my exact change just a bunch of special ed kids in there running the place",0
Hotspot for the homeless. Some people were very rude and bothering little kids. This seems routine and manager didn't do anything to remove these people.,0
"They made 3 mistakes on my order, once,  twice, ok but 3, makes me think they are not paying attention",0
Bad service. Rude cashiers. Wanted a number 2 and somehow ended up with 2 cheeseburgers. Very crowded.,0
"Employee have bad attitude.. I used WiFi.i spent my money..to eat good food

"There are too many bums roaming the place without proper covid protection, stay away if you want to live!!",0

"this McDonald's was full of homeless people, and they had a security guard at the door and there was no place to sit because all the homeless people had all the tables.",0
"Mic Rib sucks has to be great, now it's a thin price of who knows what",0
The worst McDonald's ever 6 people got their order before us mind you we only ordered 2large fries and 2 cones yet all the people that ordered after us got the food ahead of us bs,0
Pathetic place. It is so dirty inside. Very poor customer service. First time I had a bad experience in McD,0
"Too many weird people around, the crew it's tough with customers and sometimes the food comes to you cold",0
Food was not good.  Friendly service from team members.,0

Service was more than slow and didnt even get my order right,0
Terrible fries. Only thing i ever order yet they couldnt do it correctly. They had one job! So sad.,0
Cold fries. Property full of bums. One even got aggressive toward me and asked for my French fries.,0
THE LOCATION IS A DRUG DEN RIGHT UNDER THE STAFFS NOSE. SECURITY IS A JOKE. THE CHOPPY ENGLISH OF THE MORNING MCDONALD'S FRONT LINE AND THE SECURITY STAFF LOOK LIKE AGING GANG MEMBERS,0
Seems like they just want u out of there now days,0

Shouldn't be impossible to serve lunch 5 min early,0
All i ordered was a soda and it took half an hour to get one.,0
Real rude manager refused to take my order and was rude to her helper,0
I make this mistake every once in a while.  It is terrify at night with all the homeless.,0
Very very very bad work ethic......all crews need to be replaced,0
"Very small place, the coffee wasn't so good, very crowded",0
Horrible customer service,0
YOU KNOW MCDONALD'S,0
"Soda is not refil and you ask for napkin,  catch up...",0
"My experience visiting this place was not good. It was not because the place that is a nice building with many things to do specially for kids but for the service. This McDonald's offers Pasta and Pizza and I had the terrible idea of order a pizza along with many other things. I have to wait more then an hour and 15 minutes for it.  The place was plenty of tourists many of them in groups like mine and most of them had the same problem. The staff attention was not good. They were overwhelmed and didn't warning about the long waiting time. In some cases one hour and a half. This is considered the largest McDonald's in the World so it is another tourist attraction in the city. They should improve their service, especially in the pizza area. As a positive comment, I received a second ration of one of my orders for free in retribution for the long wait. My recomendation is not to order pizza if you are in a hurry, with a large group and during busy times.",0
Overall great place to just look... just look... The pizza was not the disappointment but the decision in ordering the pizza. If anyone wants to eat nasty pizza I recommend buying frozen pizza. It takes 30 mins to get the pizza upon ordering it. It has no cheese and the toppings were underwhelming. The frozen pizza in your local grocery might be a better option.,0
"Went on a Thursday so it wasn't overwhelmingly busy but still busy enough that there were lines to the kiosks & people wandering to find a cash register employee. Wait time was not bad. Food came in probably 15 mins. We stayed downstairs to receive our trays at the counter, I could see how there would be an issue if you went upstairs to sit & waited for an employee to come find you. The girl who brought our food was very very nice! We received our pastas first even though we ordered the pizza first so I have a feeling it was just sauce pots sitting on warmers to dump quick dishes. Not sure why other comments say their pasta took long. Our pizza came out fine. Really not worth the money but we went for the experience, you get what you get in Orlando... standard happy meal was $8 and pasta meals were $15 for a smallish portion of pasta with a McChicken thrown on top.",0
"If I could give it no stars i would. Me and my family have been coming to Florida for 3yrs straight now and we always wanted to stop here, but it was always packed and we could never get in. So tonight we were fortunate to get in with no traffic and when I say I wish we would've kept going. 1st I would start off with its over crowed inside, very unorganized  and no manager direction. Ordered our food at 9:05pm got our order at 9:30 my niece ordered a Belgian waffle at 9:30 on the dot at 10:00pm it still wasn't ready so I asked very politely bc I'm a very nice person if they had made our order # for the waffle the guy said it wasn't ready, but we stood there watching them make waffles and throw them on the shelf so I asked was 1 of the waffles my order he went to check each ticket and sadly not 1 of them was my the order #. I also witnessed him ask 1 of the workers about it. She was an older woman when I say she was very rude didn't care and walked off as he was asking her so at that point I just wanted a refund. Oh no, but it doesn't stop there got in the car my whole order was cold and the lack of work they put into making food is ridiculous. I do not recommend this place and we will never come here again. My burger was missing a whole top layer of meat, lettuce, cheese and sauce. This is beyond ridiculous I was so exhausted with this place I just took it as a lose and went back to our place of stay. This is the worst McDonald's ever!!!!",0
"We arrived at this large fast-food chain store at 4:00 pm and were surprised.  Bathrooms with no water taps and unused urinals and toilets.  ATM and soda machine out of use.  And to top it off, dozens of unavailable products, especially those made with ice cream.",0
"We were so excited to go here the kids were all excited and we traveled a few hours to get here and it wasn that great. They were out of a lot of food, they had no desserts except for apple pie that all McDonald offer. They advertise chocolate cake and ice cream but when you go there the counter was shut down. The big huge play area was shut down so no kids play area. Also they had an arcade area that was fun but the big prize area where you cash in your t",0
"Growing up in Orlando, I visited this location as a child and knew the Oerther family. Decided to take my child here for her first visit and sadly, was left pretty infuriated.

First, I timed it and it took 25 minutes for us to receive our order. We had to stop and ask an employee what the hold up was. When they finally brought our order out to us, my daughter was missing her drink which you can clearly see on the receipt, is there (Tea & Lemonade). I asked another employee about it, he took my receipt and never came back. So I had to leave my hot food and go stand at the front for a good 5-8 minutes, just to ask a third person for the drink. How hard is it just to give me a cup that I clearly didn receive and I will just make it myself at a machine?

They gave me a card to come back for a free meal and apologized but it was beyond frustrating for a $25 McDonalds meal.

The peanut butter cake was delicious and it looks like the ack in service.",0
"It's a great location if you want to wait 30 minutes for extremely subpar food. Fries are stale, food is bland as hell and in pretty sure there is mold on one of my sandwiches?

Also come here so the kid could burn off energy, but the playplace was closed.

Annnyyyyyways. Probably won't return.",0
"Checked this off my list.

What
I thought id have to check out the biggest play area at a McDonalds.. I actually have lived in Orlando for over 15 years and today was the first time I went. Upon reading some review, I just realized it is the largest... and an actual tourist attraction... I took a toddler her to play and BOY what an experience.

Environment
This is right off a busy intersection, i-Drive and sand lake. The parking can get packed.. The building is huge! You cannot miss it. It is 2 stories and the play area is quite big as well, with an arcade inside. There are 2 stories, you enter the play area on level 2. You order the food downstairs and you can sit upstairs. There are a lot of self ordering machines so it makes ordering go a little faster? Upstairs was VERY HOT! Like there was no AC... and when you walk downstairs it was cool.

Niceness of the staff
Barely had any interactions with the staff. It was ok.

Dollar
They also sell pizza, and that was ok... it starts at $9 and every topping is at least $1

Yes?
Probably not... not really recommended.",0
One of the worst McDonald I퐒e ev,0
"Nope just nope. Stay away. Not worth your sanity at all. First it's packed. So very packed. When I went the game room up stairs with the huge play ground the air wasn't working, half of the games were broken, they are so short staffed there is no employee to redeem your tickets. The play area wasn't well cleaned at all and the bathrooms weren't kept up. I'm sure do to the fact they are so very busy and short staffed. The pizza was good and the peanut butter cake was good. But not worth the hype especially with all the craziness that was going among many other issues.",0
This location fed me raw chicken. I ordered spaghetti with McCrispy and half way through the McCrispy it turns out raw.,0
This McDonald has everything cake pasta pizza and a fish tank and even a specialty breakfast. We ordered waffles and French toast and ham and cheese sandwich. You grab a because this place is super busy and sit down. You can sit and watch the food being made. We saw the food come out and sit and no one grab it employees and managers walk by. Irene went up to a manager and asked how much longer and they said a few more minutes and no one still grabbed it. Finally after 35 minutes one of the same managers who had walked by it several times picked up the meals and tried to serve them to us. We told them that we had watched everything ,0
"We waited 50min for 3 burgers and 4 chicken nuggets !!!  Everything was cold.  I asked for hot food, so they put everything in the trash and I waited another 7min to get my order.  1h00 to have my order in this ""Fast Food"".  No one apologized.  I do not recommend going there if you are in a hurry.  All the tables around us waited at least 40min.",0
"I think I had much higher expectations of this McDonald's because I was strongly suggested to visit.  I expected a 30 foot statue of Ronald McDonald and it ended up being a lackluster 30 foot lighted outline of Ronald on the building.  The picture online of the building made it look like it was made of a French Fry building structure.  It wasn't.  They had a separate drink station where you gave them your drink order (an extra step because no self service ones anywhere).  They had a separate dessert station, and a walk up food counter to order or self-serve kiosks to order from, where they will serve if you eat in (but not the soft drinks).  It is 2 stories.  The 2nd floor is a play area which I expected would be huge (it isn't), and a small arcade area...very small.  The menu showed some items different from other McDonald's but 95% of them showed OUT OF STOCK. So we just ate the kind of food you could eat at a regular McDonald's only it cost MUCH more! All-in-all,very unexciting and not what it should be for being the WORLD'S LARGEST MCDONALD'S! 占쏙",0
"A different McDonald's experience worth trying. We had a good time trying different menu items not found at any other McDonald's. Definitely worth a visit if you're coming to Orlando.

Update: Not the same as it used to be. The selections are limited and not as international as it once was. It lost it's uniqueness and it feels like it's just a regular busy McDonald's now. Not recommended anymore.",0
"The World Largest McDonald turns out to also be the world noisiest. Aside from the fact that 1) our order wasn fully delivered to our table, and 2) our order was wrong, the 2nd floor is a chaotic thrum of children",0
"Don't waste your time or money. We were excited to visit here with out of town guests straight from the airport.
1. Kiosks are backed up with a bunch of people each so no where to stand, wait, or snake through with trays of food. Kiosks were glitchy and blanked out every minute.
2. It is at least 10 degrees warmer upstairs so NOT comfortable at all.
3. Even with our order number on the table no one ever brought food...after 20 minutes, i went down stairs and it was sitting there. Then there is no drink station upstairs so with an already full tray, i had to bring food up and then come down for drinks. So why did i have to pick a flavor if the only deliver an empty?
4. No one to help with service or questions. Lady upstairs spoke no English. I had to raise my hand at the counter after standing there 5 minutes to find my food just to get acknowledged.
5. After all that, found one sandwich missing. Went back again and notified i was missing the cheese steak and staff member walked to the other pasta section where it was sitting by itself.
6. Cheeseburgers were not made to order as requested on the kiosk.
7. Big mac was dry. Worst one ever.

We won't be back.",0
"Today we had the opportunity to go to such a well-known McDonald's, the truth is that the place is very nice, but in terms of the attention and organization it was terrible, half of my order was missing and although I went to tell them that it was wrong, they did not pay attention to me. So many employees so they can't help me in my order. My children were very excited to go to the play place but their air conditioning did not work and it was unbearably hot. They should pay a little attention to those flaws. Thank you",0
"2/5

Drive thru or in person their service is slow during most times of the day.

This is my second visit and I had the same experience.",0
"The first time we visited was at night, and there was a group of male teenagers sitting outside the entrance to the building asking for money in threatening and rude manners. It did not feel safe at all. We did go back a couple of days later for breakfast. The food was very good. The omlets really hit the spot. The service was good. It is advertised as having over 100 arcade games upstairs. There is nowhere near that many, and much of them are broken down and use your credits because there are no signs on them.",0
Unfortunately it's not got any better. The first time visiting this trip and they got my order wrong.... I didnt have much faith to begin with to be honest. The attention to detail here is lacking. And $5 for a latte is unreal.... Tourist trap central. Cross the road to checkers and get good food at a low price,0
"With a 6 year old we visit McDonald's every so often..this place was just awful.

Ordered 20 regular mcnuggets a large fries, couple drinks and a happy meal.

45 min wait - 17 spicy nuggets in the boxes, no sauces despite the machine asking what sauces we want. Drinks are just cups, despite the machine asking what we want - self service downstairs with no instructions on how to get the milkshake we ordered as only soda fountains at the stations etc

Nuggets were over cooked, Like properly crunchy/jerky texture

Fries were literally stone cold, not even warm

Our kid loved the play centre but this isn't worth paying twice the price of a regular McDonald's for just plain terrible food and no service at all",0
"The biggest waste of time and money. Way to packed. Unorganized. There was barely a line when we got to McDonald's yet we still waited over an hour for 2 bacon mcdoubles, a big Mac, a bacon chicken ranch (they forgot the bacon when it's literally IN THE TITLE) and 4 medium fries. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING was cold and disgusting. Spent way more money than it should have been. Will NOT be going back there. The kids didn't even want to play in the play area because they ended up getting hurt. Poorly set up and no security or anything. They were being pushed and shoved by other children and no one was doing anything about it.",0
"Where should I start. Service was exceptional BAD. I was missing half of my order and had to go down stairs and bring the rest of my order they was missing back upstairs which was alot of hassle to do. Also would've been very helpful if there was a refill station upstairs.

The atmosphere, was way too overcrowded. I don't really fault McDonald's for this, but it didn't make the experience pleasant.

Overall I would skip this place if I see a parking lot full of cars.",0
This McDonald is unique in that they have a pasta and pizza bar and an arcade upstairs. Everything was priced higher than at my neighborhood McDonald. I ordered a pasta plate and had a queasy stomac,0
Food wasn too bad for McDonald standards. Atmosphere despite a bit messy it interesting since this is the biggest ,0
"My friend's and I decided to visit the world's largest McDonald's tonight while on our holiday to Orlando. The visit was absolutely abysmal! We got table service which took over 35 minutes to come (3 drinks, a cheese burger and McNuggets) and once we received our order only  of it was there! When we ask staff about the rest of our order they just walked away and were no help at all. So I went to the front desk and had to wait for a further 10 minutes to be seen, I eventually got the rest of the order but by which time the food was now cold. By far the worst experie",0
Worst place to visit. My kids love McDonald so we wanted to try he largest McDonald? This was the worse idea ever. We waited over an hour to get our food. The food was wrong. We ha,0
"Our ""World's Biggest"" McDonald's adventure started with an appetizer...an appetizer consisting of the smile and excitement of my McDonald's loving younger brother. Then came the 1st course...the tears of my girlfriend as she gazed upon her small serving of $12 pasta while her fingers felt the stone cold chill of her fries. Our meal ended with the return of my absolutely revolting Chicken Alfredo which led the the main course of a Big Mac...a Big Mac has never failed me, until today. With the measliest of beef patties and sauce on the side (yes, they missed the burger), I was astonished by the lack of quality this McDonald's provided. Also, my brother's Pizza took an hour to be served and then he was argued with. 1/10 would not recommend, fire everybody.",0
"10/10 not recommended. Waited for our food for over 45 minutes. Didn even receive what we ordered. Parking is a nightmare, not worth it just because they have pizza. You c",0
"Worst McDonalds experience I have had in all my life. Place was chaotic from the moment we walked in but for some reason that didn't put us off. Waited for ages to receive our food and when it did arrive, half of it wasn't there and some of it was cold. Tried to find a helpful member of staff - we're still looking... Went to get some drinks, all of which were 'horrible' as quoted by another customer, even the water tasted like sewage. We ended up leaving with what we had and wondering how long the symptoms of cholera take to set in. So safe to say we wouldn't recommend and would 100% not return. 'Horrible'",0
"Absolute free for all inside. A automated factory that completely doesn work. People waiting over 45 min for their food, nearly every order was wrong, and staff just literally ignoring the countless customers complaining. The manager had no control over his staff who blatantly ignored him to the point he was telling customers their names to report. This place simply doesn work and is utter chaos. $40, almost an hour, and wrong food, with no one to care",0
"Fries were cold, nuggets were soft.., the burgers were gross, the upstairs smelled sweaty and gross, ordered food and the place was busy and my child needed to use the bathroom so I took the card with our number to the bathroom because I didn't want them leaving my food alone at the table and they came over and yelled at us for moving around the mcdonalds.. honestly 1/10 do not recommend. It is not worth it. Go find a  regular McDonald's and a park close by.",0
"This was a horrible experience and a waste of 4 hours and almost $100. The place was terribly overcrowded and dirty. There was standing room only, shoulder to shoulder. We stood in line for 20 minutes at a kiosk to order, then after we ordered it said there was an error and we had to wait another 40 minutes in the line at the register anyway to order. All of the workers were super rude. I was even on the elevator with 2 workers talking about a customer saying ""I have no obligation to answer your questions or do anything for these people"" and then talking about how gross a customer was and saying she would point her out to the other employee. Nobody was at all helpful and even seemed to be angry when we asked for anything.  My daughter tried to fill her cup with sweet tea and the older lady standing at the drink station didnt let her fill it up all the way. The only nice person was the old guy emptying the trash on the 2nd floor. We spent over $60 for my kids to play the arcade games, then they shut and locked the prize counter. A while later, we had to ask someone to open it so they could redeem their tickets and 3 employees tried over the course of the next hour and no one could get it back open. I tried talking to a manager about it, but she gave me about 10 seconds of her time just to tell me there was nothing she could do but send someone up to the ticket counter for us... she didn't even listen to us explain that it others had tried before she just walked away. We are from out of state and my kids were so excited to see this place but we all left miserable. At least the sandwiches were warm (though the fries were soggy).",0
"Over crowded, hard to find a parking spot for it to be the largest McDonald's in the U.S.
over an hour to get a Big Mac meal. Ordered a pizza that came before the big Mac meal. The pizza was very salty yeah I guess that's what you get when ordering pizza at a McDonald's. My kids ordered pasta and were also disappointed.",0
Largest McDonald in the U.S. they are trying to doing so much and doing none of it well. Four  orders and three had missing items. No salt on the room temperature ,0
"We went here on June 6, 2023. We tried a little bit of everything.
Ordered a Philly cheesesteak, pepperoni pizza, kids meal, big Mac meal and 2 mcdoubles.

The wait was absolutely ridiculous and when they brought us the food it was ice cold. We didn't complain because the lines were super long and nobody was around to help. The one guy picked up my daughter's kids meal thought it was trash and I told him and he said he was sorry and walked off.
The arcade was just a mad house. So busy and very dirty so was the restrooms. We don't be going back that's for sure.",0
"We came here all the way from Hungary, excited to try out a 퐎eal?american McDonald. Unfortunately our experience could not have been worse. After over 45 minutes of waiting I got my Big Mac delivered to our table cold, which I honestly would",0
"This McDonald's did not live up to the hype I saw on the internet. It was crowded and small. I entered and all of my expectations dropped. I ordered at the kiosk since the line was long. All of the items I've seen online through social media were either unavailable or not there at all. I saw the ""famous"" pizza and pasta, I tried the pizza. After ordering my food and sweets, I waited at the only table I could find that wasn't already taken. I ordered a small drink so I figured if I had to wait maybe they would at least bring me the cup so I can get a drink, I was wrong. I made a special request for my McFlurry and within minutes of ordering, I was told my special request couldn't be done since they had already made my McFlurry. I thought they would make the ice cream items last so they don't melt while waiting for the food. I didn't order much, and I know there was a line but I received the pizza faster than anything. I waited for a total of 30 minutes for the rest of my food. They waited until everything was done to bring it to me and it wasn't even good. The chicken was dry and looked old, my burger was cold, my McFlurry was made wrong so I didn't eat that and they gave me the wrong slice of cake... very disappointed. The pizza was the only food item that didn't suck entirely. It was very thin but tasted okay. Definitely wouldn't go back ever again. Not worth the trip, or the hype.",0
"We thought it would be cool to visit one of the largest McDonald's in the world.  We regretted it.  The chicken sandwich and pizza were all burnt a little too much.  The ice machines weren't working very well.  The place was a mess and loud for 430 on a Sunday.  The arcade had a few money grabbers where it took your money but no game But the skeeball had a machine that let you play for free.
This place is just crazy and more expensive than my usual trip to McDonald's.  I don't need to try their pizza which isn't bad but not great either.  I would skip this or plan to come to try the pizza only as the price of pizza is fair.",0
My family was dining there and the people that was with us got their food way before us. I waited for an hour before deciding to inquire about mine and my daughters pasta dishes. I stood in line for about ten minutes when a member of management came. They went to look for it. Was just sitting under a heat lamp. We will never step foot in that McDonalds again. We ordered our food at 7:34pm and got our food at 8:45pm Shame on you McDonalds,0
"Used a ice cream cone reward. The machine was broken and asked me if I wanted something else. I said a mango smoothie. They ended up giving me strawberry banana. Furthermore visited again and they never had my order took 30 mins for someone to help. 3rd time didn't print receipt and the customer service was horrible, but the whole time he had the ability to print a duplicate. Stay away if you don't want to deal with them.",0
"I really wanted to looooove this Mc Donalds store since they are the biggest in the world. But being this ""famous"" comes with a price: overcrowded and short staff. People were mad in the line asking for the food, saying they ordered their meal 30 minutes ago. Hello?30 minutes? This is insane. Very tourist location. I just wish the manager would hire more people to work there so they can attend that much of people.",0
"Too crowded, tables were a mess and they took almost 40mins to have our food ready, when we ask for it they weren't too helpful/friendly. The upstairs AC wasnt running or something was wrong it was too hot, overall it just seems like they were understaffed for the amount of people there.",0
"Thoroughly disappointed with our visit. Food took ages and was mediocre at best. The air con didn't work so we were sweltering. Used the arcade, half the machines did not work, had to wait half an hour to get prizes. The staff were rude and unhelpful. I would advise not to bother  visiting.",0
"They have an arcade upstairs but no one working in the arcade, and play area. No one is available to redeem tickets for prizes. Who wants to leave without their prize, not my kid!",0
"Overcrowded and rude employees when we went. Overhyped in my opinion. Just browse the pictures on the internet and call it good.  There no need to visit this place. Smaller jungle gym than we thought and too overcrowded with kids shoving each other and climbing over each other. We wanted to try the pizza but they closed shortly after we arrived. Mind you, it was open when we first arrived but we had to wait in a ridiculously long line only to find out they closed while we were waiting and",0
"Big disappointment. They closed 2nd floor area at 9:30pm so didn't get to see upstairs. Nuggets were smaller and drier than usual, and they forgot half our order but they were nice about it. Oh well, can't expect much in this super touristy area.",0
Had to wait 15 minutes to redeem video game tokens. Long line of people waiting. Ended up leaving. Unacceptable. Do better McDonald's.,0
The building looked good and It had a lot of stuff but the employees didn't even know the food or how it was supposed to be made when they gave us the food we were missing have of the food they gave us a chicken sandwich with no chicken instead they had put a beef patty in it and one of the drinks was messed up in the second floor the air conditioning didn't work it was so hot in there plus employees were just standing there not doing nothing and just ignoring the mess that was there it had poor service I do not recommend very clogged and slow service too,0
"BE CAREFUL WITH THEIR CARS. STEAL if you park it for 5 min. They break the glass because they know that MANY TOURISTS visit it. You will NEVER get your belongings back because not even the police are interested in solving the robbery. ME BEING YOU, I WOULD NEVER GO.",0
half of the stuff on the menu was unavailable & the upstairs was closed.. granted i did visit around 11/12pm. the janitor was moping the same spot for 15 minutes. and my burger patty was hard and a little burnt . I would come back though cause it,0
"If I could give 1/2 a star I would!! My son & I ordered a pizza each. The server brought out 2 but only handed my son his. I commented that we ordered 2, she had 2 on the tray but still walked away telling 1 minute as she walked away w/the other pizza walking around the entire place including going upstairs!! I'm sure they wouldn't put 2 separate customers orders on the same tray. After 10 minutes I went up to the counter to ask where my pizza was as I see a different employee walking past me w/a pizza without a cover!! I turn to see where she was heading & it was to where my son was sitting. I adked her why the cover was off & she couldn't answer!! To top it all off there was hair under one of my pieces of pizz!! Shouldn't employees be wearing hairnets or have their hair tightly up & not hanging down??

I'm very disappointed w/this being my 1st time here.",0
"Absolutely manic busy. The food was usually McDonald's fare, however chips were cold. The place seems really disorganised and half the self service kiosks were out of order (I wondered if this was to help the kitchen keep up). Homeless people coming in and raiding tables with food left. Not a pleasant experience at all and one of the worst McDonald's I have ever visited, needs security guards I feel",0
"Slowest service on planet. Atleast 50+ cars left in last 30 mins while I am waiting on drive thru.
If you can staffed appropriately and efficient folks can make thousands extra without doing anything extra. Just process order with some speed and sense of urgency. Very slow service, I wonder if top management is aware of how slow is the food service in general at McDs. It been 50 mins in drive thru still no luck.
There are only a few unique items on the menu and this i",0
Gets jammed packed with tourist. If you order on the app to pickup in store instead of thru the drive thru and decide to go inside they make you get in line for counter pickup which takes even longer. Parking lot gets full with no place to park. I suggest you go to a different location if you want to order and eat and park All in one place. Terrible experience,0
"I can honestly say this is the world's worst McDonald's I have so far experienced. A 45-minute wait for a very simple and straightforward order. I've eaten in McDonald's all over the world, and the food quality and service let this one down severely. So many people were angry with ridiculous waiting times, wrong orders, crushed food, and items not available. I do not recommend it!",0
Went through the drive through barely said our first item and was told to hold on and she just disappeared for over 5 minutes. We were being honked at by people thinking we were holding up the line. I asked for a flat white (in the UK that's what McDonald's calls a regular white coffee) she very rudely said no you can go to Starbucks for that. When we did receive our order the big Mac's were replaced with basic cheeseburgers. I definitely won't bother next time we are in Orlando.,0
"Very slow service took over an hour, food came out separately so my food was cold by the time the rest arrived. Staff didn't seem to care. Food when it arrived was not as requested but was too exhausted to bother complaining any more.",0
"Just don go, food was really bad even though it a mcDonalds. Tried it out ",0
"Visited today. Play place was out of service. Dine in service was not available. Some of the menu items we wanted were not available Ordered food from the machine, but a staff member said he couldn't find it in the system, started to retype it in the cashier. Our order was customized and the worker made a few mistakes. When I asked what was going on, he started making rude comments and asked if I spoke English.
I asked for the refund, and the worker refunded me $3 less. Then the manager came, and fixed the refund error. The manager was calm, but didn't offer any apology.

The saddest part is - this is a flagship McDonalds location, advertised as the biggest McDonalds in the world with Play Place and Entertainment. I hoped to see exemplary service and atmosphere, but it was a huge disappointment.

I wish next time I visit (if ever) to see working services, friendly and competent staff, and adequate food selection. Peace!",0
The  workers over there aren very smart..I called at 10:20am to ask what time did they stop serving breakfast?he stated that they served breakfast all day over the phone. My reply was okay well what time do you all stop serving breakfast through the drive thru퐃is reply we stopped serving breakfast and then I was abruptly hung up ,0
"Too crowded, wait hours in line for food, just go to a regular McDonald's not worth the wait either. Waste of time in line. Arcade  is also small and not worth it, go to a bigger and better one.",0
"This place was cool. However, with Covid right now no one had control of anything. There was not spaced out seating. People were on top of each other. None of the employees seemed to care that there was no social distancing. I was expecting some type of Covid policy to be in place and there was for staff. But they seemed to care less about the people who visited. I will never be going back here again.",0
"Waited more 45min for my food. I understand when is full, is gonna take longer to prepare the food, but after 40min paased, I asked them about my order and no knew about it and ignored me, I asked another lady, staff mention they already made it.  I don't like to bash but this one was bad service",0
The 폺rispy chicken sandwich?was Terrible dry and hard ! Employees ,0
"Nastiest play land,  games were broke but still took your money,  no employees anywhere to be found in game room.  Couldn't cash out tickets won with no one in game room or at ticket redemption counter.
Pizza was poor quality and over cooked.
Don't be sold on the hype of worlds largest McDonald's.

Stay away",0
"Every time info through the drive thru, I get a snotty kid who doesn even know how to listen correctly to an order. I mean how frustrating is it to get an orde",0
"For this to be the biggest mcdonald's in florida, they were out of a lot of things, the lines were all over the place, the food is more expensive and a couple of the kiosk were down. We ended up leaving without any food and went to another mcdonald's. Lol not what I expected at all. Terrible",0
"Slowest McDonald's I've ever been to and I've been to many! Waiting for almost an hour for your food is NOT fast-food!! The staff didn't care. There were massive queues of very unhappy customers.  Even though it was supposed to be a 24 hour breakfast place, there were no breakfast items available at all.  Some of the food was inedible and/ or cold.  I'll never return to this McDonald's!!",0
"Ok so here's the deal..we sat upstairs...they brought us our food with no cups and no fork, no butter ,and no syrup for babies pancakes and also forgot a bacon bagle...when we told them they said they were out of bagles because it was no lunch refused to make another to correct there mistake rude with a bad attitude...I am talking about 6 min after 11 and we spent 70.00 there...NEVER again we were on vacation...so this is the memory our kids have of the largest McDonalds in the country!!!!",0
"We went to this McDonald and ordered the pasta with ravioli noodles and bolognese sauce,Mind you it was good when I was eating it and when I got home after like 30 mins i starte",0
"Just told there is absolutely nothing on the menu that's gluten free.

Reminds me of when I used to go in restaurants 20 years ago. Very ignorant to a common allergy these days",0
"Busy, dirty, badly organised, expensive, no vegetarian options. They are capitalising on the 'biggest' thing but it is not worth a visit! No vegetarian options. Self service machine not working, no receipts, card machine not working.  I could go on!

Edit, I will go on... the ketchup had run out, the lemonade syrup had run out, the food took over 30 minutes, there was a cup of coffee spilt on the stairs with safety cones that was not cleared up for the hour we were there.",0
"Ordered 2 hamburgers ketchup only in the drive thru.  Had to park and go in the store to take the order back 2 times to get it right...took 30 minutes total and in the process, got attitude.",0
"Worst service ever!
45 mins for a cheese pizza! on a fast food!  My mistake trying out a pizza on a burger place...all hype biggest mcdonald...never gonna go/eat in this location again!!!! And yeah pizza tasted awful...",0
Overheard a lot of uncertainty in the kitchen. And I was knocking on the window for about 2 minutes or more just to get the sauce I ordered. It was completely unresponsive.,0
"I Had A Bad Experience Today, My Family Food Was Late For Around 2 Hours. From 8.20 pm to 10.00. (04/28/22) Maybe Wasn't My Lucky Day. I love This Place, I've been there before and I spent a Nice Time, I don't Know What Happened. Costumer Service Tried To Solve  the Situation But They couldn't, all Costumers Were Angry.. At the end I Had to carry up  my order (incomplete) home....",0

Didn't get my drink, rcv'd a plain patty in a bun when i ordered a qtr pounder with CHEESE meal, no sauce for nuggets despite it being printed on my receipt which sauces I'd ordered. Got a halfa-s effort shamrock mcflurry instead of the shamrock shake I ordered. A manager was rude and yelling at every customer to move out of the way. The employees weren't friendly and ignored my kiosk help request. Just everyone I had to interact with was incredibly grumpy.",0
Not a nice experience at all . Kids were so excited about visiting this branch as its apparently been on You tube but omg Service is Very poor . Staff seem to have been given a sentence of working in here . The food quality is questionable as well . Would not recomend at all,0
It was crazy!!!!!! We waited so long to order.  Cashier had to get manager to change a $50 every time a customer gave to her ( people are on vacation/ families orders cost!!!!). She had to get manager to over ride coupons. Then she left register to help feel orders. Unfortunately people were leaving several saying that's why chic Fila number 1 mcdonalds should hire their trainers,0
"Very nice staff, but the reason I퐉 writing this review with 2 stars is because of the fish tank. They have a fish tank here overcrowded with African cichlids, an aggressive type of fish who will chase each other around, nip at each other and other fish, and sometimes even kill them. They have one Bala shark, which is a very peaceful schooling fish who should be in a group of at LEAST 4 other Bala sharks. (Schooling fish can die from stress in some cases if they are alone.)  He is being nipped at, his fins are torn, and he gets about 16 inches long full grown. There are Plecos that also get about 24 inches long full grown in there too. I didn know who was in charge, I asked but apparently someone comes in to take care of them. I love the staff here! I just want to make sure their fish are being taken care of and happy. It폸nld be very happy in there. :) Keep in mind the rule of fish is every inch of fish (think about how big they will be full grown) should have at least one gallon, if not two gallons of water to swim around in. The cichlids alone get anywhere between 6-8 inches, and I couldn even count how many there is in there. Bala sharks are schooling fish and get about 16-18 inches and Plecos get about 24 inches long, and they get very wide as well. V",0
"Do not come here. It is not worth it. The food never comes out hot or fresh, the employees are extremely rude, and the wait times are extremely long regardless of the time of day.",0
I thought I had experienced a few disorganized McDonald before now. This is a whole new level of bad management. One hour wait time for a normal order plus a pizza. - The employees seem to all be very busy and there are plenty of them too. This leads me to believe management are not equipped to handle a location this size and either needs training or needs ,0
"Totally, not worth it. I've received better service and food at standard McDonald's locations. The prices are ridiculously high for a McDonald's, the people are ghetto, and the facility could have been a lot cleaner.",0
It's a great place if you want to wait an hour for your food,0
"Absolutely horrible McDonald's, the staff were rude and over worked. They didn't help you in any way at all. I waited 30 minutes for a coffee and when I went to ask for the cup to pour my own I got snapped at.",0
"""Hostess"" at the entrance had no desire to be there and wasn't shy about showing it, same went for the cashier. If you're used to Canadian prices... expect to pay almost double that. Crispy chicken had pickles on it and that's it, no sauce or anything... it also tasted like fish. Do not recommend. Beyond disappointing for being an ""attraction"".",0
Be ready for a 45 min to 1.5 hr wait for food.  For McDonald's food??? The line for cancelli ng orders was surprisingly long!,0
"Worst McDonald experience EVER. Waited over an hour for food, which was cold when it finally arrived. Had to go back to the line to get our shake and a sundae.

"The low score is for the Maroon Shirt Manager on 4.3.23 who took the phone off the hook and still allowed the app to sell curbside orders that would never be delivered due to the phone being off the hook. Then, making people sit in the lobby and ignore them while she sat and ""responded to surveys."" Well ma'am  here is one for you, since apparently surveys take president over service.

It took the Blue Shirt Manager realizing nothing was being done up front to get anything done. She realized the Maroon Shirt Manager had the phone off the hook for 4 hours, apologizing, correcting issues, and holding people accountable to get anything going.  To her, I am sorry that this is a low scoring survey. She deserves better than that.",0
"The WORST!! We use drive-thru/curbside pickup because we have busy lives. We퐒e sat at both, for over 25min. When the manager Nathan picked up the phone, he sounded upset because I was calling. He said he would look into my order, because he was currently busy, getting orders",0

It's been that way for years and the other day I went through for the 1st time in 4 years and had the exact same result since I lived in the neighborhood adjacent to this McDonald's. Nothing has changed in 4 years, that has to bad thing right?",0
Still waiting for a good McDonald,0
"I've been to this McDonald's twice now and it's never been faster than 30 minutes. Even with a simple order like fries and a drink.
Ordered mobile and it took over 30 minutes for my order and I watched everyone standing in line to order get ignored for 20 minutes at a time. Which, after reading reviews seems like it is the norm to wait 30 minutes for a single mcgriddle.
After I waited over 30 minutes for my order, they forgot my drinks (which I waited at the counter for another 5 minutes before anyone even asked what I needed) and my order was wrong. But I wasn't about to sit another half hour for them to remake a different sandwich. Not a big deal.
Not the employees fault necessarily... just seems like they're EXTREMELY  understaffed!
Shame on upper management for allowing this to happen. I wouldn't want to work in that environment either.",0

"Mobile ordered food and waiting about 30 minutes before going in and asking. The young man who helped me was very nice but the other man who was working the counter was AWFUL. He called a mans order once and while said man was getting up to go to the counter the worker said 폨h? Not here? This is trash then!?And threw the order away. It had net even been 30 seconds since he called out the order. When the young man who was working on my order stepped away to grab something the man grabbed my bag and asked what it was and why it was sitting there and started to throw it away. Luckily the one helping me stoped him and finished my order. While I understand they were busy but that is no way to act. This is by far the worst experience I퐒e ever had at this location. Thinking it .
But today- I will never order here again and will be in contacting corporate about their behavior. After 40 minutes of waiting I go inside and ask for my food and a refund. They argued with me that I hadn ordered when you can see of the app the exact time my order was placed. My food was sitting on the counter to be taken out. Instead of giving me my food the girl ",0
"Long wait at drive thru despite one car in front of me. 15 minutes to get a fish sandwich and drink. Sandwich was disgusting and wound up throwing it
Out. Staff seemed confused as my order sat on the counter with workers waking past it many times before they finally gave it to me.",0
McDonald's is good comfort food when you need a bite. Still wish they could improve on customer service and adding ketchup to the fries. Disappointing only because it's a multi billion dollar corporation that can't get the simple things right.,0
"There no one in line when I go, and they can even put jelly in my bag as requested. So many regulations to using the mobile app code that it",0
"Working for doordash in that area, and everytime I go to pick up a order.  I wait over 30 minutes atleast.  People are just standing around and doing nothing.  I even asked who the manager is, and the lady pointed to the guy sitting down eating.  This hasn't just happened once, it has happened every time!  I don't like to accept orders from McDonald because of this, but I have to make money.  This place needs to get their stuff in gear.  It's a busy place and not really any competition.",0
"Cannot comprehend why @McDonald's has employees posted in the drive thru lanes taking orders well out of view of the menus. This just frustrates and delays customers for no reason.

If you are trying to be like Chick-fil-A, you're facilities were not built to serve that operating model nor are your employees trained to work that way efficiently.

McDonald's used to be a place to dash into for a fast meal but it's faster to go and dine inside most any other restaurant at this point.

Food was up to standard and only reason I gave  ",0
This is the slowest McDonald's I've ever experienced.  The staff is difficult to deal with and 5 out of 5 times our order is wrong. Great location and clean facilities though.,0
Worst McDonald I퐒e ever been too. The disrespectful teenager that brought my food to my car was slow and never spoke a word ,0
Drive to the next McDonald. This place is robbing people. French fries are ALWAYS old and cold. There will be something missing or wrong with your order 95% of the time. They served me old expired pies. I퐉 convinced there is no management and the owners do not keep track of what going on in their own restaurant. Once they have messed up your order there,0
"There is no way to rate your establishment, very  disheartening due to we were on the road and needed to sit and rest before getting back on, also need to use the restroom. Food was great, but can't really give proper rating cause of this. I enjoy McDonald's, but I getting a bit feed up with the dining closure everywhere. Please do not reply due to pandemic, and safety, due to other establishment being open. I travel a lot on the road and soon will be passing up every McDonald's due to this. I stop because of the Kids. Disheartening once again.",0
"Lobby still closed even though Whataburger and everyone else has opened up.  So, you get to spend 20 to 30 minutes waiting in the drive through line to place an order that half the time they screw up.  Happened again today.  A simple #1 meal with a coke.  Got only the Big Mac and nothing else.  Pointed it out to the lady and handed her the bag back.  She disappeared for few minutes and when she returned with my order, shoved it at me and rudely turned away like it was all my fault.  This is probably the worst run McDonald's in the area.   Don't recommend it at all.",0
"Don't ever try ordering online for pickup here. If you do you had better bring the device you ordered on. They don't care If that's a phone, tablet or desktop computer they expect it to be here before they will ""release"" the food to you. My wife ordered pur food so that she didn't have to relay everyone's orders over the phone to me. Got to the restaurant and they literally wanted me to drive home and get my wife's phone for ""security' reasons. They also took no responsibility saying it's our falt for not being normal and brining the device like everone else and wouldn't offer any solutions. We ended up canceling the order and going to Chick-fil-A who by the way my wife ordered online and they let me pick up without needing the device. I called corporate and they said in this situation the staff at this location should have just asked for the order number and brought me the order.",0
"I have to do this cause I'm upset with McDonald's as a former employee but also a business partner (if you can call Doordash a business partner)

They don't pay enough, so the employee turnover rate is high or they just don't show up, they have seemingly no limits on how many delivery and mobile orders people can place so they get backlogged, swamped, and can't keep up.

I parked, called, told them I had an order and they said to get in the drive thru. By the time I got to the window; they hadn't even started the order. It took 20 minutes in total. I lost money waiting on McDonald's.

Seriously, reformat your business structure. It was embarrassing working here and apologizing for the ineptitude of this company.

Be nice to the employees, it's not their fault. I'm not even sure it's the manager's fault, but they have to tell their higher ups about this.",0
"Horrible experience. First, the person taking order sounded rushed. I barely mention my first item and you just constantly get 폳hat else!... what else!... what else!?before I퐉 even done talking. Second. I asked for my fries to be WELL DONE. I got nasty undercooked fries. Either that or they were old fries. I get to the window and present a coupon for a discount. The guy 퐇ooks?for the numbers instead of just scanning the QR Code, pops his head back out the window and tell me the same total. What happened with the coupon?! Did it not take. Hi",0
It was ok but they didn't bag my happy meals and my nuggets and and no drink holder 3 drinks and a shke so it all feel out in the car and the shake stained my seats but ##it happens right,0
"Very poor service! While on a long road trip we stopped in to get gas and coffee. Upon entering the McDonald's the floors were extremely dirty, but we came after lunch so maybe they had a busy lunch rush. Then when I stepped up to the counter to order, the menu screens were stuck on frozen 2 advertisements. Then I order 2 Caramel Mocha  Coffees. After about 3min of waiting the kid behind the counter tells me the machine broke he needs to get the manager. Come to find out the machine is on auto-clean and it will be 18min before our coffee is ready. Not wanting to wait around they tell me they can give me two regular coffees. When I tell them that regular coffee is 1$ a cup and I was charged 7.58$ for two specialty coffees they offer to make up the difference in food. That's nice and all, but we did not want nor need any food. I ask for just a refund at that point. Mind you this whole ordeal takes almost the 18min for the machine to finish cleaning but by now I just wanted to get out of there. The staff were all very young and seemed very poorly trained. While they were nice and tried to make it right, I think better training of the employees at this location is necessary. While waiting for my refund I watched multiple other customers receive the wrong order or had issues with their food. I dont often go to McDonald's but continued visits with poor service has definitely left a bad impression!",0
"I had revise my earlier review, left underneath this new one.

Just had the most bizarre experience. The lady who took my money at the first window seemed to have a problem with me wanting my change back. She FOLLOWED me to the other window, and started harassing me BETWEEN the barriers meant to stop the spread of Covid 19. Multiple times she stuck her face between the windows to berate me. She asked me what else I was waiting for after I got my drink. As I had just given her my money, she shouldn't be handling my food at all, much less trying to talk to me and knew I had a burger. She then closed the window, and started throwing a coniption that I couldn't hear. The then reopened the windows, stuck her face between the barriers and told me she knew what I had ordered. I told her I didn't understand, and she shoved her face further out and repeated she knew what my order was again, closer and more loudly. I don't get it, I've been here many times and gotten my food without any problems. This young lady not only made the food leave a bad taste in my mouth, but she is exposing people to the potential life threatening virus for no reason. Very very poor attitude and dangerous actions because I wanted my change?

Great, they have really turned things around in the last couple years. The service used to be slow and highly inconsistent. These days, despite all the challenges the restaurant industry has faced they overcame whatever had been stopping them from providing the McDonald's Standard, fast food with correct orders. Not sure if they got new management, training, or equipment, but these guys have brought back the Gold (Arch) Standard. Great job team!",0
"The ice machine was out of ice, had to wait several minutes for my breakfast due to all the online orders waiting in front of me, service was really slow. They obviously have a labor issue at this McDonald's, not enough people working at this location.",0
"I previously had great service with the last McDonald leadership team.  They were prompt and efficient.  This current team lacks the standards of the previous one.  Car lines were backup and missing items ordered in the bag, over 20 minutes for a hot apple pie, unacceptable. I thoug",0
"Normally I would rate this with a 5 star, but lately this location has been having a lot of staff coordination. I just left today and I asked for pancakes with sausages and added bacon to it, but they forgot to add the sausage which by the way normally comes with the order. So I get to work to the surprise that I paid extra for something missing in my order! The place and the food's fine, but the coordination with the employees and the supervisors needs to improve a lot.",0
Online says they open at  6 am but staff showing up late and didn,0
"Been understaffed for over a month. You expect McDonald's to be there for your midnight cravings. I remember a group of people were told that McDonald's was not taking their order due to being understaffed, yet there were 3 people in the back. It only takes 2 people to run things back there. What do you do during the day when you're understaffed? Lose out on the incoming money? If 2 people cant function in the back then you shouldn't be working there to begin with. Simple as that!",0
It always takes forever to get somebody to help you...,0
"Pure trash. Worst experience on multiple occasions. Card swiped and charged twice. Took and act of Congress to get it reversed. Paid at the first window, drove to the second window, and employee says, ""You didn't pay for your food!"" Show the receipt and no apology or remorse, just ""oh?!"" Hands food to me. Last episode, shortchanged $20 of a $100 Bill. GM says next, we checked everything except what was actually take from the register and denies error in the transaction, but say I'll give you a free meal and dessert?! I can't wait to see that location shut down for good. Shame on the franchise owner and the corporation for the service at that location. Filing a police report and BBB complaint.",0
The service is incredibly slow and the staff clearly couldn't care less about customer service. Cashier smelt like a fresh ash tray. Make sure you check your bag before driving off. I know it's fast-food but they could have some standards,0
Consistently inconsistent! 11/7 pre ordered thru the app . No one in line in the drive thru took 20 mins to get my order ! While I watched car after car after car go thru the line . I finally called in and and asked the status  AFTER 20 Mins ...was advised the manager was getting it now . Wait what ???? It was beyond COLD ! $50 of McDonald down the drain . And I ha,0
Do y'all close the dining room at 10pm or 9:52pm?,0
Worst McDonald's ever. Sorry I usually love all McDonald's.,0
Dining room is closed and the drive thru line is always long. Ordering on the app for curbside took over 30 minutes to get our food brought out to us. I would recommend waiting out the drive thru if you must have McDonalds,0
"There were only 3 people ahead of us in the order line.  It took 15 minutes before we could order.  It took another 15 minutes for our food to come.  We were missing parts of our order and everything we ordered was cold.  McDonald's corporate needs to visit this location and review service, cleanliness and food product.5",0
"Ordered their all day breakfast around 9pm after work and had 2 hash browns and a sausage biscuit. The biscuit was so hard that I could not bite through it and I even made a hole in the top when I was just trying to bend it to see if it would move and obviously it was very old. I was inside so I took it back and asked for a new one and  I  even apologized for causing them trouble. I waited about 10 minutes and when they brought what was supposed to be a new one out to me, it was the same one!! It was smashed so they had probably tried to see if I was lying about the texture and smashed it when they saw how hard it was. They had reheated it and gave it back to me with the hole on the top biscion to not do so. Imagine what they are giving you :)",0
"It's McDonald's. I never expect anything to much.
But I do expect the servers to be nice to customers and each other. But sadly that is not true at this location. My server showed no interest or seemed not to care that he has to work.
Sadly this is not the first time I experienced this type of service from this location.

If you want a quick lunch, snack, or dinner. It is worth the drive to go to the Rim location. At least the servers say ""hi"" and are friendly.",0
"Check your order! We live nearby and so it's very convenient. Unfortunately, we can't rely on them getting the order correct, and it's not worth the hassle of going back in and waiting for the thing they forgot. Once we got a Happy Meal with no nuggets, next time it was a combo with no fries, and then a combo with no burger. We're done. Not worth the hassle. This isn't a McDonald's issue- it's just this location!",0
"This location refuses to serve truck drivers.
Tried to walk through the drive thru, but was told that they couldn't serve me if I wasn't in a car.
Sounds like discrimination against oversized vehicles to me.
If they can get sued for burning someone with hot coffee, you better believe ill have a suit filed before Monday.",0
"The McDonald's at Fair Oaks has got to be the slowest location with the rudest people. Seriously, there are two other locations in either direction ( at the Rim and in Boerne) so go to one of those unless you love to wait forever for sub-par, lukewarm food and/or be slapped around with someone's bad attitude.",0
"Tried their new Crispy Chicken sandwich. Came wirh pickles only, no mayo or any other condiments. And the guy on the intercom couldn't talk articultely; i.e. as if he was on drugs or half asleep.",0
Went through the drive-through and at 10:59am was told only serving breakfast and that I'd have to circle back around to the back of the line since lunch doesn't start until 11:00am.,0
"Food tastes gross been eating healthy too long figured I would try them out it has been probably 10 years since I had McDonald's chicken products. It was either old or they figured out how to Nuke girl Chicken in about 30 seconds either way slightly concerning LOL.

this is only a review of the food quality the service at this location seem great and if we could rate businesses categorically then they would have received five stars for customer service and speed",0
"Update  If I could give this location zero stars I would. I have given them multiple chances and every time it just gets worse.  Do not mobile order and expect it to be timely nor correct. Do not expect any friendly customer service here from anyone including the ""managers"". They all need a lesson in management and customer service.",0
Drive thru not hardly. You might as well go in and wait. Placed our order at 1:07 finally came at 1:20. There were 3 cars ahead of us still waiting for their orders. When you are in a hurry pass this one by. At least they are consistent with their slowness. The food wasn't even hot. Tired of giving them chances.,0
"Ordered food at 8:20, got there at 8:30, put my parking number into the app, made sure it was the right location, waited 30 minutes. No food, went in mad because I퐒e been waiting, they tell me that my order was never in the system, I showed them the app showing that it was this location and that the order was placed, I placed an online order yesterday and with th",0
"I used the app to order. They don't make your food until you're actually there, could've just used the drive thru. The food took over 10 mins, yes 10. Then they almost forgot an item. This McDonald's is consistently slow and almost always miss an item in the order but it's the closest one to where I live -unfortunately.",0
The continents glide across the earth faster than the line moves here. Food was good at least,0
"Manager was very rude and unprofessional, staff was disrupted by her disrespect for customers. She was in too much of a rush to speed cars along that i was unable to purchase more food. Bad business practice in my opinion. DT 11:30 am, Thursday June25.",0
"You all need to step up the game. My order is almost always wrong, especially the kids meals for some reason...just like today...I asked for apples and of course didn't get them. Shocker.
Girl at the 1st window in a camo jacket was rude and generally unhappy sounding.
Terrible!!
Update:we ALSO got a toy in the happy meal with a coupon for a ticket to six flags that expired in 2017!",0
This is the 3rd time in a month that we have ordered food from this store and have not received even close to what we have ordered. Would avoid this location at all cost from here on out. Continually going down hill and poor and slow service.,0
"Friday night 10:45 pm. Dining room still closed. There are about 6-7 cars in line behind the person who just ordered when an employee comes out and tells us SORRY, WE STOPPED TAKING ORDERS BECAUSE WE CLOSE AT 11....",0
"Just trash service.... just waited 40 minutes in a drive thru (after paying) just walk in and grab my own food and barely get a im sorry... they tried to bring me the wrong order took my receipt and NEVER came back, I walked in to get my own food.  Absolute worst experience ordering food in a drive thru... NEVER AGAIN",0
Why would you ask me when im ordering if i want any condiment if ur just going to forget them. Fries are raw and my sandwich patty was hard but yet they still some how managed to smush the sandwich in half. Atlest they wore able to get the drink right.,0
This McDonalds is a hot mess.   I live near it and regret coming here every time I do.    Always out of something or a machine is down.     Tonight I sat in the drive through for 15+ min just sitting here watch the drive thru guy freak out over his computer not working...only to be told a machine is out.   Get it together!,0
"Not only does this location routinely forget items we paid for, tonight they served us a RAW burger (and also forgot food!) and I",0
Just had the worst meal. Fries were limp and very cold. Chicken nuggets tasted like cardboard; my kids wouldn't even eat them. The lettuce on my chicken sandwich was unrecognizable and brown. Utterly disgusted doesn't even cover it.,0
The staff was slow getting orders out that were taken in the lobby and they got at least 3 people's orders wrong while I was there waiting for my #2 breakfast combo for literally 15 minutes,0
Fries were cold and I ordered a Large size ($2.80+tax) that was only filled half way. I asked them if they could please fill them up and she literally put just a few more on top and when I stood it up it was just a little over half way now. They wouldn't even pass the edge of the front part. When I showed it to her she got annoyed and closed the window. Very rude employees,0
I get about half a box of fries every time i go. Its really frustrating how stingy they can be with french fries. I order a large and get less than a small. Also I'm very upset with the price changes of already overpriced trash.,0
"Just left,  was hu gry , got home and my quarter pounder is raw !!! The nuggets were old and cold , really?? Had to.just throw out and make a sandwich.  My 6 year old wasn't happy , she wants all week for her nuggets.  She gets a 6 piece and shares the 20bpiece with me.",0
"I no longer will be going to this McDonalds on my commute from San Antonio to Kerrville once or twice a week . I was there today , and this is not the first time its happened, I ordered one thing and receive something not even close to what I ordered. I'm always in a hurry so I forget to check the bag. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich combo and when I finally was able to open the bag and opened the container I had a bacon cheeseburger with onions on it, not happy. Also the tea is never the same its always way too sweet are not sweet at all .  I did call the manager this time because I was fed up, he acted like he didn't even care. I would not recommend this McDonalds.",0
"It doesn't seem to matter what time of the day you go here, it is always going to be a 15-20 minute wait to get your food and that is after you have ordered. It's another 5-10 minutes to wait to order. It seems that they focus solely on the drive-thru versus the counter.",0
"Was not very impressed with this location service was awful 2 people in line ahead of me wife used restroom took my place in line I used the restroom came back waited close to ten more minutes for our order to be taken mind you only three customers we ordered two 20 piece nuggets fry and drinks CHECK YOUR ORDERS HERE!!!!!!! We got a fish sandwich,fry and a big mc ours was not only order messed up they had perfect scores 3for3 wrong then when we dig get the nuggets they were still frozen inside and had to take them back staff just want to draw a paycheck but not do anything and have how dare you attitude when you bring things to their attention never did get my food finally had enough and walked out

I will make this ",0
"When I was there a manager named Franklin was very unhelpful and rude and I wish I could just give him 0 stars!! He was even humiliating his workers. As a person of virtue, I can not allow this to go unnoticed. All other services was ok but it was just the manager who was the problem at this establishment.",0
"Stop! Abort! Do not drive thru! No lie...we got there and there was a line. One car at the speaker another car and then us. Many cars came after us. 25 minutes we got to the speaker. We were trapped in line. By that time one of us went inside, placed our order and came back just after we reached the speaker. We were seriously going to go over the curb, thru the lava rocks and leave when the 3 cars behind us started backing out. Not even exaggerating. There were 7 cars behind us 5 in front of us. Never has a McDonalds been this slow.",0
"I have been here a handful of times as I live in the area, every single time the food is old and cold. Drive to the RIM if you have time. I keep trying again bc the location is convenient but never again...
I will say the servers are very nice but what you",0
I ordered a double quarter pounder with cheese meal the fries were good but I took one bit out of the burger only to discover the patties were not fully cooked,0
Slowest service ever. Didn't realize fast food took 45 minutes. If we weren't stuck in a line we should have exited a long time ago.,0
"Ordered 3 double cheese burger fries combos all were cold,the cheese wasnt even melted Fries were burned and i ordered a 10piece nugget asked for sauce at drive thru and at window when i get home nothing.plus plus i ordered 2 fish Sandwiches also asked no tarter sauce
Cause i cant stand it,they added it on both sandwiches
Usually yall dont fail me but IDK what happen this time.",0
"Super slow. Trouble getting our order right even after repeating it back twice. Order was right, food that came out wasn't.

Once again with McDonald's, if you must eat here the breakfast burritos are your best bet. And Diet Coke. McDonald's does Diet Coke right.",0
"Good like any other McDonalds in the world, but this location like Chic-fil- a here in Abilene  need to do something with the traffic jams they cause!! Franchise owner need to stop by and use the drive thru and feel the Pain!!",0
Food not always fresh. Found a hair in my cheseburger and hardly ever any fresh sweet tea and staff not real friendly. Just this location Ive been to other McDonald's and no problems.,0
"This is the worst establishment I've ever been in. Everyone is scrambling around like they are doing something yet nothing is getting done. Stood at the counter for about 8 minutes and no one took my order, or even acknowledged me for that matter..... HORRIBLE!!!!!",0
"They redesigned the inside and it's Extremely Loud and noisy because the children's area is wide open to the area where adults would be sitting and you can't even hear the TV's it's so loud from the kids I will not be eating inside of this McDonald's ever again! Also, felt PUSHED, to use a Kiosk instead of the 2 girls at the COUNTER, why have ANYBODY UP FRONT IF US AARP PPL can't use their services? Never again!!!",0
Fries not fresh and sandwich was weirdly falling apart. Consistently not a great experience at this drive thru.,0
Drive thru employee was rude yelled at me because i didnt know about rewards app,0
No option for pickup no entering the dining room to order. Think about people who are pulling trailers. There is no way to eat here,0
"2 stars instead of 1 only because it could always be worse... fries, just warm. Double quarter pounder with cheese, just warm tending towards cold and the meat looked really dark, like I would expect a black bean burger to look like - disgusting. The mayonnaise tasted slighty weird too; I thought it might be miracle whip for a second. Shares a fairly nasty restroom in the hallway between McDonald's and Exxon. Over $8 for this junk is terrible.",0
"Just like the rim location, this place has closed early without any posted signs.  This is becoming almost an everyday thing and the 24hrs is not being followed.  Try whataburger or taco cabana across the highway instead.  Very disappointing to see this over and over again.",0
"Ridiculous service, never been so disappointed over food. I asked for a kids meal 4 PC nuggets and I get a box of mayonnaise. I don't know what kind of people they hire, or what their standards are to work at a fast food place but this is not acceptable.",0
"Worst McDonalds!  I've been here before and they have always been slow. Tonight was horrible. Only 5 cars ahead of us in the drive thru didn't seem too bad. Wrong! 35 minutes later we finally got our order and of course, it was wrong. Will not be back!!!",0
Almost bit into this bug! Come on McDonald's really!,0
When you go to McDonald's you are expecting fast and consistent food. Not the case here. My order came out 16 minutes after I ordered and the sandwich was on the wrong bread.,0
This location is ALWAYS slow. My order is constantly wrong. The line takes FOREVER. Avoid and go some place else.,0
"They are always closed ...and no sweet tea after 10pm....and they always say due to maintenance issues....if your having problems just close up.
I won't be back.",0
"I went to McDonald's for only a drink, 3/30/16 @ 9:40 pm and the young guy at the drive thru was a TOTAL JERK. I wasn't even being mean or anything just wanted a drink. In a one minute conversation he was so rude!! I told him what an a** hole he was being and drove away. Another reason why I don't go to McDonald's at I10&Leon Spring!!!",0
"Bad service i know we go in to this pandemic and it is rug times,we need to be aware that there is people traveling and one stop for food be more polite to costumers dont make us fill bad for our food we are working and try to help busyness dont be rude to us",0
"This is, hands down, the slowest McDonald's I have ever been to.  I'm not talking one or two times they e been slow -- every single time I come here.  Glaciers move faster than this service.",0
girl at cash register taking orders did not know how to do anything let alone help customers.. she said next  so I walk up to the register told her what i wanted and she walk off then helped a person that walk up to counter then walk back to the register and said next customer when I was standing right in front of her and never said sorry for at what can I get you.... somebody needs to train better,0
"*** Second Amendment Haters here***

If you value your freedom and right to protect yourself, so elsewhere.  They have sign posted restricting guns

Slow service too.",0
Horrible drive thru service. 27 minutes and counting,0
One hour in drive thru at night ridiculous they said they don't do curb side after 10pm ridiculous then don't make us wait an hour for an order of fries,0
"$3 for a basket of fried that were dry, over cooked, and no salt.  What a waste.  Drive thru and on highway so cannot refund/exchange.",0
Fake food never gets five stars. I'm always ashamed I took my kids to eat here. Great service not great food,0
Either there phone isn working or there employ,0
"Drive thru took 20 minutes, order was wrong  fries tasted like they were reheated. Terrible. Skip this place.",0
"This is the third time i ask for unsweet tea and i get sweet tea.  They even repeat ""unsweet tea"" and have it on the screen as unsweet tea. Folks aren't the brightest crayons in the box .",0
They are very slow and also no dine inn. They also forgot my damn sweet n sour,0
"Worst mcdonalds I have ever been too, waited in line AFTER I ordered for 10 minutes to finally get to the food pickup window  once I finally got there I was asked to pull forward ""cause my food was ready but the frys needed 2 more minutes"" five minutes later i go inside and finally get my meal, that is stone cold.",0
Everything is dirty. Chocolate milk bottles for kids. Cup holders. Everything. Truly gross experience.,0
Workers were not so pleasant to be around and my burger was not fresh... I've worked several fast food jobs I made sure freshness was top priority,0
I'm visiting from Florida and this is the second time try the drive thru and it has been extremely slow. Only for an after school treat.,0
Got my drinks wrong I was 占쏙,0
I waited 24 minutes for cold fries and a lukewarm burger.  I ordered the double swiss large for almost 12$ and I am so disappointed!,0
Got order wrong. After asking for the right order the server got an attitude and took long to get me the food.,0
On multiple occasions they forgot to put ordered items in the bag. After third trip I gave up,0
The food made me sick and even with a rush they couldn't seem to handle getting drink orders correct.,0
The lady didn't do my order correctly an she got upset when I asked for the correct items,0
No reason the lobby should still be closed. Sign said due to customer complaint the lobby was closed. Was given no other explanation other than that. Will not be coming back to this McDonald's,0
Worst McDonald's I've ever been to.,0
Worse McDonald's ive  been too first they get my order wrong make me wait again and still give me the same wrong order,0
Worst McDonald experience. Meat was old and ,0
Order not correct and long wait this visit and other visits in the past. Food cold and fries taste very old .,0
Services sucks and food taste old. Works don't seem to know what they are doing.,0
Very slow  don't go unless you want to kill 45 minutes.  People after me we're getting there food before me. NEVER AGAIN.,0
Too expensive for fast food that isnt very good. Not always fresh.,0

"We made an order to McDonald through Uber eats app, we ordered 2 cactus plant flea market with the collectibles, but they didn sent to us the toys, the only reason why we made this order and when we called to the Madison & Taylor store, the a",0
"Just to preface, I'm not a McDonald's regular so I don't know what the norm is for this location.
I placed a mobile order, and when I came to pick up it disappeared into the backroom chaos.  About 10 minutes go by and there were people overflowing the drivethrough and the indoor registers.  I figured I'd just hang out and just check in every once in a while, since I had nothing pressing to do.
Dozens of orders went through while I was there.  Most of them went through slowly, and a LOT needed substitutions since many products weren't available.  The store's CO2 went down, so they couldn't give out soda.  Bottled drinks were being subbed for soda, shakes being subbed for ice cream, lemonades being subbed for tea.  They were trying with what they had, but what an absolute madhouse...  Listening to the regulars in line, it sounds like this has been common recently.

This exercise of curiosity went on so long (~an hour) that there seemed to be a shift change.  Two of the new employees got together and figured out my mobile order.  Apparently, mobiles don't process automatically and need some kind of manual start by an employee - which didn't happen the previous times I asked.  Because of this, I'm sure that this doesn't reflect in their service metrics at all.

The employee that was able to help me asked first for my order number.  The number she was looking for was supposed to be something like '756' or '1691', like you see on your paper receipts.
However, that number is not actually sent to you via the app nor by email.  That sounds like an oversight with mobile ordering, rather than the local store.
After they figured it out, it took maybe 30 seconds to get my food.  Super weird experience.",0
"Good morning, Please tell me if this matters or if I'm being to sensitive or petty or overly concerned. Maybe because I didn't have my coffee this morning.

I patronize this McDonalds in Oak Park every morning. This morning I forgot my wallet. I asked the Supervisor if I could pay them the less than $5.00 breakfast tomorrow. They said so sorry No. I pleaded with this new manager that I'd never seen before. I asked for the manager that I'd spoken with on several occasions.
She refused to see me, and he stated that her response would be the same!!! I asked him what was to happen to food on the counter in front of us. He said it would be discarded!!!!

Seriously, I asked. So, I said that you'd rather throw it away then let me have it, a faithful customer.....So my lesson is now, Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson. McDonalds doesn't care about my patronizing their establishment and I'm going to seriously break my coffee habit. No more McDonalds from Oak Park on Madison for me.
A lesson well learned, can you believe my feeling was hurt when he said that my breakfast was to be discarded.",0

Please Oak Park government, make panhandling illegal again; most people who do this get in other people's faces and harass them and verbally abuse them. God forbid one of these people pulls a knife or gun on a customer if they say no.

I just stopped at this McDonald for a small Carmel frappe with extra Carmel and a blueberry muffin. There was no cars in the drive thru. The young lady asked if I could please moved to the next window I get there and sat for a little while no one came to the window. I went to the next window there was a woman standing there I said good morning and tried handing her cash. She says we don take money here pointing to the Window behind me and walked away from the window. EXTREMELY RUDE. I said umm excuse me?? Ma폸m? She never came back to the Window. Instead someone by the name of Jasmine Ramirez comes to the window instead and insist that I drive BACK to the first window because the employee w my money. How is it my fault that your employee wasn at the window? When another car approached the drive through Jasmine then asked what did u order?

This used to be the best location for the freshest food but it clearly is not anymore. My nuggets were over done and I had to pour my drink out twice because it either tasted like pure syrup or water and I had to settle for something I didn't want to drink. Also how do you ask the customer what kind of sauce they want and STILL don't put it in the bag and got the nerve to catch an attitude when I ask you for it. I won't be going back to this location.,0
My cheeseburgers from my #7 were not put in the bag and I didn't realize until I got home. And no one answers the phone.,0

"Teach your employees basic math. I'm relying on delivery services because of the COVID outbreak closing everything. Unfortunately that means I'm stuck with what I get. I ordered 3 hashbrowns, and received 1. Did you know, that 3 means there are 2 more hash browns than 1? Amazing fact, isn't it? It's something you should've learned in pre school. On top of that, they gave me no receipt. I have no proof of this. Maybe it's in your computer, but I demand a refund since I can't get one with the delivery app, and maybe pick up the phone as I was calling this McDonald's about this over and over. Thank you.",0
"Management sucks, sent someone home, claimed he wasn't doing anything but he was assisting me with an order. I had two different ordered and got refunds on both. Two thumbs down for Erin",0
It's not what it used to be. There longer waits in line and the service isn't really all that great. They're sometimes understaffed because that people are overworked or not paid enough. However it does serve the local community and passerbuys. So it is good for something.,0

"We waited 20 minutes for our mobile order till we went up to a worker and told her we had a mobile order. She walked away without even saying anything and came right back out with our food which was probably just sitting aside the whole time. The fries are old I even took a picture to show. I understand dine in is closed but at least be consistent with your mobile orders and kindness goes a long way, she needs more training.",0
"I repeated my order numerous time and he repeated. Get to the window and review the order and it was wrong. The employee was debating the order and ask to speak to a manager. And to my findings it was another employee that did the same debate. I ask numerous time if he was supervisor or manager and he said yes. False. Ask for corporate number and dumv found. Was asked to pull forward and they wound bring out my order. Four cars passed and I walked onto the store and a white female dressed in store uniform appeared after a wait period to give me the order. In the car, open order. Fries old and burger burnt. Just sad. The order was trashed.",0
"10+ cars in line, no one taking orders, went to the first window and she said she couldn't take my order to go to the next, the next window had a huge attitude and got smart with me saying she can't take my order either and don't know why the first window told me that. So I asked where I should order and she said ""not here"" and when I asked her again she said to come in the lobby. So I drive around and tried but the doors were locked so I went back to the window again and she took my order, and then I get home to find the crispy chicken sandwich I ordered is just bread, pickles, and sauce. No chicken. Don't even want to waste my time going back. Last time I ordered it I got a spicy mcchicken which is also wrong. Learn the menu, care about your customers. I will not be returning to this location.",0
"I order my food ahead of time online. Only to get there 25 minutes later and it's not even ready. The large fry I ordered was 3/4 of the way full, there was absolutely no ice in my drink, which was a lemonade and tea so it's not like it was cold like the sodas come out of the machine. and they were practically shoving me out the door when I asked for ketchup and salt. By far one of the worst customer service experiences I've had",0
Disgusting I felt a nasty Baby roach In my bag of food This is an outrage. And this place should be shut down. Try to get it resolved by manager. And just complete disbelief Of the manners this woman had.  Infested With roaches sick/// poor service  Disgusting establishment.,0
"There's a reason why there's mainly 5 stars and one star reviews for this McDonald's. I will say about 50% of the time it's good and then the other half is horrible. One time I went before breakfast ended. And place my order. Got to the first window to pay for the order and then when I got to the window to pick up my order they told me they couldn't do breakfast anymore. Another time I went inside around 7pm and despite the door being open and plenty of employees chatting and talking instead of working, they said they were drive-thru only currently. Another time the line wasn't that long but took a good 20 minutes to get through and when I got to the window to pick up my order they had more employees inside talking and chatting. There's been a few times some lady taking the order wasn't friendly and kept rushing orders by asking ""anything else?""  I will say though that the food has almost always been hot and correctly ordered, that is the only good thing about this location.",0
"After decades of serving families, McDonald's is on their way out. I blame it on the district managers not doing their jobs. McDonald's needs individuals who can read, comprehend and speak English. Today I went there for lunch. I ordered #6 Filet-o-Fish sandwich meal. I ended up with 10 peice chicken nuggets. Hmmmm....I  guess the order taker did not know the menu item or understand when I said Filet-o-Fish sandwich. I quickly caught the error and told the cashier. She said, ""So you don't want it?"" Then, the manager came along to find out what the problem was. I  explained and received the sandwich. I left and when I  got home, I found out I  had a frosted breakfast pastry in a ,Filet-o-Fish box! Come on now McD's. May we get better service and expect a lot more from you? If not, please close your doors to save the public from the irritation.",0
"This place is always awfully busy and slow. Not their fault?
But we are very unsatisfied with the treatment received at the drive thru the other day. You don call out your clientele for whatever reason especially not in such a blunt, rude fashion. If Ra",0
Drove up to lane 1 to place order. Waited to be acknowledged. 2 vehicles drove up to lane 2 while I continued to wait and placed their orders before me. I pulled ahead to the window never being acknowledged at drive thru speaker. When I pulled to the window I stated that I was never acknowledged and didn't get to place my order. I was told that I could not place an order at the window and to go back through the drive thru. I chose to go to another location. I submitted a formal complaint about their policy through their app. Be prepared for drive thru customer service inconsistency if you go to this location.,0
Second time I've been to this location and the second time was even worse than the first. The fries were so soggy the box was getting flimsy from the excess oil. I couldn't even eat them. The cashier was complaining about having to refund me my milkshake (because apparently they didn't have milkshakes). My boyfriend ordered a chicken sandwich and the chicken was visibly burnt.,0
My Mc.Nuggets where burnt after a 45 minute wait and i was told to wait in the speaker i recommend going to 1024 E Anderson Ln,0
This was by far the worst experience I've had a McDonalds drive through.  There were only a few cars in line but I waited 30 minutes to get to the order station and another 15 to get to the window to pay and get my food.  I can't imagine what they were doing in there that it took so long.,0
"Consistently the SLOOOWEST McDonalds I have ever seen. Also their prices are higher than all of the other McDonalds in Austin for some reason. To top it off, the food is usually cold and they have a hard time even understanding your order",0
"What can I say, it's McDonalds.  The food is never cold or smashed. It's hit or miss on the type of employee you'll get at the drive through. They either ""don't want to be here and hate the fact that you're making them work"" or they ""smile and make you feel welcomed"". It's close to my office for a quick breakfast or lunch.

I'm editing my last post and changing my rating. I waited in the Drive-Thru for 10 minutes with no one coming on the line. The other line however three cars went through while I sat there. I pulled forward to place my order at the window and I was told that I had to drive back around. The level of unacceptable is insane.  I try to be understanding of fast food workers because I know they deal with ugly people but this takes the cake.  The day is Monday June 11th 2023 at 345pm. The morning crew is a good bunch of workers, however the afternoon crew has always been extremely slow.",0
"Wow, this McDonald's Is the worst ran one that I've been to in Texas. Food is consistently delivered wrong. Your bag is going to always have a missing item. Can we go back in to get your missing items is such a hassle that you just keep on driving home without turning around because it's not going to be with your while",0
"We waited 25 min in the drive thru line to be told we had to come inside for our ""mobile drive thru"" order. The guy in the drive thru insisted we go inside to pick up the order. We parked in front I went inside and waited 8 mins to be asked what my order was. The cashier said she didn't have a order for my code I was giving her. She went over to the drive thru cashier and she told him he needs to process the mobile orders in the drive thru. It was causing a delay with several customers",0
"Terrible. Used to be okay. Come here all the time and have seen its decline. Horrible wait times, order mistakes, always out of lettuce, always out of drinks. Needs new management or more workers.",0
Ordered an unsweetened tea. The person came out to the pickup area and told me they had none and did I want some other drink. I said yes and told her what I would like and it was never brought out to me. I ate what I ordered and they never brought it. I had to go to work so I just had to leave.,0
Absolutely terrible experience! Walked in and ordered our food on the kiosk. After about 5 minutes an employee sticks her head out to say o ice cream? Three of our 4 items were ice cream products. My husband then asks if we could get a refund to which she ,0
If I can give this place ZERO stars I would! I went through drive through and cashier informed me to wait on line 1. So I drove and parked while I was waiting a lot of vehicles passed through. There was an older lady with red hair giving out deliveries of food so I was wondering when my order was going to come out waiting there for 30minutes or Longer. So I walked inside asking for my order and come to find out that my order was given to someone else! So they had to put my order again through the system so I can get my food so again Now I had to wait for others to come out before mine because my order was last in line. Food wasn't warm once I got it and fries had salt when I ordered no salt. Never coming to this place again if your near by this location I recommend going to the McDonald's on 183 by Taco Bell.,0
"horrible experience, just drive for 3 more min to the Anderson lane McDonalds!
I got there at 6:45am and opening time is listed as 5am. I was waiting at the drive through speaker for 10 minutes, NOBODY even said anything. I drive up to the order window and see another car that was there ever since I got here, parked, waiting for food for forever. The payment window was empty. I parked and decided to order inside but the door was locked, even though they were OPEN! the 2 employees inside were just standing there doing nothing, they saw me knock and purposefully completely ignored me.
Maybe they are understaffed but not an excuse to be so disrespectful to a knocking customer and NOT even put up some kind of sign or open the door to a knocking customer to let them know what going on! There were other cars behind me that were just waiting for a 5am opening McDonalds to kindly start working after 7am?!

Went to ONLY purchase cookies.....!  The cookies were stuck together because they stacked them to reheat them. The middle of one cookie is solid as stone.....!!! What a waste of a favorite at this store. I won't be back. To the trash it went. Sad you pride your business off of freshness...NOT TONIGHT!!!! UPSET!!! I went out of my way to get these cookies!!! Today us August 4th 2019 and I gave them another try... Total FAIL AGAIN!!! THE CREW IN BLUE TOLD THAT THE FRESH FRIES I ASKED FOR WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SATURATED WITH GREASE...!!!!! IF SHE STOPS TAKING THE FRIES OUT OF THE FRYER BEFORE IT'S DUE TO END THE FRY PROCESS MAYBE THE WOULDN'T LOOK LIKE THET CAME FROM THE TRASH...SOGGY FRIES!!! I DIDN'T ASK FOR HASHBROWNS I WANTED FRENCH FRIED POTATOES....FRIES!!!! THANK YOU LADIES OF MCDONALDS THAT SERVED ME HORRIBLE FRIES!!!!!!!!,0
Always given the wrong order. Literally always. I ordered a plain cheeseburger and got two spicy mcchickens. Seriously this location sucks. The iced coffee is terrible as well.,0
Horrible service I went inside to get my food I waited 15 minutes just for them to take my order at the register. Once I placed my order here it is 20 minutes later still no food !!! I just asked for my money back ! Horrible,0
I had to go thru the drive thru 2 times due to the chicken sandwich I ordered. It was old and sitting there. I got tired of getting this fixed. Nasty,0

"This is the second time they do this. We are there by 10:27am and breakfast ends at 10:30 and when they ask us what they can help us with we answered with breakfast and they just cut us off and say to give them a minute, they come back around 10:31am and ask us again what we wanted and we told them we wanted breakfast and they say oh sorry we're not serving breakfast anymore we let them know we were there before 10:30 and they told us to wait and all they had to say was they weren't serving breakfast anymore.",0

We went through the drive through and asked for  shakes.  Was told they didn't have Vanilla so we asked for chocolate then they tell us the can't make them. So we asked for a sundae they tell us machine is broken. So get something else. We get up to the window and noticed they have two Mcflurries sitting there . So we complained an asked why they couldn't make them.  This person had no clue and did it anyway.  But his manager which was rude. Said there only doing them for doordash. She needs to learn some manners.,0
"Fire these two employees. I Came in today (3--12-17) through the drive through and I have not so good hearing. I was able to capture their horrible attitude of the manager (picured in white) that claimed ""What?, I told you there is only breakfast"". Trying to make things easier, I asked if the inside was open and I was shouted with a ""yes"". I reversed and parked into one of the empty parking spots. Then me and my 4 other guests walked inside. Took a tremendous amount of time for either one of the employees (Both pictured) to come and assist us as they were just laughing and talking amongst themselves. I was first to order and I was treated with ""I told you there was only breakfast, whomever it was that went through drive through."" I was disgusted with the horrendous treatment I received by the manager (Pictured in white). I'm sorry you hate your job, but that is no way to treat a customer. I was very polite, even though I was very upset about the service. The manager (Pictured in white should be fired) was so rude and acted as if he hated his job. The other employee (Pictured) was very rude as well as she tossed our food into the bag and threw it onto the counter for us to pickup. I was very upset at the horrible service we received. I don't know if it had anything to do with our race, but I did not want to go that route. Corporate please, read this and fire these two employees as they are harming your business  HORRIBLE SERVICE! DO NOT COME HERE UNLESS YOU WANT RUDE AND HORRIBLE SERVICE.",0
No dining in for over two years although the signage on the door still says they're open daily. The app for ordering straight up sucks and only works maybe 60% of the time. Parking lot continuously backed up and blocked from drive thru customers.,0

I've given it many chances but the drive thru takes so long and food is never fresh. I always get hard buns. Not visiting again.,0

Well today I have decided I will never be doing that again, i ordered a coffee and a chicken biscuit on the app and went to my spot in one of the curbside pick up locations. After about 15 minutes of waiting i decided to call, a young gentlemen answered the phone and confirmed that they had my order and it would be out when its ready. I told them it has been almost 20 minutes and to please hurry, another 10 minutes went by and I had to go back to work, I left with-it my food and without my coffee which is really why I went there. Normally id just take the loss but I'm very sad I'm uncaffinated right now.",0
This is hands-down without argument the worse McDonald's in America do not waste your time go somewhere else. Literally just a drive-thru is open and they still have to stop for 10 to 15 minutes to get there s*** back together numerous times have I been in the Drive-Thru and had to wait 30 minutes plus for these stupid MFrs to figure out how to do their job correctly!!! You just need to close down this location and let a fast food company that knows what they're doing take over it!! There is another McDonald's less than three minutes from this McDonald's I highly encourage you to go to that one,0
Go to the McDonald's in Capital plaza because the one off of 290 always has still fries and their food just ain't good. TheyMac rib wasn't even warmed up all the way.. I'll never go to that McDonald's every in my life,0
I was in the first Lane drive-thru and there were more cars on the second lane drive-thru and they got their orders before I got my order placed and it was really bad the service! Finally I was able to go through the lane place my order but they did not have it ready when I got up to the window so I had to wait about 15-20 minutes in the parking lot for my order!,0
"Something is wrong at this location.  Busy or slow, the food does not taste right.  The fries are limp and soaked in grease.   The burgers taste old.  Quality Control is not being done.  Going to give this location time to regroup.",0
"The clerk @290E was the worst. Rather than an 'I'm here to help' aura, she had an 'I could care less/you're bothering me and I will spit in your food' attitude. That's scary! There's another McDonald's 10 minutes away and a Jack in the Box across the street. Thank God for options.",0
If I could give this mcdonald's negative stars I would there whole system is down they act like they don't know that. There is a line all the way on the streets. If your in a hurry to go anywhere don't come here around 3pm cause you would be late. Even inside kiosk is down all 4 of them just crazy. This makes 3 day in a row.,0

bad service and very dirty inside !!,0
"Horrible drive through, takes 15 mins with no cars in the line",0
"This is by far the most unprofessional , location I have ever had the displeasure of visiting. The staff as a whole are lazy and not at all interested in customer or service. French fries taste like they were cooked hours before being served fountain drinks taste like bath water only slightly warmer. Hours are mis-posted on the entrance door and for serving product that is already cooked and just sitting under the heat lamp they are in a league of their own when it comes to the slowness of their service. I will gladly drive twenty miles out of my way to avoid this location in the future.",0

Very bad service. Rude cashier. Bunch of us were  neardy for some Army training so we were allowed  to go pick up food. Consensus ended up being this place and the cashier was rude and with an attitude like she didn't even want to be therre or that we were bothering her. It was at least an order for 30 personnel maybe more. Even one of my buddies was saying excuse to her 5 times and she ignored her and when she finally turned around with that  attitude again just for some sauce. Jeez.

"This McDonalds is pretty hit or miss, mostly miss. I placed an online mobile order, showed up 5 minutes later, and the lady kept me waiting for minutes until she told me they didnt have my order. Didnt even try to accommodate me any other way, she simply just turned me away. Was pretty rude also. They apparently couldn't be bothered to service a PAYING customer.",0
"Nicer now that it's been remodeled but I don't know why they got rid of the kid's play area. I dined in today and my food took a long time. The chicken in my salad was not good, had tough pieces. I ate half and threw the rest out. The manager was super nice with exchanging my son's toy though.",0
"My fries were so nasty and dark brown. The lady I spoke with swears that they were fresh. But I was so out done that she didn't even say ""bring them back and we'll correct the problem because our job is to satisfy the customer."" Or even take my name to replace it on my next visit. But she was very argumentative. Maybe next time it will be better.",0
"I would like to say that I am highly disappointed that this is my 2nd time getting 2 Large sweet teas from this facility, only to arrive at work and find out they taste horrible. This is the convenient location on my way to work and the usual drive thru workers know my vehicle so they normally get it right but when there is someone different at the window, HOW HARD IS IT TO ENTER THE RIGHT ORDER IN THE SCREEN, LARGE SWEET TEAS!!!!! I shouldn't have to hold up the drive thru line to taste the teas each time they give them to me. Then they get an attitude when you ask for your receipt or a manager's name!!!! HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!",0
"Went through drive thru, ordered a quarter pounder meal with out cheese . Was told only had can drinks. Ok, asked for a diet soda, I was told that they only have can drinks and water. Ok, so I said water. Then after I got my receipt and proceeded to next window, I  looked at the receipt , and I was upcharged $.39 for the water. What the heck? So I asked the employee at the window, wht was I uocharged .39 cents for the water. She said "" I don't know, that's all we got"". I  understand that the soda machines are down, but to offer can drinks and water, but uocharge, and not told why, or an employee to make the effort to explain, or even care. Terrible customer service. Disappointed.",0
"I get to the drive though at 11:15pm, I figure since theres not a big line it should not take long and will be back to work on time by 12am... It's currently 12:15am and I can neither go forward or back in the drive though to get out... Thanks for the write up McDs, I understand it's not like it used to be and fast food isn't 5min fast but with an hour I can sit at a restaurant and eat and have time remaining",0
This is one of the worst McD's around. I've only been there twice in maybe a year but both experiences were far less than stellar. For starters the smell coming thru the window was awful. On today's visit  apparently the person in front of me claimed my order and the cashier didn't handle it well. She kept yelling to the front that the lady paid for the wrong order ($3 less- like she didn't notice) and it took her about 5 min to straighten it all out. Skip this one and move on to the next one down the road.,0
"Hated my experience going inside, the cashier was flustered and kept messing up, I paid for a large drink but she hands me a medium cup, they were out of ice on both drink fountains and when the manager was told she already knew.  Then someone said we're not out, they're both broken.  So where's the sign letting the customers know?  And out of all that my fries had no salt on them, now y'all know that's the best part of your trip to Mickey Dee's, eating the hot fries... smh!!!!",0
"As the mother of an employee who is encouraging her to maintain a level of financial responsibility while attending school.

"We are staying at the hotel next door. My husband checks online to make sure the restaurant and dining room are open. They are. He walks over and the doors are locked. Walks back to the hotel, takes his car through the drive through, sits for 10 minutes and receives no service although there were employees in the restaurant. He sees other cars trying to receive service but they are all being ignored. He comes back to the hotel and calls again, at least 6 times, each time it says the number is disconnected even though he had already confirmed they were open through the same number earlier. Finally someone answers the call, he asks if they are open and they said no, he asked them why they answered the phone and were in the restaurant at 1am if it is closed, they said because their job is just to answer the phone. Its clear that the employees wanted to get paid for working all night without serving any customers. My husband used to work in fast food, and I wanted to believe that the stereotypes of McDonalds employees being terrible people and workers to not be true, but this location makes the company look bad. McDonald's should fire the franchise owner, or shut this location down, because they clearly dont know how to hire dependable employees.",0
"Even If you get there first in the drive thru (everyday, only a limited places to eat with my time), maybe 3 to 5 people behind you, order a simple #1 meal you get pushed to the pick up meal area with the same 3 to 5+ waiting for our food. Just and sometimes the people behind you get their food first and they ordered more than you! And by the time I get my food the fries are stale and super salty!
It seems like they are trying to out clear their drive thru numbers to show corporate they are clearing numbers.",0
"The manager and or the Owner does not have business sense. Poor staffing for the late shift. I pulled up to order some french fries at 10:30 and was told it will be a 20 minute wait and to pull to the parking lot. I asked why and the person said ""I have to go to school in the morning"". He said the owner do the hiring and it is not his fault. 1. Bad choice of words. 2. They may need to not be a 24 hour McDonald's 3. Hire appropriate staff.
I was taken back be the unprofessionalism I was handed. And charged $2 for a small order of fries.  SMH. I am glad that my mood was good. However I do not feel sorry for reporting them to the BBB and giving a BAD rating. They need to do better or get better ownership because they McDonald's look bad.",0
Everyone knows what they get at this McDonald's....but come on now.  1st being forced to order from the new kios(not to hard but its slow and takes forever). But numerous people came in after me and ordered from the front cashier and all of the 20 orders got there food before I did.  Normally I wouldn't post something like this.  But ive been to this McDonald's 5 times and this was my best experience yet.,0
Longest Drive Through experience for a couplr dollar menu items. Loved pulling around the front and waiting while watching 3 more cars behind me get orders and go about their day.,0
I've been to this location a few times and everytime I have been the food is always old and the fries taste like they have been sitting for hours. They are always out of sweet tea and coffee and it seems like nobody cares about the quality of food that is being served.,0
Lobby is closed often for seemingly unknown reasons.,0
The customer service is very very bad. I waited there for almost 25 minutes to be served. That's not the first time. I was there like that. So I walked out and I went to the drive-thru. I was in the drive through and out of the drive-thru probably in about 3 minutes. That is the worst manager I have ever seen,0
"Do you want dysentery, cholera, or one of the ""Big-5""? Then eat here, otherwise you would be wise to avoid this McDonalds as if it were the plague. Immediately upon walking through the door I was stunned by an extremely offensive and pungent odor. It was so difficult to focus on much else due to the severity of the smell. This was not a smell of hamburgers or French fries, this was the smell of spilled milk that had soured and marred in the 100+ Texas heat for weeks. Truly, this smell is likely from the repeated spilling of soda at the drink stations that had either been overlooked or merely disregarded by careless employees. Beyond the smell, the sights were just as appalling. There were trays with discarded food and wrappers lining the tables as well as smashed food around the floor. Granted the trays are the result of lazy and inconsiderate people that believe they shouldn't be required to tend to their mess; the employee's should have direction from management to conduct a lobby check at set periods to ensure this doesn't result in customer  dissatisfaction. All this being said, I simply walked into the lobby to order a drink and I would have been on my merry way. I stood at the counter and waited for one of the cashiers to acknowledge that they were ready to take my order. I received numerous glances from, who I assumed was, the front of store worker. I was the only customer in line in the lobby, but understood that there was also a drive through at which customers were present. I waited a bit longer, received additional glances from previously said employees. Still, I was not asked for my order. I was doing nothing that would have given the appearance that I was unready to order. I was not on the phone, not fiddling with my wallet; I was standing quietly, intently looking at multiple employees that dismissed my presence. 4 employees present, 2 managers in the back and zero orders from me. This normally would not have been an issue, I would have waited a bit longer, but the lack of regard for cleanliness and the piercing stench that wafted throughout the lobby forced me to leave. I'm not likely to enter this facility nor purchase any product from this store after today. If the management and workers leave the front of the store in such a state, it forces me to wonder about the areas where customers cannot see. To all those that dare enter, 'ye be warned'.",0
Ice cream was gritty and the fudge they put on my daughters sundae was runny and tasted a little like coffee. We trashed it before we left the parking lot. Better luck next time.,0
This is how they brought me my dipped cones after making me wait for 15 minutes pulled up from the window,0
"The times have gone there they are always super backed up, I try to add something at the window I'm paying and they tell me to go around and go through a big line for a single item after waiting for like 30 mintues. Also when I ask for a frappe they tell me they are not selling them right now just because they don't want to deal with more people waiting. They need to get more people to work of they don't like to keep people waiting.",0
"Awful location. Staff is very rude, food is almost always cold, and if you need to voice anything, you have to go thru the 10 to 15 min wait process all over again in their drive thru.",0
"For this Franchise company to be, how do I put it nicely (in a low-income area) this McDonald was way overpriced, the owner speculated everyone receives unemployment??
Dear Owner
Note to yourself: NOT everyone receives unemployment, and we have jobs. Rethink your prices, and start paying your employees better.
Thank you
Denisia :)",0
"Wow... I mean...wow. Over 5 employees and they all need to work on their people skills. It's just so disappointing on how they attended us. Restrooms were a mess ( it wasn't even packed) and to top it off, one of the employees was eating fries out of the fry tray while preparing orders. I just don't know what else to say other than I will NEVER come back to this location.",0
"Usually McDonald's allows you to pay w Credit card, grab your cup so you can satisfy your thrist if the staff is too busy.  This McDonald's I paid for a meal and went to grab my cup just I like I do 4 days a week and the staff woman yelled at me and accused me stealing despite the proof of payment  in hand... They were  Very ugly, mean and disrespectful.",0
I placed my order on the mobile app this morning and I waited 10 minutes for my order to come out to the curbside and still nothing. I thought this way or ordering is suppose to be faster than waiting in the long line of the drive thru... I finally left since I was already late for work since they took long. I called to find out what was going on and no one will answer the phone.,0
"Waited 10 minutes in front of the register.
They never Acknowledged our presence there..Employees and Manager we're just talking not doing anything.
Then the girl from the drive thru comes and takes our order...I ask who's the Manager on duty, she replies it's the guy in white shirt.
He happens to come to the counter and i told him his service here sucks..
He looks at me and says"" so what, I dont care""
This is coming from the Manager...
When you first walk into this McDonald's it stinks like dirty diapers.
This location always stinks and customer service is very Horrible.
This is the only location close to my work.
Manager and employees are there for a paycheck only...NOT customer service!!!
The Owners should do a surprise visit there..",0
The only thing open is the drive thru. I drive a large truck that will not fit in the drive thru and they will not answer the phone to place an order to pickup. So tried the app they want you to order from and after 20 minutes going through all the questions switching from screen to screen and placing my order then giving them my CC info it tells me that the location is closed I look over at the 15 or so cars going through the drive thru getting their food and decided I really didn't want their food anyways now or in the future,0
"I ordered 9 peoples food ,received only one pack,after immediately I called this location Walmart inside McDonald spoke to one lady or manger I don no who she ,she said want come pickup the food ,I said I can come she said ok we can give refund,she talking very rudely please don c",0
"Slow and rude. The female who took my order had trouble understanding english as I repeatedly had to tell her that I didn't want a drink with my #2. Then it took 20 minutes to get to the window. I was already late for work and sped off after another 5 minutes. I called both the store and corporate to complain. Never got through to either. I'm not going back, to any McDonalds. Ever.",0
"This McDonald's is very low on service . When i first walked there was a smell of something rooting or something else and it just smelled horrible. Everyone that walked i  would seem that . The soda station had trash on it, the tables weren't clean. I also had to wait an extra 10 min for my food but it was already ready but the people were just standing around not calling out my order.i had to go up to them and say is that my order and the guy said i don't know.",0
"Sat at one of the drive thru station for 5 minutes without anyone asking for our order. Saw the other order station was taking orders. Went inside and couldn get anyone attention to ask about it maybe being broken, they have ",0
Service real slow.   It appears that the Manager and a staff showed the customer's there open dis agreement.  Staff was loud Managet was the same.  You take all disagreement to the back not on front.  Seems like a racial disagreement. Time: 2:30pm...Not Good on the manager part.,0
"This Place is Horrible, The Manager JOSUE is absolutely the worst person you퐇l ever meet. The Employees are treated wrong and he always uses a scapegoat to deal with problems. I don see why he became manager. Apart from that, the Place is filthy, the dr",0
"The kiosks suck. People can figure out how to use them, so you have to wait. If you can get someone at the register, they act put out. I managed to skip the kiosk, and had to wait longer than the people that took forever figuring out the kiosks. Been here 10 minutes and s",0
"I can't tell you how much I have the new kiosk system of ordering. The employees couldn't care less if you have ordered or need to order, and that goes for the managers also. Everyone is only worried about what the lazy people in the drive-through are ordering. And to make matters worse, if you want to pay with cash, you get to order twice. What a stupid idea, why not just give me a place to do all the work myself like Fuddruckers.",0
"I love how on their door they say the drive thru is open till 12am, however between 11:30pm-11:35pm I sat there waiting for someone to respond to me at the speakerbox. I didn't know they had closed their drive thru window early until a customer who was leaving let me know. But I'm not the type to critique without leaving advice so here's some for free.

This is like 300IQ so get ready. You get a piece of paper and write something to the effect of ""drive thru closed"" and tape it to the drive thru speakerbox. This will effectively let everyone except blind drivers know that no one in the store will be taking your order. For blind drivers (and other drivers) you can just use the speakerbox to let them know!",0
It was all good until me and a couple of friends came into the lobby and a gentleman who looked to be Hispanic with dark hair and a dark beard was complaining to a manager about how he has already cleaned the lobby twice and doesn wanna clean it a third time (assuming we were the problem)(not to mention other comments that were made about us coming in) and I thought that was very uncool. I get coming in late but this place is 24 ,0
Line moved ridiculously slow tonight and food wasn't hot.  Not always the case but that was my experience tonight.,0
Came here at 10pm and this is how I got my meal,0
Dirty dining room. Beverage station needed to be wiped down.  Trash cans were overflowing.  Roaches. Floors needed cleaning. And no. They were not too busy to clean. We were their only customers other than the 1 car at the drive thru and we saw at least 6 employees.,0
My food was overcooked. The lettuce they put on my hot & spicy was brown and it looked like it needed to thrown away. I waited almost twenty minutes for a six dollar meal. Their fountain drink machine needs to be fixed. The orange hi-c is just orange syrup and the sprite taste like carbonated water. I wont be going back there!,0
"Went to this location this morning around 4:30am, tried to order at drive thru, was told I had to come in, once I went in, cash registers didn't work & they would only except cash which is not unusual because I've come to this location several times during the AM hours & they will only except cash seems like all the time but after I FINALLY got my order this morning was pissed to find that my hash brown was hard as a rock. WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO THIS LOCATION EVER AGAIN.",0
"This McDonald's is getting this rating not cause its McDonald's, but because time after time, it has been terribly poor service. I have had one experience where a manager told me that I was wrong. That clearly I ordered wrong. All I asked for was a double quarter pounder with cheese meal. They took down a quarter pounder with cheese meal because that's likely more common than what I ordered. And instead of admitting they may have messed up, she told me I was wrong and needed to just accept that. I have been told that they only carry 2 types of sauce for nuggets as well, which I believe isnt true. I believe they just didnt know the other ones and didnt want to find out. I have also had large fries consistently only filled about 3/4's of the way. Never once have I had a full large fries from there.",0
"Breafast burritos tortillas are always hard and eggs are dried out when I go late in the morning.  So I ask for extra cheese. Cashier says they cannot do that because they are already made. I tell her make me 2 fresh ones. She says she has to ""go see""  Comes back and says no.  I order something elsr and aak for fries. It is only 10:15 and we cant make fries until 10:30.  I can get hash browns at 3:00 pm but cant get fries until after 10:30?? Makes no sense. I ask for manager. She says ""I am the manager""  Really? Then why did you have to go ask about the cheese?  Do you always ASK your emoyees if tthey can put cheese on sonething?  So now she not only gives bad service...but LIES to me about being manager!  I want call from OWNER",0
"Everytime I go here they seem to have an issue with charging for ranch. Today a told them at the speaker box twice I wanted a total of 3 ranch. Which honestly, I could use five or six. When I got to the second window I only found one. It was a manger serving me. I explained to her that I asked for a total of 3 ranches. She hands me 1 and proceeds to tell me I was not charged for it. Annoyed I grab the change and explained to her I ask for extra everytime and it ends up like this. At this point the manager quickly grabbed 2 more and rushed me off. I understand I was not charge, I am willing to pay the extra dollar or 2 for extra. Please dont be rude to me cause I like enough sauce for my nuggets.",0
"The place sucked. The manager forced us to used the ""self order kiosk"" which I hate using. If I have to take my own order, give me an employee discount. Then a girl behind the counter told me their coffee machine was down then offered me a cup of regular coffee I'm place of the ""McCafe"" I ordered for $4. Then I ordered 2 apple pies and found cherry pies in the apple pie box. I was the told they only had 1 apple pie left. Instead of offering a refund, I was asked ""if"" I wanted one. I was given the incorrect amount back for my refund.  It was the worst ""Mcspirience"". I ever had.",0
"Was told to wait on the side of the building which is typical when long lines form in the drive thru. These guys didn't have the courtesy to bring me my food. I had to wait outside in the heat for 15 minutes before I got fed up to go inside and have one of them say ""It's been ready"".  Worst customer service I've ever received at ANY McDonalds. Way to be terrible!",0
"Bad customer service, drive thru won even listen to ya told them I had coupon on my phone said yes, and then charged me full price ? Inside is ghetto not very good hiring staff obviously, I was there when they had to call the police on one of the employees who was sitting there yelling slurs inside. This place sucks overall crappy food anyways eat somewhere healthier and classier with better customer service I suggest... a",0
I guess my expectations should be low. Inside smelled like $#!T somehow. Management and staff were having loud personal conversations that included cuss words. Talking about how they were so ready to go home cant deal with this bs. Among other things. One manager was on her phone while tending to fries. Cashier was soft spoken and rude or clueless. Gnats flew around my food as I ate. I was given my ice by the cashier from a bucket behind the register. There were no ketchup or napkins out for self serve so when I asked for them they were thrown on my tray. It is McDongles after all.,0
Every time I go to this McDonald my order is always missing something. ,0
"Went there Sunday night, shortly after dark, ordered 2 fish sandwich, Sprite, n 10 piece chicken nugget meal, the fish sandwich were the worst I've ever had the fish was Really small n over cook, and the nuggets were small n cold, n I swear the drive thru cashier was stoned I'm never going there again sorry guys I love Mc Donald",0
Nice place clean but got 2 stars.. Always during lunch it gets packed and they have a way to order your food yourself now me being me I would help out bit when it's always asked in a rude way to order your meal back there I cannot accept. They need more help there obviously.. Sorry McDonalds but needs to change there tactics on time management and other stuff aside from that a gentleman behind me did not get to order because he didnt place his order by himself but neither did i.. No bueno.,0
"I went at 6am and I understand not everyone is  a morning person, but geez...she kept cutting me off and was very short with me and I was in a great mood, but sadly her attitude got to me and ruined my morning. Disappointed with morning staff or at least this lady individually.",0
this is the absolute worst customer service I've ever experienced. I was at the drive-thru for at least 3 minutes and nobody ever responded on the intercom box and then when I pulled up to the window the lady said it was working that they just didn't take my order,0
"Sign says lobby open till 11pm and the doors locked at 10 pm. Called to ask manager about descrency of hours of operation and was not satisfied with response from manager and when i asked for corporate or complaint number, she responded ""why did i need the number"".  Really?? For being new in this area, extremely dissappointed,  Terrible customer service, horrible quality and have had complications at this location 290 at tuscany austin tx.",0
"I been looking forward to visiting a high tech Macdonald and to my surprised was the dirtiest Macdonalds I been in. Bathrooms were filthy and the main dinning area needs a thorough cleanup. Seen third world countries Macdonald and always been spotless.

I would not record this location, I mentioned it to an employee and she mumble as she walk away.",0
"Talk about HORRIBLE SERVICE this is by far the worse place to try to go at any time of the day, you have nothing but RUDE EMPLOYEES. Definitely a lesson learned I have had quite a few BAD EXPERIENCES going to this mcdonals. NEVER AGAIN! I rather drive an extra 10-15 minutes and take my money and my business somewhere else.
(If I could give this review a 0 start I would)
I AM HIGHLY DISSATISFIED WITH THIS PLACE!",0
"Usually I don't have time to eat at McDonalds. So I take food to-go. This is not the first time that I order something and I get something. These people always miss something from the order and since its to-go, I can't even go back and tell them. It happened like 5-6th so far. Very poor service from this McD.

Hopefully they read this and do something about it.",0
"Over cooked chicken, over salted fries, wrong drinks.",0
"Unpleasantly warm inside (it's a warm day in December), the men's bathroom was disgusting. They couldn't sell me a hot fudge sundae because they were out of fudge. On the positive side, my hamburger met expectations.",0
Probably the worst McDondalds I have visited on a regular basis in my life. Rude employees that don't care and something is ALWAYS wrong with my order.  And for some reason the debit card reader is always down.,0
"This location has gone downhill. It saying 24 hours, but they always say it closed. If you",0
"Says they're open 24/7 but I've shown up 5 times in the past month past midnight and there was no one answering the drive thru. Dont eat here they will mess up your order as well, I have to go back to get my order right every 2/3 times",0
There was no one men the drive through i came back three times. I love McDonald's I have been going there since i was very young. I hope things change for the better at this location.,0
"I wish I could give 0 stars....my order was completely wrong, I had no eggs,  my biscuits were literally burnt, the coffee was disgusting and when you try to call the phone is off the hook and just goes busy when you call. They even repeated my order back to me and it was correct on the receipt, but I did not rcv what was listed",0
"This McDonalds is consistently out of coffee.  I have gone there several times in the morning and they are out.  Personally I have always liked McDonald's coffee, it is too bad this franchise cannot provide it.",0
"Well where do I start 1 Lack of Supervision always good to see our youth learning to be in the work force but more playing and joking around than waiting on the customer.  2 most McDonald's fries are the Bomb not here there over Cooked along with everything else. 3 place always empty napkins,  straws, ice .4 place is Filthy unless you get there early in the morning.  Good Luck if you go there.",0
Sick of the long wait. Every single time I come here it's the same woman running the register. 10 minutes to order food. 10 minutes to get my food. Get a crew that actually works. Or get an ow we that actually values CUSTOMER SERVICE.,0
I went through the Drive-Thur everyone was on there phones which is beyond discussing when you퐎e dealing with food. Before I could even get t,0
"If I could give it 0 stars, I would. Place is dirty, staff are rude. I don't think this is a good place anymore. It took ten minutes to take my order and ten minutes for my food to come out. This isn't fast food! The vibe in the air is like we're in a Funeral Home. Never eat here!",0
"Drive thru is super slow, and curb side isn't available in the evenings. Buns can also be stale at times",0
"Went here a few days ago around 10pm to get some food. Guess what the person at the drive-thru told me?

""I'm sorry but we're out of burgers""

We truly are in endtimes folks. Brace yourselves.",0
Slowest McDonalds I퐒e dealt with - 20 min for Big Mac ,0
"So no one answered. The guy who took my order was very rude, they had me waiting in the first window like about 15 minutes, I knocked at the window and no one would ever come out. Other 5 cars were behind me, waiting. VERY SLOW AND BAD SERVICE. If you",0
"this is the worst place ever, i guess the qualification to work here is rude. every single person that works here is RUDE- the order is NEVER right, and again they are RUDE, like you choose to work here so why be rude be the best you can be at McDonalds. the inside is always dirty i will never eat here again",0
"Extremely slow service. Staff unorganized and rude. No gravy for mashed potatoes and they were old and cold, macaroni overcooked. Truly worst experience ever. Not worth the e tra effort made to drive there and wait for fresh chicken.",0
Very slow service. People are not professionals and more inside talk than work. The management should look into the working staff. It took me 20 min although order was placed 15 min before I reached.,0
"Showed up at 5 am and was sitting in the drive thru for about 5 minutes. Called the store and asked if the store was opened and was told either 5 or 5:30 they would open, and that she wasn sure w",0
Not open 24hrs all lights are on and drive-thru is open. I was waiting for over 5 minutes then decided to pull up to the window. Employees are in there but not serving. Please change hours of operation and turn drive-thru lights off!!!,0
Rolling eyes and aggressive teenagers at the drive thru when I visited at 8:15pm on 10/25,0
"Employees loud and arguing with each young guy cussing, cashier asked a other employee if was special ed. Then told drive thur  girl learn english. Got my order wrong this and the past few time",0
"I'm not a big fan of mcdonalds at all but for the first time in forever, I came to a mcdonalds cause my friend wanted to get quick food. When I asked for some extra sauce, the manger was kinda rude about telling me how it cost extra. Then my friend orders 1 regular mcChicken sandwiche. The gave her a hot new spicy sandwich. 3 tries later, they keep giving us a spicy instead of regular. I am really disappointed as well as my friends were. This is why I don't come to mcdonalds.",0
Worst mcd's I've been to. Come here twice and both times horrible experiences. Don't know if it's McDonald's standards to hire employees that don't know basic math or how to read. They have a screen and a receipt but they still mess up on how many meals the I order. I will never come back to this place ever again.,0
"I've eaten McDonald's EVERYDAY for lunch for over 2 years (I know it's unhealthy, but that's not what were here for) and due to my employment, I've eaten at many MANY McDonald's all over Austin and surrounding cities and this location has by far the worst staff of any McDonald's in the greater Austin area",0
This is not a good mcds to go to first I ordered big breakfast and they had no scrabble egg then I order a frappe and the machine doesn't work then I get to window and pay and they didn't have my order right had to wait not only waiting I get home. Em pancakes are all stuck together couldn't even put butter on then cuz they rip when you would take apart they gave me my platters all the food lop sided cause they didn't have big bags and then sausage was burned hard egg looks like it had been sitting there some of it looked green then I call them and no one answers the phone not right at all don't recommend it,0
This location is not 24 hours. Went to the window around 11pm said they were closed and to order with the app. Of course they never have any of the frozen frozen drinks.,0
"Service is slow, sometimes they run out of drinks or can't make frappes.",0
They never get the orders right they never give you your receipt. I ordered a coffee and the sign said it was a dollar they told me it was no longer a sale but the sign was still there I had to pay like a dollar 79 for the sign to say a dollar coffee I thought they would honor it but they didn't the service is very slow.,0
"1 star because workers apparently don't know items on their menu, then give you attitude because they don't know it? I almost laughed at how unprofessional that was, felt like I was giving my order to a 8yr old. But no it was a full grown lady, ridiculous haha",0
"This McDonald's is like almost all others they not that good like most parents just went there because the kids wanted to play. The play place is outdated, its outside, dirty and hot. The food is like all McDonald's not that good but they do have two ipads on two tables with games ",0
"I ordered a filet-o-fish, which I order everytime I get s meal at McDonalds. The fish was WAY over cooked and greasy. It didn't even look like a piece of fish! The fries were almost burned ....not at all like McDonalds normally cooks them. I told them I was not eating fish that looked like that...and to give me something else. They gave me a Quarter Pounder and new fries (which were still over cooked). The Quarter Pounder was the worst I've ever eaten...very greasy! I will never visit this location again!",0
Park is very worn down with minimal area for kids. Bathrooms are messy and unkempt. However the food is still good and as expected just that it can be extremely dirty at points,0
The workers were too busy standing and talking instead of coming to pick up the receipts from  the customers to pay for their meal. It was jus not right. Had to wait almost an hour for the food. It was very poor,0
Been here 4 separate times at night and no one takes orders or even acts like they are open. It says 24 hours but after 1am they stop serving customers. This place sucks,0
Had to give a star to do a review but this place right here is a mess. It really seems like they people working the drive thru like conflicts or drama which is some str8 bullshiii I tell ya. I don't like coming or going to this one especially if it's the one on Airport ugh,0
"The lady that works on wensday,thursday and friday morning at 5 is very rude..Its like we r bothering her when we place a order through drivethru...",0
This was the saddest McDonald's. Everything was poor even the bathroom. Had no tissue. The manager said they were out. So this male maintenance guy gave me a big hand full of napkins and said sorry. Wow ..,0
I was picking up a door dash order and the drive thru guy was eating fries with no gloves and no mask plus he gave me the order with out washing his hand that where oily from the fries he was eating feel sorry for the people eating at this location smh,0
One minute after closing. 1:01AM... Sorry bro I already turned off all the machines. COVID=NO MORE CUSTOMER SERVICE,0
"I came with my family to enjoy a dinner.
People working at 7PM on 10-04-19 were discussing and talking very loud.
This is unacceptable.",0
"Don come here, it says 24 hours but it not. I saw three cars in ",0
"It's a McDonald's, not the cleanest one but not the grossest. Service inside the restaurant is terrible, they seem to only focus on the drive through, so don't go in.

Edit: service here is in constant decline, avoid at all costs.",0
"This location always has a problem the staff is rude. They never have ice cream   or frappe's, hot chocolate and they take forever to give you your order and they also make it wrong and honestly why do you have to ask for ketchup if I get fries i want ketchup.",0
"This McDonald's is NOT open 24 hours. Just went to the drive-thru and there were signs on the drive-thru speakers that said Close"".  This is not the first time this location has been closed when I have gone by to get something to eat.  So, not only were they closed for business, but the sign was misspelled. Very disappointed.",0
"I come here late night bc Google says it open 24hrs. Anytime I come here past midnight, no one answers",0
"Drive thru was open at 11:00 pm, but didn't get served. Voice on speaker rudely said ""we're closed"". Lots of cars weren't served.",0
Very sad. Explained that the food was saturated with grease and employees were uncaring and unable to make it right or didn't care. A simple fix  was too much trouble,0
Great cooks here. But this building is filthy . Gross. And the servers are always unhappy.  I have to drive out of my way to get a better experience for my money.,0
says it 24 hours people are there but never answer the window. this is not a 24 hours not sure when theybcose but I was here at 10:45 PM on a Tuesday and noone answered the drive thru and when I went around I saw people in there,0
Patties were raw and uncooked took 20 minutes to get ahold of someone then get told to call back later. Threw the burger away and made ramen instead!,0
"Would NOT break my $100 bill because my order was only $6.48 . . . i call it LAZY to satify the CUSTOMER !
They really need to have ""Pep talks"" in the mornings b4 they open & remind their stsff that ""THE CUSTOMRR IS ALWAYS RIGHT"" !!!",0
"Was looking at menu to see what I wanted, and was told in loud voice I cannot order there, use the kiosk.
I stated I was looking to see what I want then use kiosk.
I was then screamed at and told to go to the kiosk.

They took so long getting my uber order ready (two medium meals) that my uber driver started having HIS lunch while waiting for my order.,0
They have super slow service and only offer drive thru.,0
Terrible. The service is always slow at this location. I go to McDonald's at least 3 times a week. Elgin manor austin. This location not so often and every time I go I remember why I don't go toooooo slow. Everytime!!!,0
"Anyplace that makes you park when going thru drive thru always will deserve 1 star in my opinion, if I wanted to wait in the parking lot I would of paid thru curbside more angry watching cars that ordered after me get their food first",0

"It says open 24hours online and on the sign they have, I was just there and no one answered when I pulled up on the drive thru. There was a lady inside when I pulled up to the window and she just ignored me and pretended she didn",0
It would be best if the person taking my order could understand me that way they could actually give me what I ordered,0
I ALWAYS have an issue with this location! And this time THEY OVERCHARGED ME! They didn't even have the LARGE CARAMEL MOCHA I ORDERED!!!,0

Your employee is hiding in the restaraunt not responding to customers trying to order food at the drive through. This location says  dining and drive through are open 24/7.,0

"This McDonald's is okay in somewhat not words, but it never has ice cream. And looks like this McDonald's does nothing to this situation on it having or fixing the machine, I have come to this McDonald's for almost 2 years and there has never been ice cream, at least not when I am there",0
"They got half of our order wrong, there was attitude when requesting additional dipping sauce, and the tea tasted moldy. Very disappointing.",0
Probably the worst McDondalds I have felt with on a consistent basis in my life. Management is rude employees don't care and something is ALWAYS wrong with my order.,0
"Door states the location is 24 hours. 3 days this last month I get no answer on drive thru  window.  12am, 2am, 4am",0
Never go here!,0
Horrible service. Lady says she doesn't run registers and told me I need to order food on kiosks myself. Navigation for food was slow wasted more time than I should of. Dine in service was rude.,0
This particular day service was very slow. Took eleven minutes to get my order and another customer asked for their money back.,0

"Ewwww I'm here now, and there is rat poop everywhere! This is nasty and I can't believe this place is open. I would tell them how nasty but they don't speak much English and it took me 5 minutes just to acknowledge me at the counter---even tho there is only one other person here. Gross!!!!",0
Don't ever go here after 2am. They always have system issues. So you'll need cash and park somewhere until they eventually get to your order.,0
They mess up my order alot and employee's act like its my fault. That and after midnight they don't want to take your credit card. Always claiming the system is down.,0
1 hour wait drive through and the food is bad,0

Avoid at all costs. Poorly designed driveway. Employees mess up order 5 out of 5 times. Sent back a kids plain ketchup and cheese burger 4 times because they kept  sending out everything but what we ordered: cheeseburger with ketchup only.

The worse McDonald in LA. Unprofessional stuff and very unknowable manager regards to health and food handling basics. After realizing that the person who was working at the fries station didn used gloves at all and he was sticking his finger into each box he needed to fill and touched each fries in a way that is improper and already contaminated.

"My order is WRONG every time; the most frustrating customer experience. I live near this new location and have visited 6 times since the remodel, and I've concluded that this location is a 120% mess. If all of my orders are wrong I can imagine thousands of others are driving off with incorrect purchases. I ask for no cheese every time, and guess what is in my order.. CHEESE. Or my frys are half full, or the hashbrowns are completely missing, no syrup/ utensils are in the bag as requested. On 3 occasions we were told to pull ahead and park on the side while they remake my order, an employee brings out an incorrect order.. yes 3 times. Today this ""New"" team member blatantly tells me to go in and take of it... what the hell? Every other time I let the incorrect order slide, but today I decided to speak with the store manager. I let her know politely about all of my incorrect orders, and she replies ""Sorry"", I then ask ""what is mcdonalds doing about this, its every time the order is wrong?"" She responds ""I'm so sorry""... I ask again and same response.  Meanwhile the woman next to me is asking about the replacement order that she put in ten minutes ago, they apologize to her and say they are going to reinput it.... this new location is a joke, its truly insane that a Mcdonalds is operating like this, and its been a few months since their brand new building opened.",0
"They forgot half of my order, when I called them back ( it was drive though) the girl that worked there gave me huge attitude, rolled her eyes on me and shut down the window , after new moments have me my bag with NOT CORRECT ORDER still. The most shocking thing was the attitude. Ruined our mood. Do not recommend! There are plenty McDonald restaurants in the area. Definitely avoiding this one.
Tip to owners : don",0
"The white guy at the drive thru was good and friendly.  The reception was right.. But when I got my order, it was wrong.  I went inside to get corrected. The cashier and manager had some sort of rival  gang problem. Instead of walking away from the problems. They all started fighting. It was horrible. I won't ever go back there.",0
"The studio city location has the worst service of any restaurant I know of. Drive thru is marginally ok, but inside is chaos. There are people in the kitchen who occasionally come out to the counter to reluctantly help customers. No one is charge. It makes me wish we had a real McDonalds nearby. I left a cold order of fries on the counter because no one called out the order number. Never did get my hamburger. I'm giving them one star because the food is fine, if and when you get it.",0
How rude of the driver thus person that worked on 3/15/2023 around 7:50pm we were wanting to get some fries and chicken nuggets and some drinks and hoping to enjoy a amazing meal from this McDonald's but we lost our appetites due to the drive thu person using a loud rude unprofessional tone the worker seemed rushed and we didn't even get our sodas due to the person being so rude. Not ok.,0
"Even after they remodeled with 2 drive-thru lanes, they are not equipped for it. It's super slow that you can order UberEATS and still get it faster. Worse McDonald's ever, and slowest ""fast"" food in ever.",0
"Cashier on turn Apr-30-23 at 9:52a pretend didn't hear when when I asked twice please repeat the order, just told me go to the next window, of course the order was wrong",0

"Can't believe this place is brand new and the parking lot is as horrible as it is. This is the worst design I've ever seen. If there are people in the Drive-Thru everyone in the parking lot is trapped in the parking lot.... no menus, no front of store employees and when you do show at the counter, it's like the employees are scared to leave the kitchen like they have high anxiety of actually facing someone or something. You can stand there at the counter forever and no one will ever come",0
"After sitting in the drive thru for an hour, spending almost $50, asking for sauces and getting on the highway we discovered 3 missing large fries and no sauces. We returned and received 3 cold fries with absolutely no salt on them. Others were also complaining of incomplete orders as well.",0
"Very disappointing after they rebuilt the whole building.  It is supposed to be the most modern of Equipment and yet it was the slowest experience I have ever had at a McDonald's, and only for two egg McMuffins.  Then, the English muffin was burnt on both sandwiches.  The staff definitely did not want to be there.  It is my closest McDonald's but I will definitely be driving the longer distance next time.  Just avoid this spot no matter what.",0
"It took 1 plus hours to get thru the drive thru.  The drive thru is such that once in line you cannot get out. No one apologised for the abnormal wait time. When I got my food, the fries where cold and the taste old. I usually to not complain about a restaurant but 1 plus hours in a drive thru line is ludicrous. Especially for a fast food establishment.",0
"This place has ZERO customer service. From no one being at the front counter to long waits to get food, to getting your order wrong then getting cold food when they ""remake"" your order. This is one McDonald's you'll want to avoid going to.",0
"I ordered from McDonald's and I did not receive my Sausage Egg McMuffin.
The previous times that I have ordered from this location..they have messed up my order.",0
Rebuilt McDonald's on a lot that is way too small. 2 lane drive thru weaves through the small parking lot making it impossible to get out if you parked and ate inside.,0
Literally the worst they literally never have working registers crazy wait times tonight they didn have food?? They said they wouldn have any food for another hr.. I work night shifts in the Area and they,0
Don go. There another one up the street. This is the worst McDonald to ever exist. It actually not even a real McDonald. I think the franchise owner is doing their own thing here. the food ,0

"The new location is attractive.
The staff member taking the orders was great, but the person putting our order together gave us the wrong items.
We paid for an upsize and got a lesser-priced size.

Don go !  Usually  meals have been sitting around getting cold and stale before being served in drive through.  I even asked server to please get me fresh fries since mine were cold and her response was ,0
Never again will I order from here. 2 times ordered mistakes were made. Both were using the app so was apps fault but because they were short staff they could not find time to help and fix my order. Waited 20 minutes to leave with nothing and not even sure my order was canceled.,0
We have given this newly remodeled McDonalds a few chances. The only difference is they now can jam more cars in their drive thru. They will still make you pull up and wait for your order and forget that you're waiting. Same problem as before. Having this happen multiple times seems ridiculous and we don't even frequent this place. Location is convenient but not worth it.,0
"My experience was ok. They forgot little things in my order, like a straw for iced tea, and cream and sugar that i requested.  The wifi is not available like they stated, when searching for wifi there is no ""mcdonals wifi"" instead it was a wired name like EBOS. The connection did not allow for simple web browsing.  For a Mcdonalds thats near universal studios. This place is ok.",0

Unfortunately almost everyone that works at the Lankershim and Riverside location are so unprofessional.,0

in my delivery order,  napkins, straws, a whole order of fries. Pay attention , people. Okay this time you forgot a whole hamburger.  I ordered a Big Mac , it's on the delivery receipt , but it's nowhere to be found.  Furthermore, you sent a cookie that I didn't ask for in this order. What's that a consolation prize for losing the Big Mac.",0
Worst drive thru set up I ever experienced. No way out unless you go into the drive thru line and wait.,0
"It amazing how many items you can get wrong in one order. Fries were double salted yet undercooked. Soda wasn't what I asked for. Really just bad service from the drive thru, on multiple occasions.  This location does not properly represent the McDonald's brand.",0
"After waiting in drive through for 20 minutes,  I ordered a filet o fish and large fries with ketchup,  just to get a regular size fries not even filled to the top either , and a  filet of fish with no tarter sauce , and 1/4 of a peice of cheese.  I always check my food right then and there because this location usually messes up drive though orders , and  when I showed them  the employee gave me a attitude and rolled their eyes at me . She even tried to say the fries fell out of the box into the bag . I showed her the bag being empty ,and even made the comment. Even no ketchup.  She then said I had to pull out of the drive through to wait for my order to be fixed it would be 5 to 10 minutes, since my lunch is only 30 minutes, I had no choice but to leave.",0
The parking lot is one of the worst. All the spots are way too narrow and cramped.,0
"Food was hard and cheese danishes were hard
Workers forgot to give me water bottles.
They were just talking and seemed like they weren",0
Good fast service..went in ange cl was awesome in da drive thru...be back soon,0
"Just ordered two large drinks and two large fries. Both drinks taste wonky as if the syrup in the machines are off. And to top it all off, they had me pull to the side to wait on 2 (TWO) large fries.

Won't recommend this location to anyone looking for decent McDonald's food/drinks. Makes me glad I only ordered fries and drinks, I'd hate to see what else they'd wreck.",0
"Used the app to order, but took 30 minutes to get it to me at the counter. That's way too long. Tons of people got served before I did and my order was placed well before the other customers showed up. The only thing going for this place is that it's 24Hours drive through. And dont use the app, relaying orders to individual stores may have some bugs.

08/15/21
Update: this place is torn down. The building razed and the lot surrounded by fencing. I guess the bums from the nearby overpass finally took its toll. Too bad cuz the 24 hour drive thru was pretty convenient.",0
This location should have stayed closed. Why do they have a re-opening sign when they're only operating for drive thru. What about the pedestrians? The ones who can't drive? At least I was able to walk in and  order food before they remodeled. I live less than a mile from here and I can't walk over and physically order food? And why is there a parking lot if we can't walk in. And how rude the associate was that I basically should have known better that they were only running the drive thru? You're better off going to the one on burbank Blvd. Who puts a double lane on a drive thru and doesn't expect problems? This isn't it McDonald's... 20 minutes sitting in a drive thru...,0
Employee at the first window was very helpful and he made sure my order was right however the girl at the second one ignored me and looked confused. The muffin sandwich bread was stale and very tough and the hash browns were cold and also tasted like they sat on a shelf for way too long. After 2 bites I threw it in the trash and purchased a sandwich from a near by gas station much better food). I'm from out of town and on my way to a meeting so returning wasn't an option.,0
"I had quite possibly my worst McDonald's experience ever here. After ordering a sausage egg mcmuffin with a biscuit instead of English muffin, the order taker said

""ok I'll punch it in so it comes out a good deal for you.""

Um... Ok...

When I got the order it ONLY had egg. I politely informed the person at the drive through window, but they refused to correct the order, saying in a absolute terms that this is what I ordered and if I wanted what I ACTUALLY ordered I'd have to get back in line and place a new order!!

What the hell???

I won't be coming back here!",0
"I'm not sure what's wrong with this location, but half the time I go there the food I get is old and cold. Today I went through the drive-thru and they had a rush, there were about 10 cars ahead of me. So I'm not sure how they can serve me cold food when they're constantly feeling orders. Just extremely disappointed with this location. I ordered a big Mac combo and the big Mac was cold and the fries were even colder",0
"The employees just kept screaming the n word. I wasn even trying to eat here, I was just walking by. A",0
"The worst place in the valley
Nasty personal,nigth time manager it's the more inefficient person to rule a place,no brain,incredible how this person work in a restaurant. Never comes back.",0
All I ordered was 2 mcribs for $6 drive-thru. They asked me to pull into parking lot and wait. Ended up waiting 25 minutes before I got my order. They claimed the manager couldn't find me. It is a very small parking lot. The manager didn't try very hard. I ended up calling them to remind them about my order. They came out with the same mcribs and handed them to me by this time the were slightly warm and very soggy. The only explanation I got was we're so sorry. I just left immediately otherwise I would have lost my cool if I stayed. Ended up just throwing my order away after one bite. Lost my appetite.,0
Bad Service Bad Attitude! Gave me the wrong drink and charge me for 2 sandwiches when I ordered one. I was in a hurry to the office (around 8AM) and I didn't have time to argue. When I got to second window and I was handed the bag and the window shut by someone who looked like she'd rather be anywhere but there. Terrible service.,0
This McDonald,0
"Ordered 4 pies through doordash. The bags come sealed so I know it's not the drivers fault. They only put 2 in the bag, so half the order was missing!!
Called to see what's up, Christian basically told me 'too bad, nothing I can do'",0
"I've given this location a few chances over the last two years and while the drive thru is fast, the drinks taste wrong every time. Something about their soda machine is just not working like other locations and hasn't been for a long time.",0
This McDonald's is garbage. Dirty. No soda. Only take orders from 1 of the 2 lanes. Nope.,0
"TERRIBLE. Got our orders wrong and when I got home it was missing my entire meal...
NEVER WILL I EVER RETURN HERE.

Manager Rosalina or Rosaline is terrible as well she is clueless and she has no idea how to repay or provide refund for this mistake. She called back saying she can do anything I퐉 too busy I can",0
This place has changed for the worse in the past few months. Previously well-staffed with courteous people. Now they don even look at you when you place your order. Not even simple please and thank you. I guess the cream of the crop left and moved up. Now it staffed by stoner high school dropouts! They co,0
"The drive thru girl lied to me and the mgr stepped in to assist and the next time I went there, I started out happy and said hi
She did not answer....wierdo!

Not cool to hold grudges.  I don't.  Every day, is a new day and a chance to clean up messes.  She could fix it and apologize but, she chooses to ack like a child!",0
"I was there this morning at 10:00 a.m., thinking about ordering breakfast and coffee. The woman on the intercom wasn't really friendly and did not explain to me why they were not serving breakfast at this time. I thought breakfast was served throughout the day no matter what but I guess I was wrong. I've never had an issue with this McDonald's but this was a first and disappointing",0
"This Asian guy on the second window asks me to drive to their parking area because the order is not ready and said he will bring it to me. I waited for 10 minutes in the car and he never brought it.  I decided to walk in the restaurant, they had the bag just laying there.

Why would he ask me to wait in the car if he never planned on bringing it to me??  Bad service!",0
"My whole order was a lost, the oatmeal was not closed correctly and so all the order got wet and the oatmeal did not cook right .Then, they didn't even supply me with spoons. I asked for cream and sugar in my coffee, and they gave it to me black and  they got upset because asked them please add what I had asked for, in my coffee.
I ordered two breakfast burritos and they were cold, it's frustrating how bad some employees are trained they don't have any pride on what they do, nor care about service they provide is just a shame.",0
"We ordered our food (It was free egg mcmuffin day) and before we even sat down they brought it to us, clearly it was made before we ordered. It was cold in the middle. They proceeded to stare, whisper, and laugh at us. I was uncomfortable eating the food, afraid they had spit in it so we left without touching a thing.",0
Lazy people very rude when they fall behind which is alot they dont use the register and wont help with kiosk they need new staff,0
"It took several minutes for someone to take our order, then our order took forever and was wrong. My Mc muffin was rock hard and instead of the cheeseburger my friend ordered he received a Mc chicken with cheese. they were out of sweet tea and the little straw trash bin on the soda fountain was bursting out and spilling into the ice catch. This facility is dirty, packed both inside and in the drive thru, and is obviously understaffed.",0
"They got my order wrong... This happens often.

To make things worse they are very inefficient. Ordered a small fries, they served 10 other people before I got mine. Seriously, fill up a small bag with fries while you await other order burgers. I used to worl at McDonalds 10 years ago and know how it should be run. Horrible!

Ironically two other individuals complained about their order while I waited and one got into an argument with the manager over cold cheese.",0
"The drive through at this McDonald's has always been busy every time I've gone.  It's honestly worth driving a little extra to another location if you are in a hurry.  I've been stuck in the drive thru line for over 15 minutes on several occasions just ordering a single cheeseburger.  Granted, compared to In and Out that's nothing, but this is McDonalds.  That aside, the interior has always been pretty clean when I've went inside.  If you go for breakfast on the weekends, once again, be prepared to wait.  They do take Apple Pay and Android pay!  The one time I used it, the person behind the counter actually knew what it was.  So many places tell you they don't have it but just don't know what it is.  Another big plus is the drive through is 24 hours.",0
"The staff who took our order doesn't have customer service. Very impatient. In fairness he is so quick taking our order and he knows his menu.
Sad that frappe machine doesn't work.
No choice as thia is the only place that's open for breakfast here at universal.",0
"I ordered a Mcdouble, which was on their outside drive thru menu. When it came up on the order screen it was shown as a Bacon Mcdouble, I told them that I just wanted the regular Mcdouble, no bacon. So all they did was note NO Bacon, and still charged me the full price for a Bacon Mcdouble. When I got to the window I clarified again, but was told they didn't have that in their system, and that I had to pay the full price for the Bacon Mcdouble. I asked ro talk to the manager who then told me they didn't have what I ordered. I told him to go out and check his menu, because it was on there. He told me he didn't need to, that it was not on the menu. He was very rude and dismissive. I realize it is just a few cents difference, but why should anyone pay for something they didn't order, especially if what you ordered is on the menu. I see no reason to be treated so unprofessionally, and rudely. I don't recommend visiting this McDonalds, luckily there are plenty of others near by who treat people with respect.",0
"Drive thru order was botched. We paid for two milks and upon arriving home, discovered that there were no milks and instead of the healthier grilled chicken that my wife ordered, she was unable to eat the crispy chicken that we received due to dietary reasons...what a waste. Hopefully somebody got the milks we bought-

Avoid the drive thru at all costs! This was not the first time; and we should have stopped and checked the order-

Never again",0
I just left there 10 mins ago and my fries were horrible. They weren't even fresh and definitely something I would NEVER give to a customer,0
Had a terrible experience from start to finish.. An order taker in the drive thru even though there was not a back up- he interrupted my ordering- got it wrong(i corrected him)- the cashier had it wrong(i corrected him)- then they handed me the wrong order- then the fish sandwich was burnt and tasted old and the chicken nuggets tasted like very bad chicken.. Worst McDonald's experience ever.,0
I asked for a peppermint mocha and all was well until I realized the hot cup they served it in was cold by the time it was too late and I was already home. Drive thru service not the best when you have to yell out the order multiple times.,0
"My brother and I tolerate it because it's close to us and it's open when no one else is.  But. .. you get the loonies showing up there. Homeless wandering in and out filling up for free their gutter cups at the soda machine. Smells, psych ward cryouts and who knows what else are the norm so do yourself a favor and order by the drive through and get the hell out quick.",0
"bad night. went for a burger. got trapped in the drive thru. took almost ten min to get to the order screen, only to find out their grill was down. and they aren't cooking meat, just nuggets. trapped for another ten minutes, for a total of almost twenty minutes with nothing to show for it. things happen, just put a damn sign up.",0
Happy it,0
"Stopped here on the way to LA. Every employee i talked to had TERRIBLE customer service. Everyone there looks miserable. I heard a man ask to enter the mens restroom to just wash his hands while they were cleaning, the person cleaning refused and then he asked the lady at the register if he could ask the person cleaning to let him inside the restroom and she told him to go to the womens restroom with a huge attitude! Really rude workers.",0
"Never a correct order - last night they forgot to put patties on both kid's hamburger buns, the kitchen timers are always beeping, not very clean, parking is limited. Staff is friendly. Kids like it so we'll continue to come here.",0
"Slow. All. The. Time. I have never come to this location and quickly got my good and out, it's always this long process (just for my order to be wrong).  I wish they put in the attention to detail that the Studio City location puts in.",0

Cold nuggets.  Homeless people just walking around cars.,0

Took 40 whole minutes from the time I entered the drive through before I got my food.,0

"It's a McDonald's so the food is very consistent. Unfortunately, the parking lot is impossible to use since the drive through wraps through it. I've been stuck in the parking lot for 20 minutes with no way to get out.",0
Bad exsperence two days in a row no mc rib! Drive through slow no matter what time i go there. Fries old on several different occasions. Isaac the night manager was sweet!,0
"Upon leaving this McDonald's on Friday morning. I turned around just in time to see a  Rat, Not a mouse ,A GINOURMOUS RAT!!
I Kid you not, this Heavy Hitter was the size of a Men's Shoe Size 12!!!
I was amazed at how tame it was...
Kinda scary the way it just lingered in the parking lot without a worry in the world.
Maybe It was Stuart Little and was waiting for his food in the drive thru.
Unsure , either way, If you come To this McDonald's you might be blessed with his Presence..
Enjoy your McMuffin!! 占쏙",0
"Third time this year that the drive thru got my order wrong, and I've only been four times!  And the manager expected me to get back in my car, drive back to the restaurant and wait in line again to get it fixed- I don't think so!",0
"Gross bathrooms, you know it's sketchy because they have security outside of it.",0
Not a good service nd i asked for ranch nd ketchup they didnt served me anything just becus they wanted to have a fast drive through,0
Like stepping back into the 70s.. this place hasn't been updated for many decades by the looks of it. Very old fashioned. Food a little greasy and saltier than other McDonald's branches I've been to.,0
"EV rude, manager lady also rude.",0
Tried calling to find out what the Happy Meal toy is today for grandson. The phone has been busy for 45 minutes. Must be off the hook. Going elsewhere.,0
The afternoon crew over there is very ignorant and arrogant! I don't know if that was just an incident or that's there normal but It was unpleasant to order from them!,0
"Today 3/18/2022 restaurant is closed for renovation no date when will reopen, but Google maps shows as open",0
The McDonald's I just went to was so filthy I didn't even eat there. The parking lot was disgusting all around the outside of the building was really filthy. Inside was better but not by that much.,0
People brought their own food to this place (like 12 people) yams and hard boiled eggs and ordered2 sandwiches and 12 coffees and too all the tables.  People were complaining but management did nothing,0
"The food there sucks, it is so tasteless & I've even got a sausage mcmuffin here & it wasn't done, plus the coke is really bad.. no coke just seltzer water... never again",0
"Cold burgers disgusting looking and tasting meat, the fries were the only ",0
"Slowest drive thru ever, avoid at all costs",0
"Do not eat this food. It will kill you. Is not even food. If there was -5 stars, I would give it that. If you feed the stuff to your kid, there's something really wrong with you.",0
Just left... asked to make sure to add flavor to my iced coffee cus last time they didnt.... well... I got plain iced coffee again!!!,0
Used drive-thru around 2am just to find out that they were only taking cash because the card terminal was not working. I only had a few bucks cash to spend and I even got my oder wrong. Terrible experience!,0
Chicken tenders were hard as rocks. The bun on the buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich was burnt inside and hard. Could not eat!,0
The worst McDonald's to get breakfast really early in the morning I always go try to get breakfast around 4 in the morning and there card reader is never working I don't understand how every day at 4 a.m. they can't accept debit or credit card this is been going on for a very long time,0
"This was one of the worse experiences I've ever had.  We sat in the parking lot for 20 minutes waiting for our order.  They forgot about our order.  Then when I got it, it was missing stuff.",0
This place has changed a lot.They forget about your order or forgets certain things in your order.Now there are more homeless's.Now there are teenagers working there and messing up your order.My grandma asked for a ice cream cone but they gave her a cup instead.I recommend going to a different McDonald's for right now until they fix the problems.,0
How do you mess up this many orders? And the fries were weird. Just go to a different McDonald's,0
It appears this location burned down or was leveled for reconstruction.  There is no building only steel support beams and a fence around the lot.,0
Dining room has gnats Told employee but no reaction Maybe the gnats amoing others is why i raely go. Was in a giant hurry only reason,0
Waited about half an hour in the drive thru.  They informed us they could only accept cash.  No sign telling us that before pulling in.  Don't go here late night.,0

How incompetent can you be when you have all this staff standing there and no one willing to help the customer- why does a manager have to tell their employees to help a customer?? You see a customer you help them..  On top of that?a lady that put her order in the kiosk after I had given mine  was given her order first!!! We literally ordered almost the same things and she was helped before ,0

"The absolute worst McDonald's I've ever dealt with. The most incompetent management I've ever experienced.
First 2 out of my last 3 breakfast orders were wrong. But didn't realize until I got to work. I cannot leave my job to go back.
Then today I got a steak, egg, and cheese bagel. Which was right with the exception of 2 long black hairs in it.
I stopped back on my way home and asked for a manager.
The first manager only asked for a receipt. She then left and got another manager. She was a heavy set black woman. She was the most ignorant, vile person that I've ever dealt with. Not even an apology. Her response was to bring it back? 5 hours later? When I said that was ridiculous, she closed the window and walked away. I asked for a corporate phone number and she refused.
I called and I can only assume it was the same ignorant woman because she put the phone down and left it off the hook.
I called again for the phone number and she said its on my receipt and hung up.
She is clearly incompetent and doesn't deserve her jib.
Funny thing is I didn't ask for anything free! An I'm sorry may have been enough.
But nothing even close. I would never recommend this dump of a McDonald's nor the clearly racist manager.
I will stop at nothing now to make sure she can't treat anyone like this again",0
"Whatever you do, do NOT go to this McDonald's location. There's a reason why I rated it one star and I can kindly explain why. While the food there is good, I simply cannot stare at these people the same way anymore. A hour or two ago, I showed up to get some food and there was this one woman working behind the register (I don't remember her name, but I assume she was a manager or something. She was in a blue shirt and glasses and that's all I can remember). There was an annoying beeping sound that seemed concerning and I politely asked (key word here is ""politely"") them to investigate it and make it stop. They didn't bother to check it, which shows that they're neglectful of the resources around their workplace. The reaction I got from this woman was 100% disrespectful and told me to get out of her store and never come back and even tried to call 911 on me. It's pretty obvious that I caught this woman on a bad day. Clearly, I was furious because I felt like she was deliberately trying to get under my skin and using that to her advantage. You know what they call people like her? A bully. I was bullied by the manager because I had a concern that needed to be addressed. I was not trying to show up on this woman at any point during my visit. I was trying to be as lenient as I possibly could. If the woman I was referring to was actually a manager of this establishment, she needs to be put in her place because that's NOT how a manager should treat her customers. I do not like being antagonized, especially by an employee and it really showed during this visit. Come to think about it, I've been checking on other reviews of this location they all had numerous problems with this particular person. Obviously, I'm heartbroken because now I don't have anywhere to go to eat after my work shift. I'm only relegated to the Chick-Fil-A a minute down the road and even I know they have better hearts and respect than this woman did (and their food is also good). As a man diagnosed with autism, I strongly advise people to stay away from this location at all costs. If you really need to go to a McDonald's, steer clear of this location. It's not worth your time and it's not worth your sanity. Also, their drink machine has been broken and flat for at least a few months and they didn't fix that either. I will be contacting corporate about the antics going afoot at this location.",0
"I got what I ordered wich was an ice coffe and one sausage burrito. There was no line how ever the attendant was not attentive causing my Check out time to be close to ten minutes for a very simple order I have to change my rating to one star, shortly after eating my burrito I got very sick to my stomach.",0
Slowest McDonald's I've ever been to and screwed up my entire order. Also waited 15 minutes and food was cold. Will never go back. Simple job yet these people are incapable.,0
"Being a pregnant female the experience I had with working there just recently was very terrible I was treated very poorly by my managers and coworkers. I had only one break my entire shift which means I could only eat one time and my manager daisy made me take a break in the mornings which wasn right, to eat early and then go hungry till I got off. Daisy was a very rude manager gave me a hard time on my 3 rd day I told them this was my first time working there never don a job like this as a manager she should퐒e been more patient and had some respect. She even talked about me to her friends but would speak in her language so I wouldn understand. Karen was another manager that was never the was training me and was pretty rude as well. Rachel was another. I would like to sue for discrimination against my pregnancy and harsh treatment during my time working there. I felt very uncomfortable. The Hispanic females that work there are like the ones in charge they even take mini breaks but I only had one my whole shift pregnant female standing in one spot for the whole day the only person that was nice was Kimberly . I will be sueing this company and I should press charges against nicki Nelson.",0
Very cold hash brown. Egg mcmuffin not so great either,0
"Ordered via the kiosk.

Looks like management has posted a sign, order via kiosk to get a free cookie. My order didn't contain one. I asked the associate, she was puzzled. They had to discuss with 3 other folks and finally one of them gave one with complete displeasure.

Kiosk didn't give a paper bill to provide a direct feedback. With modern tech, they should switch to a sms or email for whoever wants a digital copy.",0
I ordered breakfast sandwiches and hash browns. It was 12 in the afternoon so I didn't mind pulling to the side to wait. After 15 minutes no one had come out yet. I went inside and by the time I talked to the manager it had been 20 minutes. She told me it was my fault because I ordered breakfast at noon and was INCREDIBLY rude with an unbelievable attitude. I told her I wanted my money back. She ignored me. Five minutes later I started asking every employee if I could have my money back. The manager first ignored me and then started yelling. I finally had to call my wife inside to deal with her because she was so unprofessional. 30 minutes had gone by at this point. Worst run restaurant I've ever been to.,0
"Ordered a burger at the drive-through. I was made to wait for 20 minutes and when the food came I was given the wrong order. I brought it inside to talk the employees so I could get the correct food. I spoke with the manager and she was unbelievably rude. Acted like it was my fault that my daughter was given the wrong burger. I finally was given the right burger but I have no idea why the manager made it such an awful experience.
To top it off, I walked into the bathroom. There was someone sitting in the stall. He flushed and walked out. He was an employee and he didn't wash his hands. Just walked out of the bathroom and when I came out he was making burgers. Disgusting!",0
This McDonalds on Blackwood Clementon Rd is very unprofessional and I won't be going back there! The staff are clueless about their job and they are rude.,0
Floor soapy! We were here for an hour or so and the floor was soapy and slippery the whole time like they used too much soap in the mop bucket. Watched someone slip in the entryway.  Employees didn care.  Food and play place a,0
"Just don't. The manager on tonight was not helpful. I waited forever to order at the drive up spot. Than waited well over 5 mins then to pay and there was only 1 car besides me in line and they waited a while to pay as well.  Then to not get my order properly made and then was told my order was made correctly and that next time I would be charged extra for what they had to do, which was to make my order right !

I asked for a macchiato.  Got a large cup of sugar and cream WITH A SQUIRT OF ESPRESSO. I wanted macchiato not a cup of creamer and sugar. I asked for more espresso to be added and got attitude about it and was told they would have to charge me more next time FOR THE ESPRESSO! They clearly do not realize what an macchiato is! It has espresso in it and not just a 7th of cup of espresso! Manager was not helpful. Said that's the way its made. I said no its not. I've been to many other McDonald's and this isn't how they make it. I also have had this at a lot of other coffee places and that what they gave me wasn't a macchiato. He said I work at 3 other McDonald's no its not. So I told him which one I like to go to that makes it right. So then he proceeds to say we'll that is how our machine makes it. Didn't want to help. Just argue and get rid of me. I didn't appreciate being treated like I was and that I would be charged for wanting espresso in my drink that is supposed to have espresso!
Could tell they were not having a good night and dint seem to care to make things right and wanted  to just get rid of me.So I took my stuff and  left.",0
This used to be a great store. But recently they can make frappe. Sad to not be able to fill ,0

"Tried to order something at the drive thru around 11pm and was given zero response during the 20 minutes that I waited. According to what it says online, the place was suppose to be open til 12am and yet I couldn't get a order in around 11pm. I sometimes wonder if the owner knows that they been closing up earlier than usual.",0
I hate McDonald's ever since they got rid of the breakfast bagel sandwiches lol was the only decent food left that I liked. But decent fries and sundaes. Only went cause my daughter asked for something.,0
Usually come here because they have their stuff together. Today was the exact opposite. Hit the drive through for 2 things and it took over 30 minutes. Had to wait in the parking lot for a big mac meal and a happy meal???,0
I just ordered from door dash and this McDonald's sent my sons hotcakes with no butter or syrup. They didnt even send jelly for the biscuits?? Just disappointed that's all. Have a good day.,0
"this location regularly overcharges. in  a two week period, members of this household were charged $4.25 for large fries, and $9 for a filet o fish meal. this is not the first time this location has done this, but it will be the last time",0
"The order clerk and her Manager Nikki refused to give me a glass for water, accusing that I might steal soda.  Should I stop giving McDonalds $20 daily business and another $100 for my team because of Nikkis horrible accusatory stance?  The main manager should be fired for not training customer unfriendly Nikki.",0
"I ordered Mcnuggets. They were okay. At least I thought. But by the time I arrived home, my stomach was bubbling. Had to move like lightening to get to the bathroom. Barely made it. I will never order from or eat there again.",0
"Since the kiosk was introduced into the restaurants, the staff does not even acknowledge your presence. Plus, they are over-staffed. There are so many servers bringing food to the tables that they bump into each other and customers constantly. And the overcrowded staff in the back looks like pure chaos. I went to the register to place my order cause I prefer to talk to a human being, and the counter person told me to ""go use the kiosk. I'm busy."" There is no organization and order, just chaos and confusion. With all the extra staff and the introduction of the kiosks, service is even slower than before and they still get it wrong!",0
"Absolutely horrible place. They have people working the drive-thru speaker who can barely speak English, get the order wrong, and are not polite.  When I have ordered here, they mess up the order almost every time.  I wonder if there is a manager here because the employees seem more intent on fooling around and laughing than paying attention to their customers.  They need to get things straightened out and realize that if they don't provide better service, they will go out of business.  I will not return to this one and go to the McDonald's on Route 70 instead.",0
"I was not given a receipt otherwise I would've complained privately.

I pulled into the drive thru around 2:50 PM. It was about a one or two minute wait before me and the woman in the second drive thru lane were answered. Before that, someone must have accidentally switched their headset on because all I heard was a lot of laughing and talking in the background.

When I pulled around to pay, the woman at the first window wasn't able to locate my order for a moment. But she triple checked to make sure that what she had was accurate. So I paid, received my change, and she shut the window without another word (or my receipt.)

I pull up to the next window to get my food and drinks. The girl at that window double checked which order was mine, then handed me my food. Even though I ordered a large Coke, I was given a medium Coke but didn't see any use in complaining because I didn't want to hold her lane up.

When I pulled away, I started eating my medium fry only to discover that the top fries were over salted and mushy. I figured they must've got mixed in with the fresh fries and kept eating. I was wrong. They only got worse. They got mushier and more stale. Like someone had reheated them in a microwave. Absolutely disgusting. I was too annoyed at that point to turn around and go all the way back. I don't expect fries to be perfect all the time, but I do expect not to get the fries that should've been written off as waste.

The only reason that I'm doing 2 stars instead of 1 is because the teens here are very nice. They go above and beyond to make sure everything is okay. Especially when I'm inside using the kiosk. But something about food quality and drive thru efficiency needs to be revamped. This isn't the first time I've received stale fries or had an order done incorrectly at this location. I only come here because this is the only McDonald's on my route that doesn't put me out of the way, but the lack of efficiency is seriously frustrating.",0
Very loud. The managers kids and grandkids were running around the place and causing a mess. Very loud and took forever to get my food. I did not like this place one bit. Maybe if the kids weren't running around doing whatever they wanted itd be better. I recommend going to a different McDonald's their are a few others near by.,0
I work around the corner from this particular location. My coworkers were all excited to see the newly renovated location. I usually don't get fast food but I really wanted a milkshake before work. How do you redo the entire building but you still don't have any milkshakes?! I should've taken the extra drive and gone to Chick fil A.,0
"These are the slowest off-task workers I've ever seen. I stop here multiple nights a week for coffee and a bite. It's always ""can you please pull around""...IT'S ONLY ME IN LINE! For what? A coffee and fries.",0
"This location is ok. When I was there last week, was told to go to first window to pay. No one was there, waited a few and no one came so I pulled up to the next window.  ( Payment was to be made at the first window). Then they get my order wrong. I was missing a drink and given an extra fri. So I had one person with no drink and Fri's that no one wanted. When I told the girl I was missing a drink she just stared at me like I was speaking another language. I left unhappy.
Went back a few weeks ago, my husband's burger was raw inside. For convenience on my way home today, ordered 3 meals. Asked the lady at the Drive-Thru to double check. She looked inside,said yes it's all there. Git home.... Missing a burger.",0
"There was hair in my food so i took it back and when i told the manager she said to me, "" theres no possible way there could be hair in our food."" I laughed and said well i dont see a hairnet on your head and she started yelling and arguing with me about giving me my money back. She finally gave it back after arguing the point with me while i had a whole line behind me. Ignorant and you do not treat customers like that. Period. Why would i lie about hair being in my food anyway? We were traveling i did not want to turn around. Haha what a joke. Thank god i never have to go there again. I dont live anywhere near there.",0
The McDonald's on Haddonfield Berlin Road in Voorhees is the worst place ever to get food I've ordered from there and they charge my credit card almost $40 and only gave me half my order and never gave me my receipt so I have no way to get the food or get the money back. So I would advise people to take as much time as you need in the Drive-Thru to make sure you have all your food that you actually ordered,0

The kids that work there are nice, the ""manager Jesus"" bit of an attitude.",0
They messed up a simple order like a four piece Chicken Mcnugget and a beverage. The young lady taking the order misunderstood me when I be asked for a Orange drink and charged for a Orange juice. So when I went to the window I thought the order was confirmed and corrected and the price was lowered but to no avail when I received my beverage it was a Orange soda. I wet around the drive through again spoke to the manager and she apologized. Last visit to this McDonald's.,0
"This is the most unprofessional McDonalds I have EVER ordered from. I ordered using uber eats and when my food arrived it was packaged with stickers stuck all around the bag where as I could barely open the bag. There is a gaping hole in the bag and this is not even to mention the poor quality of the food. Half of the food was cold, my hashbrown was crushed and bent, and my sandwich was poorly packaged. No care went into the process of my order. I do not recommend anyone to purchase anything as little as a water bottle from this establishment. I am sick to my stomach at the fashion my food was given to me in. NEVER AGAIN!",0
"Hi,

I have just purchased medium fries and large chocolate shake.

"Your company is advertising support for front line workers but your company is very disrespectful to people who are helping others.

I was about to be late for work so I left and went to dunkin donuts.You guys should NEVER advertise free meals for front line workers when its clearly a lie. There is no support.",0
Had the longest wait of my life for some cheap food. Not only was the wait long for everyone but whoever was working that day gave zero Fs because they kept giving me the wrong order and just told me to move up and then proceed to hand me a bag that they already handed to someone else that I saw digging thru it. Mind you fries are all over the place and I퐉 happy to enjoy a meal that been on someone else,0
Nasty foul odor of chinese food overtook the place upon entering and in entire lobby. Employees must've had massive chinese take out order leading to the offensive odor. I lost my appetite and will avoid this location like corona virus.,0
"I went to the McD's on Rt 561 at (Roughly) 21:45hrs to get a 1/4 pounder meal with a milkshake. During the ordering, a woman loudly voiced acrossed the floor to the young lady assisting me that she is NOT to take ANY ice cream orders after 21:30.
The employee was as stunned as I and ask why and in an Arrogant voice. She said ""its because we GOTZ ( gotz) to clean the machine"" Well I felt this was rude and followed up with a question to this woman. I asked,  what if I get here at 21:45 and ask for a milkshake. She again in an Arrogant voice responded with, "" you aintz getting it"" ( aint'z) ( The rest of the staff laughed when she made this comment)
After all this and being made to wait 15 minutes for my order, I requested a refund and to speak to the manager. I was told by this woman that no manager was available.
So I went back the next day to report this incident, I ask the front customer representative to speak with a manager. Oddly enough, she directed my attention to the woman that I had this encounter with the night before.
So not only did I get HORRIBLE customer service in a language and tone that was less than professional, I was lied to as the customer service rep..AKA Manager Nicky was available the whole time.
If Nicky is the Manager and is leading that team, it won't be long until that location starts losing customers as they just loss 1...

I would go elsewhere to eat!",0
"Ok, here goes... I stopped into the location on Rt73 in west Berlin NJ  for lunch today. The drive through line was super long so I parked and went I side. I ordered a number 5 (artisan chicken sandwich) meal. I paid, waited like 15 minutes, they called my number and I brought my ticket to the counter and took my bag. I got to work and found out I didn't get a chicken sandwich but instead I got a big mac. Which normally wouldn't be an issue but I hate big macs, I've gotten sick eating one before and ever since I can't even look at a big mac without getting sick to my stomach. Needless to say I wasn't happy. I threw the bag in my car and went on with the rest of my work day... on the way home I stopped back in and brought the bag of food back to McDonald's. The manager named Rebecca came to the counter and I told her what happened and I showed her all of the food I got and explained to her what I was supposed to get.(keep in mind I didn't even touch a fry) She was super rude to me and said she can't do anything because I didn't save my receipt. I don't know about anyone else but I always hand my ticket in when they call my number to prove that it's my food they're handing out. And I asked her what's the difference between a receipt and the untouched food that I brought back? I asked for a refund because I was no longer hungry, she said no, I asked for a new meal, after 5 minutes of her spouting off why she couldn't make it right, she finally gave in and walked away from me huffing and puffing and yelled to the back ""make an artisan chicken sandwich"" so a couple minutes later someone put a bag with just the sandwich in it on the counter and I asked where the fries were and she said, ""there was nothing wrong with the fries earlier, just the sandwich"" so this miserable poop butt of a manager refused to give me fresh French fries with my sandwich and handed me back the old fries from 6 hours ago. She took this whole interaction so personal and was acting like the money was coming out of her pocket. My final argument was asking her if she thought I was lying and did she think I made the big mac and fries at my house and brought it in to pull one over on her? What a horrible experience. It sucks when you get 30 minutes for lunch and you're starving and wind up not being able to eat and it's someone else's fault. You want someone to make it right. Instead this manager who gets to use her little bit of power to make up her own rules and make it difficult for you. Like it would of ruined her entire life to fix their error and make it right. It just sucked, I'll NEVER go back there just because of her. And I hope no one else will either. That's how pissed if this whole mess made me...",0

"I went to McDonalds for lunch with my 2 little kids and Laurie took my order. One of the items I ordered was 2 cheeseburgers with NO MUSTARD.  She missed the request for NO MUSTARD, but I noticed the omission when she handed me my receipt. When I told her that I ordered my cheeseburgers with NO MUSTARD, her reply was ""No, you didnt.""  After that customer service blunder, she agreed to tell the person preparing my cheeseburgers not to put mustard on them.  Once we got our food, I had the unique experience of listening to her berate her cooking staff because they weren't going fast enough for the next 20 minutes while me and my 2 kids were trying to enjoy our meal. I will find another McDonalds to go to next time.",0

"A group of friends (6 of us total) were kicked out shortly after eating due to the ""store manager's orders"". Their rule is ""5 kids in the restaurant at a time"" because of an incident that happend a week ago where kids made a mess and broke a salt shaker. Two out of the group left and it was us 4 sitting there, having casual conversation in the side of the restaurant, and a second lady came up to us and asked us to leave again, because ""football kids are coming in"" and that there were too many kids at one time. Keep in mind we were not disrespectful or disruptive, McDonalds was just a place to eat, not hang out or lounge in our free time. Nearing adulthood, I felt very offended and quite frankly disrespected by store management AND their employees. Oh, I also waited 10 minutes for my 20 piece nugget and medium fries.",0

The drive thru is a joke. always messing up my order. Best to go inside or avoid this mcdonalds altogether.,0
"Didn eat dinner, so I ord",0
"I don't have high expectations for McDonald's, but this location is consistently disappointing. Lots of mistakes on simple orders.",0
Horrible service. She looked me right in my eyes and dumped my fries in the bag. After I ask why I was waiting in the drive thru,0
This location can never get an order correct. And they always seem to make me pull up and wait.,0
"Bought FOUR items here and they forgot one. I am still confused as to how you can mess up on only four items. After this visit, I am really concerned about our nation's education system. ",0
Drive thru is always a complete mess. Cannot call this ,0
if I can rate this a zero I would. I found yet another fly in my ice coffee this morning. it's a usual routine for me too get ice coffee everyday but the last 2 visits I made had flies in my drinks. I'm done with this McDonald's,0
"Just a snack but no napkins, not much fudge on Sunday",0
Over priced disgusting food.,0
Omg the big girl working the counter at night just stood there taking her time instead of helping me,0
No service at counter just kiosk if u know how 2 use.,0
"Apparently cutting a slice of bacon down the middle counts as 2 (literally) pieces of bacon...are they cheap owners or is it just poor management, I haven't made that conclusion just.",0
Quarter pounder was like warm.  Fries weren't salted.  Pathetic!,0
I can't digest what is served at fast food joints.  It runs right through like greased lightning...,0
typically get your order wrong. Check your purchase before you drive away.,0
I do not hate it I just don't eat fast food,0
Worst experience EVER!  Rude employees,0

Completely messed up our small order then took 15 minutes to correct.,0

Terrible service and such rude employees,0
Long wait at the drive thru and cold food.,0

"Perhaps the most poorly run McDonald in Texas. Visited on the weekend,  so naturally busier, but the management, attitude of employees, and physical condition make this a location, in my opinion, the worst location we퐒e ever visited.
1. Trash everywhere, see pic for example. Trash on the floors, tables, parking lot.
2. Dirty tables. Obviously tables get dirty. So we asked if a team member could wipe down a table to remove ketchup and prior visitor",0
"This is the closets Mickey D near us and we usually always have a good time. This time tonight we asked for extra sauce, the white lady with black hair, thick and wear a brown cardigan and bun? Was VERY RUDE when asked if their was extra sauce in the bag and closeed the sliding door before we can ask for more. She then re-opened it after seeing we were missing additional sauce from our order.. she was very rude cutting me off and stated you need to ask for extra sauce when ordering, since it now a charge for sauce? But anyways we don mind paying? It",0
"Incorrect orders most of the time, missing ingredients in the food or missing chicken nuggets. Poor quality of food.

I am not really a picky eater and don usually complain, but I gave this location a handful of chances?",0
I퐒e never come to this McDonald before and I never will again. The woman over the speaker was rude and handed me my bag and walked away. I,0
"I ordered a artisan chicken sandwich no tomatoes on 2/22/19 through the drive-thru and when I went to get my food they told me to pull up and wait. I waited half a hour to get this sandwich and chicken nuggets. The sandwich looks like it was thrown together, way too much sauce. It was all over the entire sandwich and on the inside of the box that made the bread soggy. And to top it all off they gave me the head of lettuce and brown lettuce.",0
"Frys were cold, did not give me my large drink that was ordered, and when I asked for my receipt, 3 people just walked around lost.. said forget it and left.",0
I always order the same 4 orders of the 20pc Nuggets. For some odd reason it $12 more expensive at this location than all the other stores in the metroplex. If you like to spend extra money for the same exact thing you can get from another location for cheaper than this is your spot. For me it not. The manager g,0
"Employees always seem bothered by having to work. If you ask for extra of something on your burger, they'll give you none of that and if you take something off they'll make sure you get extra of it... This has happened multiple times now.",0
Nice people but this location lacks staff. Childrens play area not clean. Smells of dirty mop. No soap in children bathroom bathroom smells of  bad odor,0
My hash brown had sooooo much grease that it soaked through the bag. GROSS!!!!!! I'll never get food from this location again!!!!!!!,0
"Manager on duty was very rude.  My husband went today to pick up a missing item from order from the previous night that they forgot to give us.  Instead of going above and beyond to correct their mistake and guarantee excellent customer service, she proceed to interrogate my husband rudely.  In today's world where there are so many options to eat, you think that people would put their best foot forward to make sure their customers have a good experience. I WILL NEVER spend my hard earned money at that location EVER AGAIN",0
"Staff wasn friendly AT ALL and these are literally the worst, coldest, most unsalted, most un",0
It use to be good but they got new owners and it like they are cutting corners to save money. Also the manager  just looks at you and not take your order,0
"Absolutely TERRIBLE customer service. Never in my years of walking this planet have I ever experienced such a terribly trained and terribly managed location. Charging me almost $30 for an order of pancakes and giving ME and attitude when it is THEIR mistake. I very calmly stated that there was an obvious mistake on the receipt, the cashier seemed new, but for some reason the manager thought it was appropriate to put the blame on ME and not their lack of being a good manager and training their employees properly. Disgusting behavior for a problem that required next to NO effort to fix, but the manager sought it better worth their time and effort to be nasty.",0
Incorrect order and couldn't mix Powerade and sprite for some reason.,0
"I have been in line for 10 minutes and how you have it set up you have one line you veer to the right of the intercom or to the left but you only have one lane going to those intercoms. I had several people behind me this lady comes around and cuts me off. I got out of my car I said excuse me you almost hit me and could have caused a catastrophic accident . She said that the lady told her to cut in front of me and I said who and the manager of that McDonald's Sylvia said I did. I told her you almost caused a catastrophic accident and she said it's a two-lane and I said no ma'am and other people in line roll their windows down and said it's only a one lane and Sylvia argued with all of us that were  in line  waiting. You're going to have a catastrophic accident there if you don't get two lanes drawn up. Number two, Sylvia should not be arguing with the customers in line and she did not serve us. I never use profanity I told her it was unprofessional and that it could have caused an accident and other people were telling her the same.I'm very disappointed how McDonald's has lowered the bar in hiring people that will argue with their customers when the  are trying to prevent an accident. I thought the motto is safety first.",0
"Absolutely TERRIBLE customer service is an understatement. The manager screams at everyone who is a customer. To me his young pond has no experience in customer service, I have never been to a place had experienced such a terribly trained and terribly managed location, this is very true. I have gone through drive threw and walked in. To see bad people working there, just do not care. I did send message to McDonald's Company, hopefully someone will see what",0
"The drive through service is horrible. They gave me the wrong order and was told to wait. I waited  for over 5 minutes for them! The manager Maria Gutierrez (might have her last name wrong), FIRE HER!! After waiting for so long, I had to drive through again, only for her to lie and say she gave me my food. Very rude individual. Had lost all my appetite by the time I got the food!",0
"The manager who attended this Roanoke store was very rude, the ice coffee had no caramel flavor, the cookies ",0
"Delivery- complete joke! Don't bother taking the time to order sauces for your Nuggets! I ordered 20 spicy,  40 reg, picked out at least 9 different dipping sauces as ""required "" not to mention Desired by my kiddos!! We did NOT get ONE sauce or even a ketchup!!! Just to make sure they were consistant with disregard, they didn't even give us straws either to go with our $3 mango smoothies...2 of them! So, 60 Nuggets-NO sauces  AT ALL!  Not the first time they have done us wrong on the Nuggets so buyer should be cautious!",0
"f I could give it -5 I would. Ordered on their own mobile app so it seems like they chose not to read /deliver the order actually ordered. I collected , drove 10 + minutes towards home before the kid figured out that his order had every single add on we had requested not be added. I called and , zero apology,  was told to drive back to the drive thru and collect. OH-KAY. Lovely customer service already. I get there and the 'manager' asks me to return the wrong order, I handed it back (untouched) and he made  huge scene of firing it in the trash. emmmm, your mistake. No apology and ALL the attitude ? Never , ever again. Calling the franchise owner. I would hate this guy to represent my business . I felt so sorry for his team mates /peers who were embarrassed by him.",0
"The person who takes your order always seems to be mad, the cashier is never polite and orders are almost always wrong. Good thing other better places to eat are around here.",0
They canceled my online order even though I ordered it 40 minutes before close and was just turning into their parking lot. They still had 10 minutes to be open. I understand I퐉 skimming time but that,0
Good quick service! But the lady that works at night front counter is very rude. It's a way to say something. People are spending their money.,0
"Went through the drive thru in a hurry to get my daughter to school, we found a hair in our food and was given the wrong drink. The manager on duty was very apologetic and gave me a refund. Even though I was disappointed with the hair in the food, we were treated very kindly and had no problem getting our money back",0
The food is fine. Service at the drive through is horrendous. Unprofessional and unhelpful.  It good that ther,0
Very unsatisfied. My husband and i came to this McDonalds it was locked and we had to used the drive thru and they told us they were accepting cash only. We ordered and they told us to pull around to the second window. We weren told our total. We weren given a receipt either and we were charged $25 for some late night driving home snacks. Coffe,0
I went there today with no cars in front of me in the drivethru.I ordered one large Sweet tea it took over 5 minutes for them to get. I should've have just went and got a fountain drink from 7eleven. This one is always slow.,0
"I went to McDonalds this morning for breakfast and got charged for an extra sandwich so I asked for a refund. they refunded the cheaper sandwich which was not the wrong one and I pointed it out and they said I was wrong and they refunded the right one, I was like okay whatever. then they closed to door to fix my drink. they apologize for my inconvenience, smile and tell me to have a nice day, handing over my drink. I get to work and realize they literally only filled it halfway. I was nothing but polite. Petty does not look good on you McDonalds.",0
Third time in a row to get the hamburger happy meal with just ketchup only to have cheese added each time.  My child will not eat it if cheese has touched it. They have new toys for the kids however we keep getting toys that are 6 months old. Not a good location for the lack of service and food.,0
"I went through the drive-thru and ordered 3 cheese burgers. I waited in line for like 10 minutes. I get to the window and they told me to park because my food wasn't ready. It wasn't even busy, so I didn't understand why it took so long to make 3 cheeseburgers. After waiting in my car for 10 more minutes, I went inside to get a refund since I had to go back to work and I just wasted 20 minutes waiting for food. As soon as I ask for a refund, one of the employees walks up with my food and hands it to me. I guess they forgot I was waiting on it? I will never come back to this location.",0
"The Staff is very rude! Me and My friend were gonna order sonething over the phone. as we were waiting for someone to answer the phone, Me and My friend were telling Jokes to each other. My friend told me a joke and someone answered the phone. we didn  anyone was on the line so he kept telling me The joke. so about of No where THE MANAGER tells my friend 폮top prank calling here or I퐉 Gonna call the cops and send them to your house, I have Your Number? My friend tried to Tell the Manager that he didn know someone was on the line. but the Manager decides that he isn퐓e calling this Place back unless the Manger apologizes for being rude!",0
"I hate it when I point out a problem and the management tell me that that's the way its supposed to be.  I managed a McDonald's for many years.  I know better. I still order their food regularly all over the country.  I know better. The new manager has made things much better, but standards still slip back to the old ways when he's not here.",0
"I usually defend fast food joints, even McDonalds. Not a very picky person. However this visit to this location was very disappointing. Defying all logic it took a very long time to get my food around noon on a Tuesday despite few cars. The employees were emotionless and seemed to be rushing you through, even though it still took a long time. And then to top it off they got my order wrong.",0
"This people always try to rush you on the drive through and even if you go inside store, there are always problems with food, last time I went over there I had 2 cold cheese burgers, had to wait for my wife's food and came the wrong way. If you want to eat bacon, tomato and onions good luck trying to find them in burgers, there are just 1 piece to none hahaha.",0
"Really frustrated with this location. I usually go to the location off of Beach street and order the same thing every time I go there. I know exactly how much my order should be. I stop here because I happened to be closer to this location than to my normal one and order my usual. 2 McDoubles. I had just enough change in my wallet to pay for my order. Or so I thought. Instead of paying $1.50  2 + .25 = $3.25, I was charged $1.99 for ONE Mcdouble. It may not seem like much, but to someone who is on the go and on a budget I expect ome of the biggest fast food chains to at the very least be consistent with their prices. I wonder how much I've over paid at this location in the past!
What made me most upset was that I didnt recieve a receipt for my order. So in order to determine why I paid $2.15 after tax for ONE Mcdouble, I went inside to the self ordering in the lobby and looked it up myself. I dont appreciate not being told my total at the speaker, not beinzing I didnt even receive one to begin with when I pulled forward from the pick up window. It should be standard procedure to give a receipt for the sake of the overpaying customers.",0
"Food was good. Everything was right, but they never have any of the toys offered on the mconalds preorder app exept for what they call inisex, which is really just for boys, and were very short with me and rude when i asked for a proper toy for my little 2 yr old daughter. She is obviously not into a avengers.",0
"If I could give them no stars I would.. they have been messing up my order for year's. Remodel didn't help nothing,  still sucks. I've complained to a district manager,  don't help. I've had 1 nice manager,  but she still got my order wrong... I swear at one point I thought I was on boiling point, or there was a hidden camera. Cuz they got my order wrong 3x's in s row... this place is A JOKE....",0
"Got the buttermilk chicken sandwich and not even sure if there was chicken. Bit untonit and had a cold grey semi solid mass caked in flavorless breading. Fries were soggy and unappealing. Usually no matter what Mcds you go to you expect some consistancy, with this one in Roanoke you can expect consistent bad food. Stay clear of this place. Staff definitely doesn't care and to say the food is subpar would be a compliment.",0
"They watered their parking lot with a poorly-engineered irrigation syztem right before days of hard freeze,let everyone skate through the ice for a day before closing during the majority of the freeze when everyone needed a hot meal.
Whataburger stayed open and served a limited menu to support Roanoke.",0
"This McDonalds sucks. They recently had a remodel which means the inside is nice and they have the fancy double drive-thru, but unfortunately the remodel could not fix the main issue with this McDonalds: The management.

The management is either not training employees properly or teaching them to bend the rules to keep a good drive-thru timer, because you will always have to pull up at this McD's. Always. Even for perfectly reasonable orders at perfectly reasonable times (1 burger + fry at 3pm = pull up next to the 3-4 other cars already there).

The one manager I've had the displeasure of dealing with was rude as well. I had to go back due to them forgetting several items on an order (that I had to pull up and wait for more than 5 minutes for, no less) and decided I just wanted it refunded to my card. The manager was rude about refusing to put it back on the card and insisting on giving me cash. The best part? He made me pull up to get the cash.

So again: Mis-managed, terrible McDonalds. It's a franchise for a reason, this one just stinks.",0
"Honestly, I hate to do this, but the moment I walked in, it smelled like a porta potty... and I was like ""let me just order"" I ordered 2 hot and spicy's NO LETTUCE, a large drink and a large fry. The Coke was ok, the fries like always (not full but fresh) and I got one sandwich with lettuce and one without. I told the kid in the front ""this sandwich has lettuce one it"" which prompted him to tell the guy and girl at the grill to please fix it... they shrugged their shoulders and pointed at the monitor and said ""well it only says one sandwich no lettuce...""

I mean come on guys. The kid at the register made an honest mistake and instead of going back and forth with him, just fix the dang sand which! Don't sit there and argue. So the guy in the back snatched the sand which and threw it! At that point I asked for a refund.. little did they know, I speak Spanish. So when the assistant manager asked me what happened I explained to her and she let out this LOOOONNGG sigh... so sorry I am an inconvenience to you, but if you were to train your team members some customer service this wouldn't have been an issue. Jesus, the kid at the register was really nice and well mannered. He gets a 5 star. But my experience was just horrible.",0
"They seemed overwhelmed at lunch in Drive thru. Very slow. Then when at window was asked to pull forward when simply ordering a number 2 with nothing special added? Seriously, a quarter pounder takes extra time to make? Now I remember why I dislike McDonalds.",0
"I come here every morning for breakfast on my way to work. Ever since they got the ""Angry Bird eyebrows chick"" workin the drive through my order is always wrong. Not a little wrong like very wrong! Today was a simple order of a Coke and a sausage biscuit with strawberry jam. But she trys to give me a Frappuccino. Then after I clarify what I ordered again I get a Dr pepper instead of a Coke and then grape instead of strawberry. This is a everyday occurrence when she is working the drive-thru window. I even have talked to the shift manger and he laughed it off. I cant wait for the new Mc Ds to open on 114 and 35!!",0
Crazy manager at this McDonald's abusing customers. I've never been to McDonald's THAT HAS YOUNG latin Manger yelling at customer. I was surprised as he hanging out the drive-thru window and people just driving away.,0
"God is love, but this McDonald don't have love. Manager are rude and not professional. I order my food instead of her thanking me I thank her.  That's something Jesus will do. I will pray for her tho. I just don't think it's a place to relax and enjoy your family time.",0
Absolute worst service. The manager has no control over her employees. Absolutely rude and unprofessional.,0
This place is the worst.  It smelled like manure.  I had to go to the counter like 3 times before the order was complete. Cold fries and burnt apple pies. I didnt like this olace at all.  Next birthday for my grandson will be somewhere else.,0
Very disappointed with this McDonald's! I ordered a crispy buttermilk chicken sandwich meal and supersize my order when I drove uo to the window I paid my total and then I sat there waiting for about 5 minutes so I said to myself maybe they're cooking a fresh chicken so I didn't mind the wait. Well when I got home I took the first bite on the sandwich and let me tell you THAT CHICKEN HAD BEEN SEATING ON THE HEAT PAN FOR A VERY LONG TIME BECAUSE IT WAS LITERALLY HARD LIKE A ROCK AND IT WAS NOT JUICY AT ALL IT WAS VERY DRY! and then the fries that I got were overcooked every single one of them were burnt!,0
"This is the worst McDonald's I've ever been to. I've tried it several times, mostly because it's on the way to my work...but after today, honestly, I'd rather skip breakfast all together. I got a completely soggy hash brown, soggy all the way around. I got a small caramel frappe with a shot of espresso. They put the espresso on the bottom and just poured the Frappe on top, so all I got was espresso when I first tried it. To add insult to injury, they put it in a small cup and dumped the rest out (it should have been in a medium cup). I worked at a McDonald's for over 2 years and this one does not follow procedures at all",0
"I used to go to this McDonald's every morning for breakfast. The customer service has gone to hell and they haven't gotten my order correct in the drive thru for 8 days in a row. No one speaks English well enough to complain, they just look at you and smile.",0
"This McDonald's screws up 96% of the time! Tonight was the last straw. My husband ordered 2 large fries, 2 PLAIN McChickens, and 2 large drinks.....The drinks were great.....the rest was not even what he ordered and OLD. In the bag was a fillet o fish (which to my surprise was the only fresh thing), 2 medium 5 year old fries, and 2- 10 year old cheeseburgers...seriously, the cheeseburgers were so old the cheese was crusting. Where is the quality????? They don't care if people are upset and/or get food poisoning?? Granted my husband should have checked the bag before leaving, but he didn't think to (not surprised). I was definitely upset the order was wrong and said whatever and we were going to eat it because we basically got smaller fries, but an extra sandwich, but those CHEESEBURGERS were so horrendous that whoever put that order together should be fired because it was just wrong..meat and cheese was well past shelf life and the pics I upload will show it. Way to go McDonald's for providing POOR SERVICE yet again.",0
Urger buns taxted stale. Fries were little more than broken potato sticks. Absolutely terrible location!,0
"Ew omg, the coke is so disgusting, it does not taste like coke, it taste so disgusting, and they take their time like i don't have a 30 minute lunch ",0
Took my 3 year old here to eat and play in the play place. There was a homeless man sitting in there with his no socks or shoes on. Multiple employees walked by him without saying anything,0
"What's with the weak coffee?! The McDonald's coffee usually has a great flavor, this morning its like dirty warm water, weak and diluted! During breakfast lunch, unacceptable!",0
"I've never had a good experience with any McDonald's I've ever been to, so I usually avoid McD if possible.  My only visit to this McDonald's in Roanoke messed up my order.  I had ordered 2 hamburgers with no mustard, fries and drink.  I get home only to discover that the hamburgers did not have ketchup and onions, but were instead covered in mustard.  Won't be back.",0
Drive thru lady is awful. The service was horrible,0
Girl taking orders in the drive through didn't listen very well. Asked for 2 hashbrowns it was never added to my order. I said it 3 times.,0
Today they see me inside waiting for orden and no body attend me today 7/22/21 time 6:27 am they look at me 3 time and don't ask can I help you..and the male manager he see me and ignore me..I like this mcdonal I'm the truck driver I coming every day but this male is not good..and  I left with hungry..!!!,0
This is the second time I've been to this McDonald's and waited longer than 10 minutes with no service. Went at 2pm no one in line no one in drive thru. #poorservice #lazystaff don't even realize they being photographed while sitting at their table,0
"Very dissappointed today. Sunday breakfast, understaffed, very very slow service. Customers had to ask for utensils, cream, etc with every order. Staff seemed to suffer from inadequate training and nobody seemed to be hustling.",0
Ordered a Big Mac with bacon didn't get the bacon on it. Fries were cold. And the gentleman inside was spitting in the trash can ill never go back again,0
The ladies restroom smell horrible. Moldy and mildew-y smell. Very very strong smell that I could smell through my mask.,0
This location had me pull up to a number lane and wait for my food and NEVER CAME with it!! wth!!,0
Charged me for someone else who already drove offs meal. Then got my order wrong. Spent 20 minutes for fast food in the drive thru,0
"Order some food and they forgot to give me , my Cheeseburgers... I always check the bag before I leave. I told them and the girl said it was in there...I told her you want to come and check...",0
"The service at this McDonald's is always spotty, this time they made my iced latte a hot latte not a big deal but they consistently mess up the orders and I love McDonalds in general",0
We go to this McDonalds because they had a really cool electronic board that the kids could play on it was interactive and very neat well for the last five times they tell us the board is broke.. we only get a drink there I'm so we only go to for the play area and since it's broke my son has been very sad,0
17 minutes in the drive thru. . . ..just wow.. had the order incorrect at the pay window. . .food was extremely hot so that was nice.,0
The manager did not have all the equipment working the order was messed up and they did not have the option to do Google or Apple pay or take credit cards or scan anything on the McDonald's app.,0
"Twice I ordered the quarter pounder deluxe meal and when I get back to work to eat, no lettuce and tomatoes.  Come on!!",0
I walk into the store in Roanoke TX and the employee is sitting on the counter and leaning on the cups with his but touching them I wonder where else he's been sitting at maybe where the food is made.,0
"There worse ! Wet lettuce  or dead.
Fries or nasty burnt dried up 5.00 Sunday Sept 25.  Made attempt  to call management  but kept  hanging  up there phone. This restaurant  needs to shut down.",0
How do you miss a patty on a big mac? -_- First time going there too.,0
Horrible customer service. Manager is a very unhappy person who obviously does not want to be there.,0
Flavorless grease bombs. This chain in general has gone down hill in a big way.,0
Rude on the drive thru speaker and at the window the only postive was the person who  gave me my food. She was very kind and polite to me.,0
Sat in the drive thru for about 15 to 20 min because they were very busy and still got very cold food. Took the fries back. Very disappointed.,0
I was told to pull forward and park so I did and I waited for 30 minutes and when I went in to ask about my food they said they forgot about me. I got a refund and left.,0

Ordered a 4pcs chicken nugget happy meal for my daughter. Drive thru worker never asked if I wanted chocolate milk or apple juice and never asked what kind of sauce I wanted for the nuggets. Smh! I'm sorry but a kids happy meal shouldn't cost no more than 5 dollars not no 7 dollars! Smh twice,0

"They did not give me my complete order, I made 3 order  of chicken deluxe and my order was missing fries whet back to made a complain and they were yelling at me and husband, this is not fear to the customer.

"There was an excruciating 15 minute wait time for two simple breakfast sandwiches, and the place was empty. When checked, the sandwiches were actually missing the cheese.
While waiting, some filthy guy was exchanging $80 in singles for twenties. After he got done with his banking transaction, he actually spun around and walked right into me- talk about the bum rush!!
The true danger here, though, is when you try to enter. There is a welcome sign at the curb directing cars to enter into a single lane driveway where the drive-thru actually exits. A head-on collision waiting to happen.
Stay far away from this place.",0
"Very bad service, I don't recommend to go there. 30 minutes waiting for a order and nobody say nothing.",0
I ordered a Big Mac meal sized medium and a 10 pc; I got a double cheeseburger and actually 5 McNuggets. Got robbed for nearly 10 dollars. Never again.,0
They are very rude and have no respect for people they yell at you like you did something wrong then the make you wait for your order then they get the order wrong and the best part nobody there speaks any English burger King for me,0
"Terrible service through the drive by. They threw out food into the bag and it isn't the first time. I use to come here alot as a kid, but growing up it got worse. I hope their employees can have better customer service. And don't throw food everywhere.",0
Customer service is the worst! So unprofessional every time. Lunch menu is up and when I asked for a kids meal they said they only had breakfast! And their excuse was that the menu change by itself! They don give you your complete order all the time (always missing something)they rushed,0

Incorrect hours!!!  I arrived at 5:52 in the morning and was informed that they still closed,0
Horrible service from the night shift manager .!! I would also love to speak to a distric manager.!,0
As a frequent customer of this McDonald I am furious that you have your workers working under a heat wave with no type of air conditioning. I walked in to order with my kids and had to take my order to the car and eat in car which was very uncomfortable with 4 kids bet way better than eating in a place where it was difficult to breath. If you treat your employees like this than this is the reason your customer service in this locate is poor. As a franchise you shouldn be involved in this type of business never the less in any type of customer service business. I will not be returning to this location as my money is worth more to other busine,0
"Number of times we've ordered from this McDonalds: 3
Number of times they've gotten the order right: 0

It cannot be spelled out any clearer. ""Quarter pounder. Absolutely nothing on it. No cheese. Just the meat and the bun."" It is so simple. Under normal circumstances I would stick around for them to get it right. But they have a steady supply of drugged out homeless people begging for money right there in the drive through line, so running that gauntlet a second time is downright dangerous.

So I get home to see if i can salvage this order. Pull the bun all the way off to start scraping fake cheese off of it. The stale, burned bun breaks (picture). I successfully scrape the cheese product off the top only to find there's another slice of fake cheese underneath the patty as well.

I give up. #FightFor15, indeed",0

"I went through one of the drive thru lanes last night, and waited for about 15 minutes as they only took orders from the other lane. I was not able to back up my car, so I went forward to ask what was up. When I got to the only window open, they said they were only taking orders from one side. I suggested they put up a sign, and asked if could take my order at the window, they said I would have to go through the drive thru again. I am not going here anymore for this, in addition to the times they got my order wrong.",0

This Mc Donald is ran poorly. The management is nasty and they ignore paying customers. They leave the register to a guy that also has to take both in store and drive way orders. The fries sit out all day. I came home to cold frozen,0
OMG!!!  Last time I order 3 double cheeseburger  they look like they were sitting there for hours. So this time I ask the girl that I want my burgers fresh so they come up with the brilliant idea of putting the burgers and the fries in the microwave so they would be nice hot and fresh,0
This place is not good at all the manager Had an attitude when I went with my mom and a few friends we ordered our milkshakes and fries and when my mom friend asked for barbecue sauce and ketchup she realized that she wanted ketchup and buffalo sauce so she asked the manager and the manager said and I quote ?Which one is it? Then my mom friend looked up and said buffalo and ketchup I guess,0
This McDonald's is just wow. Some days you get good food the majority of times is just bad food. I ordered a big mac meal from them. When i got it the bread was old hard like it's been sitting there forever. The nuggets were old. Awful customer service. The majority of staff are pretty much children. There's no type of discipline or order in this place. If you don't like your job just quit it's that simple. But we're paying alot of money for service like this that's just obserred. This place needs new staffing management everything.,0
"My children find a dead mouse. I requested to speak with the supervisor.....made her aware of the situation.....She HAD THE NERVE TO TELL ME THAT SOMEONE (IMPLYING MAYBE ONE OF MY KIDS) MUST HAVE JUST PUT IT THERE.

I call the location to try to see what happened to my food and they kept putting me in hold, saying that they both checked my order and that everything was in the bag, did not try to help me at all and said and i quote ?my manager on the floor said they checked everything and that everything is in the bag?I was in disbelief that they wouldn even try to do anyt",0

I ask someone if they could take my order and she ask the other cashier to take my order the other cashier totally ignored me. If they don want to take care of walk in customer then they should close the lobby I had to walk aw,0
One of the worst with service. I ordered a ice latte through the app for pickup. So I go inside I wait at pickup. Drink isnt ready and other people are waiting also. I mentioned to the solo employee I had a pickup order. She says ok then goes off to make other peoples meals. So I try to be patient stood there for like 20min and never received my drink. They never canceled my drink I left and was still charged for it. Also they never sent the 1 cashier who was struggling by herself no help.,0
That's just the worst McDonald's I have been to They have a lady there working at the  Drive-through window who have a real bad attitude And she also speak with bad languages She curses to my wife and also curses to all the people who went through the drive-through I did not see her name what she's the one taking the orders late at night You must have been 11 o'clock PM When we went to McDonald's but I will never in my life go back to that place to spend my  My hard working money,0
"They didn't take the order properly.  I ordered a cheeseburger meal with coffee. When I got to the pickup window they'd placed the order as coffee and cheeseburger only.  When I asked for the corrected order and was preparing to pay the difference they tried to charge me DOUBLE THE PRICE OF THE ORIGINAL MEAL.  AND ASKED ME TO PAY A TOTAL OF $8.00 and change.  I asked for the manager (Maria) who refused to give me her last name OR explain how adding fries fir a combo would cost me double the price of the entire order....

"A few days ago my boyfriend went to this mcdonald's to get us something to eat. I was excited, had just came home from a long day at work and was STARVING!!! Ready to eat, I took a bite, thought nothing of it, I then took another bite and look to see that I bit into a VERY PINK QUARTER POUNDER!!!!! So I grab my food, go to this mcdonald's and show them my burger was pink. They proceed to apologise and gave me a new one, I ask for gloves so I may examine this one. I do and find that this burger is pink as well, so now this is 2 pink burgers in total given to me. I tell them, they go ahead and apologize and gives me another... And yes, you guessed it, a third pink burger!!!!!! So at this point of course I am very much disgusted and appalled by their lack attentiveness of the food they are distributing to the point I ask another customer next to me if he had seen what I did.... I didn't want to feel as if I was picking but he agreed, he saw pink, so I finally asked for a refund and fresh fries and left. I will not support this mcdonald's again!

Possibly the worst McDonald's on the planet. Can never get anything right and staff act as if there's nothing wrong.,0

Always a long line. The kids working the drive thru are always in a bad mood. Orders get mixed up and the fries toddle between not being fresh to being freshly made in old oil... I will stop there...",0

No napkins? Make you wait at the other side of restaurant  for 10 mins from drive thru? Then have to go inside and ask for condiments and a straw? Get it together management is not run right!,0
The apple pies here were the worst. It was like biting into a regular apple. The only thing cooked was the outside. The inside was cold and the apples were hard. I went there 12/26/18 to get happy meals for my daughters and their fries were too hard to eat. I won't be going back there. I only went to reward the girls for cleaning their room and helping around the house for 2 weeks. (This was their choice of reward for good behavior),0

"With as much staff as was on hand there is no reason I should have waited longer than 30 minutes, but I did.
I was not happy with my order when I got it.
Nor was my body satisfied when it went down.

Literally the worst McDonalds ever . Food always cold.  Staff is all illegal and no help from them about asking about promotions always busy both inside and drive thru have plenty of workers but somehow always a long wait . Rude workers even if you call asking about promotions they always hang up . Even with all that said they still have the same stingy services with uber eats . Cold half cooked food go somewhere else save your money.,0
"For the third day, I went to this McDonalds, which I frequently always come to this McDonalds, my daughter and my niece love McDonalds, so each time I place my order, I ask for a medium fries  with my additional order, and for the three days that I went, they were given me burnt fries.  I'm sorry but I paid a lot for my order to begin with, I'm not excepting burnt fries, especially three days in a row. Each time I asked for some new fries, and then they would give me good fries that were not burnt. Except for yesterday, I got my money back.  I ask the girl why was she giving me burnt fries, and her reply was that they didn't change the oil in which they cooked the fries in. The point is as a customer you don't have to keep excepting burnt fries, or anything that doesn't look right to you. You are already spending so much money to begin with ,to be getting burnt fries. Lately there's been lots of issues with this McDonalds, people have attitudes, don't have manners, they don't even say hi  or thank you for coming. I'll be taking my service elsewhere. No customer service.",0
Arguably one of the most incompetent branches of McDonald's that I've ever had the displeasure of going to. I spent 20 minutes waiting on a mobile order when I could have easily gone through the drive-thru and gotten it in 5. Absolutely ridiculous.,0
Their food taste like plastic. Very unsatisfied with them. They used to be good. But now it's like they don't care if the food is fresh or not.,0
Absolutely horrible! Not sure who the owner is but they should definitely get a new staff and get Mcdonald corporate to come in for training. The service is bad and so is the food. They give you what they want not what you pay for especially as it gets closer to closing time. Food should be available and fresh no matter how close it is to closing. Workers should understand that if they dont wanna work let somebody who wants to do the job. Not suprised at the amount of negative reviews but I am suprised that ownership and management does not take these reviews into consideration. Complete disgrace! Go a little further in bellevi,0

"It's absurd how bad the service is here. I wouldn't recommend going through the drive through. They'll mess up your order and then make you wait a long time for it again. I'd say just ignore this McDonald's entirely but if you do come to this location, do yourself a favor. Park the car and order your meal inside the fast food restaurant. It'll be faster this way.",0
Really bad service.... Food was cold... And large fries wasn't even full.... Probably size of a medium... Have to do better,0
Every time i have gone there they have not listened and messed up my order. One of the worst mcdonald to go to here in newark other than the one in downtown (w,0
"Their iced tea tasted like water with a splash of tea so it tasted disgusting. I ordered a meal and they forgot the fries. And lastly, the girl at the counter had the worst attitude problem like it was killing her to God forbid do her job. If you come here, make sure all of your stuff is in the bag because they just hate their jobs there obviously.",0
"**CHECK BEFORE LEAVING DRIVE THRU**
This place sucks always. The people on the intercom are arrogant and impolite. They always forget an item at the drive thru. Hate them but its the only place that is closest to me. The only reason i go there bcs my son just wants the happy meal so i have no choice.",0
The young lady working the driv thru this morning is sooo lucky im not the person i used to be just 7 years ago...besides the nasty attitude after her mistake the cashier proceeded to lie to the the useless manager Carla that looked almost terrified to address the situation ..karma young lady ...ill see you again,0
worst location ever! EVERY SINGLE TIME they screw up my order - and the customer service sucks! They퐎,0
Too much waiting seems like the staffs don't know how a fast food restaurant suppose to be run. On top of the wait they forget items that you pay for so make sure to ask for a receipt if something not right with this McDonalds please report it call and complain.,0
"Extremly slow. They need to have a better service this is ""fast food"". Have been waiting too long to order. They are not bad but they need to move faster. Not the firts time i come here always lije that even when they dont have nobody inside.",0
"Not Satisfied, after buying 3 Large orders of fries for $11.97 and was given large containers SERIOUSLY HALF FULL looking like Small or Medium sized fries. Very disappointed...",0
"This place I really dont recomend it if you are looking a fast service, deliciuse Chickennuger, and Fries. I dont see Macdonal is do en the fries as before, soft, salty, and hot. Everytime we whent there to give more chances to the place my fiance always end with his stomach sick. When that happened for the third time I said, "" Nop, we are not buy anymore in the Mcdonals, no icecream, chickennuger, or fries. Thank you for reading, this is Doll in a Restaurant. Shalom 占쏙",0
Can not even 1 star it was a horrible experience do two employees service took me a half hour just in line waiting through the drive thru then I heard a voice come over the loudspeaker and says drive to the window when I go to drive through the window that was for cars in front of me and the line did not move the worst visit I had to McDonalds drive throw,0
"i asked a lady to open the bathroom, and with a really bad attitude she said that it was only for customers, when I told her I WAS in fact a costumer, she replied with a 퐋nly for buying costumers?I responded ",0
It's my local McDonald's so I wish I could rate it higher especially considering they added modern stuff like the DIY menu boards and the 2nd drive thru lane. But what's the point of a second drive thru lane if your employees just ignore it like what happened tonight. Also while they have security inside the pan handlers in the drive thru lanes at night are out of control. Food wise things take a long time usually but it's your normal McDonald's type food except they don't salt their fries well.,0
Bad service long wait  employees are the worst,0
"This McDonald's has always been bottom-of-the-barrel as far back as I can remember, and a sleek face-lift doesn't change the fact that a visit to this McDonald's will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. The list of their offenses is too long to detail every one, so I'll compile a list:
1. Incorrect orders 50% of the time
2. Rude employees and managers
3. Customers who are loud, offensive, and downright violent
4. Poorly made, slapped-together food

And perhaps the most disgusting new violation is that recently they claim to have leased their parking lot to a private booting company, P.B.S. Parking Boot Service, and troll the parking lot for people who step off the property to boot them and demand $200 cash in exchange for the boot removal. It seems this McDonald's is doing everything to lose business. They thrive off of convenient location alone. Absolutely terrible experience.",0
Every time I go I don't get what I ask  and the some employee are mean,0
"Always rude people in the afternoons or evenings, no sense of respect for others. Overcooked old food is served late afternoons to early in the evening. Completly discusting. Overall not a good place. Needs myor improvement on employees.",0
They can't get Uber eats orders right this is the third and last time it will happen again. They completely forgot 4 medium fries .,0
"All those renovations in appearance makes no difference if the staff is unprofessional and simply ghetto. Then again it is in Newark smh. I was not aware that this particular Mc Donald's was not a corporate store, honestly I wouldn't know how to differentiate one from the other. In any case to my understanding every Mc Donald's ran the same policy in regards to the food they sell, obviously. So when I go to get my coffee, everyone knows you are entitled for one free refill but to my surprise this Mc Donald's does not honor that. The person at the register who's name is Estella (mexican woman) was the one who took my order and made me feel real uncomfortable and awkward when I asked politely for my refill. There were others on line waiting to take their order and I feel like she deliberately embarrassed me. There was no need to make me feel degraded, at the end of the day I am a customer and I have no need to bring my business here. I should of took my business where I noramlly go which is the one located on Washington Ave, in Belleville. That just goes to show you how true the phrase is, ""Never judge a book by it's cover""!",0
this place is suck!!!!!!!! i had a delivery of doordash which i had to place but they didnt accomodate with me!! they were like thats for belville nj store!!!!!!! it was very frustrating at 10pm. then i had to go for belville store then couldnt find out. then i went back to the same one and got the order.,0
Very rude staff nasty attitude  I understand  people not happy with their job  but that dobt give them the right to be nasty..,0
If only I could give less than 1 star!!! I swore off McDonalds long ago however I happened to be with someone who stopped in so I decided to get a breakfast sandwich thinking it would be hard to go wrong with breakfast... I got food poisoning for the first time in my 29 years of LIFE. A quite unwelcome reminder to stay far away..,0
The worst McDonald I have been to. Waited at the pick up window for awhile to be served ,0
"The day workers are very rude and disrespectful especially the girl who takes the order , I had the worst experience ever .",0
"This McDonald's is HORRIBLE. PERIOD. The food is always cold,fries soggy , nuggets soggy... And if you ask for sauce make sure you got it cause even if you paid the 50cent FEE you still might not have gotten it....",0
"They are advertising the new crispy chicken sandwich meal for $6, yet lied twice, once saying it was a mobile order, which is a lie, I took a pic, second that it didn't start, so why advertise, so sad, worse customer service in Mcdonald's",0
The employees at this location are ridiculously lazy. It's 6pm and the drive-thru menu is still on the breakfast side. It shouldn't take more than 2 minutes to flip the menu over to the lunch side.,0
"THIS PLACE IS A DISGRACE. THE WOMEN THAT WORK IN THIS PLACE ARE THE VERY LOW OF THE LOW. SERVICE IS SUPER SLOW, THE RESTAURANT IS SUPER DIRTY. AHH AND IF YOU GO IN THERE WITH YOU MAN KEEP HIM VERY CLOSE TO YOU, THIS WOMEN SPECIALLY THE MANAGER HER NAME IS GABRIELA WILL FLIRT WITH YOUR MAN GET HIS NUMBER AND YOU KNOW THE REST. THE WORST OF THE WORST. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST THE WORSE MCDONALD'S IN JERSEY. WHAT MAKES THIS MCDONALD'S BAD IS THE EMPLOYEES AND THE WAY THE HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THE COSTUMER. AVOID AVOID AVOID...",0
"Rude!! They close early without saying anything. They don't close 4 am they close 9. I waited at the drive thru for 15 min no answer , someone was back there just ignore the drive thru.",0
Very slow  they do mobile orders last even when you pay in app. They make you wait if go inside .,0
"Mobile order 30 mins ago. Came in once the app said pick up.

Counter: oh we just got your order. Wait longer.

2020 Logic",0
One of the worst McDonald's franchies around. Orders are often messed up even when given face to face. This branch is one of the few I go out of my way to avoid now.,0
I wish i can put 0 stars. The service here was so so horrible! SMH I don,0
Its incredible that a business like McDonalds can't fix things so simple like this drop ceiling....water damage with a lil bit of humidity could potentially become mold...something that could be harmful to anyone walking in here...,0
This is the worst ever too slow they are always on their cell phones instead of helping the customers. They almost always get my order wrong. When i went there bathroom was flithy .,0
Worst employees I guess it was manager at night shift very rude not surprised why people are giving negative reviews,0
I went in to use the bathroon before i go buy some thing and i saw i had to be  Buzz Inn so I went to the front to have me  to be buzzed in and I was told no I had to buy something first and the funny thing is I'm a diabetic and my sugar was high and I was in pain but I had to buy something first just to be let into the bathroom then when I was let into the bathroom it was so disgusting Know one clean the bathroom the toilet was filled with toilet paper and piss all over the rim of the toilet dry on u can see it and the manager that I'm assuming she had like a Jamaican accent and gave me kind of a nasty attitude also i wouldnt  recommend it  to come here and i was  visiting from upstate New York it was a long drive,0
"I travel a lot and MacDonald is my regular restaurant, and this is th worst ever place in customer service and food handlers.",0
"They are the worst.  Poor customer service, food taste horrible",0
Couldn't get a simple order correct so had to wait.,0
If I could give negative stars I would. I orders a number 3 large with no pickles and a coke no ice. Apparently that was like rocket science for these morons.,0
Very slow,0
"Terrible, I'm sitting in the 2 lane drive thru for 3 to 5 minutes & another car pulls in the other lane & they take his/her order 1st then have the nerve to tell me to hold on a minute. Broadway McDonald's North Newark.",0
They  hardly speak English they serve you Whit and attitude and they are always more concentrated in talkin about fellow workers that they are to take your order and that's why they always give you the wrong stuff.,0
The worstest McDonald's in all of America and they have a armed guard always nonsense there  cold food stale and hard nerve no sauces always mistake orders too many foreign immigrants work there drive thru  Is an half an hour late junkies asking you for money and Brittany is a chickenhead.,0
"The staff is rude and there no diversity in the staff.
I live in the n",0
They hire unprofessional people who can't even speak proper English. The workers are always forgetting something in your order. Ohh and the ice cream never works!,0
This store always gice me a hard time I don't like the staff at all,0
"The absolute worst McDonald in New Jersey , r",0
There are better McDonald locations then here. Usually 9 out of 10 times they forget something you ordered.,0
"They never give you what you order, and the food seems to be old and bad tasting.",0
Today was given double quarter cheese burger and it was not fully cooked.i dont like to complain but this was not good at all especially my fruit punch was watery .wouldnt go back here again.i prefer belleville,0
Person taking orders through the drive thru has the worst attitude ever .,0
"Wait time was horrible, food was cold as usual and the drive thru a always feels like a death trap.",0
I was served raw food. I rarely ever go to McDonald's but when I do it is full of regrets.,0

Not a good place to go and spend your money very bad place they over charge customers and have no professional people working there very rude and think they are doing you a favor will never go there again,0
"Worst place.. drive thru is even worst. Their machines are never working. They take your order, make you wait in line, just to tell you at the pay window that sorry their machine is not working.",0
If I could I would rate this negative 1000 they had such bad service food is cold and when you come back because they forgot something they argue with you.,0
"I just came and half of the
Crew was hanging out side the counter, they talk too loud and speak in a very bad way ( n words and Bi.!.!:!)  words is a shame the place is pretty but a has a poor crew.",0
"Very slow service, and people were coming back in complaining their orders were wrong.",0
McDonald's. Ordered twice and twice my order was canceled Noone bothered to let me know just wasted time waiting for nothing.,0
Just watched one of the workers eat some of my french fries before he put it on my tray can,0
"Rude people as cashiers, slow service, annoying employees. I reccomend you go to Burger King, the employees are much nicer, and the food is overall better.",0

They do something weird with your food be careful everyone,0
Food was alright staff seemed too busy with their own pastimes rather then getting food and drinks out. Saw one employee sweep four times in the same spot while three customers were waiting on drinks. I'd only recommend if it's your last option.,0

Never going back there again.",0
the big gurl in drive thru with tattoos and piercings is so rude like she has an attitude for every little thing. she rolls her eyes at everything u tell her and is always huffin and puffin. and talking back with an attitude. like today i had asked her for my receipt and she said you퐇l get it ?and rolled her eyes and closed the window. and then gave it to me before i left. like the first time i thought she was having ,0
"From the moment I pulled up after ordering literally had ZERO words spoken to me by the drive thru guy. He just gave me dirty looks. Then after taking my credit card he took his cell phone out looking like he was stealing my credit card information. I asked for my receipt which was given with a hateful look but still no words. I called MULTIPLE times and left multiple messages before I got a call back from a person stating they were the manager. They said they pulled the video and he was just texting no picture. He could be texting my credit card info. I still don't feel comfortable with this and my card is still frozen. Mcdonalds once they take my card is accepting responsibility for any fraud /theft and PCI DSS compliance. If their employee did in fact steal my CC I am filing criminal charges against the employee and McDonalds for not being PCI and PII compliant. The auditor in me will not allow this.

Don go eat here they will take about 6 minutes to cook your frozen apple pie then drag their feet till they feel like it to give the order to you . I paid at the counter at 4:03pm and got my order ,0
"I went in and ordered at a kiosk to go , I got a medium caramel frappe and a mcextreme bacon sandwich.
While waiting in line , I heard the kitchen staff say there is no sauce for the extreme, should we give it to them anyway? With no intentions of me hearing .
When my order came out, no one informed us there was no sauce , didnt ask us when making it if we still wanted it , another sandwich or my money back ..
I told them I heard them and they denied it , then said that they told someone else to let me know there was missing items for the sandwich . But she didnt , (I could hear them) and why would she make it without confirmation if she DID tell someone to ask ??
I also noticed there was 2 tomatoes instead of 3 that i paid extra for, same goes for the pickles I asked extra for .
I got a male employees attention and told him , hey this isn't correct...etc. he hot an attitude , rolled his eyes turned his back on me to continue what he was doing previously .
The only saving grace was a lady named Elyce , someone who I thought was a manager but she is only a crew member.
She intervened, corrected my order . The only one who helped . She deserves a raise// a reward . Thank you .

P.s. the lobby is dirty . Take some time to clean the tables",0

Had enough waiting and walked out.

Worst coffee latte in my life?Please just stop it take it out of menu it is worst. My cup ended up in a trash aft,0
Absolutely the most dirty restaurant I've seen in my life!! Every table this was Absolutely ridiculous. Trash food every square inch. I took mine to go and was scared to eat who's knows what kitchen would look like. NASTY!!!!,0
"Tried the McPlant for the first (and last) time. Would have been better eating an actual plant. Good thing they drown it in mayo and ketchup or it wouldn't have had any taste at all. The fries were warm at best and had been sitting there for awhile. I'm gonna stick with Burger King for my plant based burger, plus they have onion rings.",0
I have been in this area for about 5 months now. I have never went to this McDonalds and everything  in my order where correct. It either you don't get everything or you get everything and something is physically wrong with the food. Today I did a mobile order for pickup. My fries where literally half cooked and that in the box where half the fries where missing. It seemed like they dipped the fries in the cooking oil for two minutes then put them straight into the box. I never get sweet tea even thats what I always order.Also if you are looking for any hospitality or customer services don't hold you breathe. Sometimes I g,0
"I don't think I have ever had such a rude attitude for  a drive through worker. I waited and waited while I was the only one in the drive through. When I finally said hello to catch their attention   was yelled at with the words one second. Then finally time to order I was asked ""what do you want"" . So I said well hello.. first, and I would like a .. and proceeded with the order. No total was given but  was told ""move forward"". No please or thank you. So I asked do you always talk like that to customers? No answer. So I drove right through. Never again.",0
Very UNPROFESSIONAL!! I ordered from my phone as I have the apps for any food place. I asked my husband to go and pick up as I am working from home. He arrived at this location and he went to give them the code and they said they could not fulfill my order since my phone was not at the restaurant! Absolutely preposterous service. My husband said they were very rude about the while thing. I have never had this problem before as I have ordered several other times and never had to show them my phone. I do not even see on the app where it says it is required to bring your phone. .,0
"We just had the worst experience at this location. We asked if they had the peppermint coffee for the holidays, the woman responded with 퐕eah?.., I asked another question, no response, then she barks back 퐃ot or cold?as I was asking my son what he wanted she once again barked 퐃ot or cold",0

I know McDonald's isn't known for customer service but this place is beyond rude. It's a 24/7 location drove up to order... nothing no response.  Went inside the gas station and walked in.  The grill chick looked at me after standing there a few mins.. I said excuse me.  She looked at me then turned around and hid behind a stainless Steele shelf for a min. Another min later Said hello once again... no acknowledgement. FINALLY three people come out from the back... another min or so someone finally acknowledges me... rudely... food was burnt and to top it off i got food poisening!,0
Food getting bland...service good... atmosphere a bit outdated,0
Missing 1 large French Fries. Wrong honey mustard instead of sweet and sour (had to pay 10 cents per sauce packet. Very slow service. The slow service might be that more time is put into closing the bag with tape than it takes to prepare the food. The only reason they get any stars is because they were super polite.,0
"So I ordered from door dash.  All my French fries were missing and I have 5 children all the sundaes and McFlurrys were missing.  I called door dash and got credit for the missing items but as those of you know you don get dash fee and delivery fee and tip credit when the items missing so I lost that money.  I reordered all the missing items which included 3 Oreo McFlurrys,2 fudge sundaes and one Carmel.  I received 2 sundae and 1 McFlurry.  Get door dash credit again but again loading the fees and tip.  I try and call the store so the manager could at least talk to the parties who were making and packing and checking the order and tell them just be careful and pack everything on the receipt. Just read it and check it. But no first 3 calls it rang a few times and went to message that this store can answer calls anymore. It late it not rush hour at  care is taken to ensure the quality of the food they put out.  Very disappointed in this store. ",0
They need to hire real English speakers. It took me 10+ minutes to explain my order. Then my fries were so cold they must have prepared them last night. I had to go back inside and wait another 10 minutes to get them replaced. Meanwhile my burgers were getting cold. There were 2 Mexicans ladies working the front and drive thru who seamed to be conversing and unbothered by THE customers in the lobby. The Mexican man in the back was the only one working hard. I don't know if anyone else was English speakers or not but all I saw was 4-5 Mexicans working at noon. Photos included. Management or owners need to periodically check to see if their restaurant is to standards.,0
"I've been there twice. My order was completely messed up both times. The first time they offered to make the missing burger and make fresh fries. I waited 20 min before I said, I want my food or my money now. I got my burger and the same fries she took from me 20 min ago. I watched them screw up order after order while spending time playing and flirting. Horrible place. Needs real management. Not management trying to get into their co workers pants.",0
"This is THE WORST MacDonald's I have ever visited. First thing I noticed. Four white customers standing in line and the black customers being served their meals. The BLACK manager custom made their sweet teas, reassured them that ""all you have to do is ask for me and I'll """"have your back"""". They left more than happy. Meanwhile the untrained cashier cannot prioritize drink expediting. When one of the white customers asked the manager to assist, the manager just looked at him and turned around. In response, that white customer left very angry before ordering. After witnessing this obvious display of racism towards whites, another white couple simply walked out without ordering. Finally I ordered my meal. A Big Mac meal. It took five minutes to expedite my meal. The black manager yelled out my number, dropped the bag that contained my meal on the counter and turned and left. No thank you, no reassurance that I was pleased, nothing. I then waited 10 MINUTES for my large Coke!!!!!! The cashier, who is responsible for making drinks, didn't know how to get more ice or restock the large cups. To top",0
"THE WORST MCDONALD'S I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!!!!
I went there to order breakfast sandwiches for my crew to show them some appreciation for there hard work. I ordered 20 breakfast sandwiches to get to job location and count 15 only in the bags. I had to waste my time and gas to go back and get the rest for my crew.  They should really double check there orders before handing them out. Also they are rude and unprofessional!!! You tell them the situation and they look at you like it's your fault and dont even apologize for any inconvenience they have caused you. Someone from corporate really needs to go clean house at this location. As I am writing this I can also see all the other bad reviews about this location. That's gotta say a lot about the GM running this store and his employees. 占쏙",0
"It's unfortunate that after today,  I'll be going to the McDonald's on Beach. 3yrs here, 7 days a week I order a large mocha.   I've seen the management change about 7 people and I've made some friends.
All those people are gone. I made a direct complaint recently because I've had enough,  you'd think I'd go to a different McDonald's with ""that ""many issues right? Well, I don't think I should have had to drive further for their lack of customer service, but...its not changing. My complaint was handled fast and efficient. I come to retrieve my mocha and it tasted weird, a couple of days ago. I came back and was asked to park in 3 for it to be re made. I then gave it back to the lady and told her to please let the manager know I wasn't satisfied with the drink, we both laughed and she said ok.
Yesterday, I waited an hr because it was raining crazy...for a doordash. They gave the wrong item first and I had to reorder.
Today I go, and retrieve my mocha again, and the manager ask me how many were promised to me? I let her know,  the last one I came back and returned and told the girl somethings wrong with it,  it's taste burnt.  The gm says , I saw you yesterday and I know I gave you a free mocha. To me...that is calling me a liar. Especially when you repeat it after I tell you ,I didn't come yesterday,  I doordashed and yall messed that up. I also have dash receipts to show.
She then says I didn't call you a liar, but I know I gave you a free one. She then tells me her staff shared that I drive up without ordering. No. Have you ever experienced that? I'm here daily! When I told her her staff isn't at the window, just as she wasn't when I pulled up*today*  she said something was wrong with the speaker...No, accept some accountability.  The last manager told me she was Rosa and that's not the same lady I complained on. Anywho,  I told her I'm not the problem and I'm not sure why this hasn't been fixed yet,  but today I've decided to switch locations. lol drive further for good customer service, Rosa, thank you for at least responding today.

#LargeahotMocha",0
Very slooowww service. Just about any time I show. They send you to the waiting spot # 2 for 10 minutes for 2 chicken nuggets happy meals and 2 chicken sandwich. This happens often. I will go to a different McDonald's.,0
"This particular location is by far starting to be the worst in alliance! Their fries are always cold they sweet tea is nasty and the burgers are ""warm"" last week was our last time going to this location. We've found a better one",0
Management is  rude  went in to order some food young lady a register was taking my order when the manager comes over a tries to hand me a mask. When informed that i have a condition the keeps me from wearing one she rudely informed me  they would have to void my order and cant serve  me.  So loving that i can't  get food without  a mask and i drive a truck.,0
Same reason as before there was a rubberband in my food rapper and dirt on my bun,0
"I just went here 20 minutes ago it took very long i never got my receipt, ordered 40 chicken nuggets and didn't give me any sauces after specifying I wanted ranch buffalo and bbq when i asked her for sauce she handed me 4! Not only that she didn't hand me my money right and made my $5 dollar bill drop on the ground she was a young Lady with orangy yellow hair. Each Night is the same. This mcdonalds has horrible workers and horrible customer service!",0
"The lady who took my order was on her phone. She missed my order. Had to order again to the manager and he was speaking rude. The lady who gave me the remaining order literally threw it onto the table, rolled her eyes over. Not a good experience.",0
"042321 Tried them again in a rush and was insulted with a terrible attitude because I added a tea to my order, then she walked away with my credit card, the large cup had black finger prints marks on it, and gave me a scorched and cold egg Mcmuffin sandwich. The hashbrown was also greasy!

I ordered a bacon McGriddle w/o cheese, hash brown and a senior coffee. She thanked me and stated my cost. When it wasn't aligned with normal cost, I had to ask if I would do better ordering it as a meal. That reduced the price very nicely, but made me wonder why my server didn't at least offer to check the price to help me. Then, I decided if I'm paying for my cheese, I'll take it on the side. When I got my order, the bacon and the hash brown were just so loaded with grease! The sandwich was messier, sweet dough (yuk) and the hash brown soaked through the bag! I know McDonald's serves fast food, but this made me feel like a heart attack was going to happen if I ate it! I rarely stop at McD but I was running and hadn't eaten. The experience reminded me, they are not emergency food, they are emergency room food.",0
"Poor service. They were super busy and took the orders pretty fast, but they didn't make my order. I waited 15 minutes for 6 nuggets and a small fry. After several other orders that were placed after me were served I asked about mine and the lady handing out orders  just brushed me off. I just asked for a refund instead, which was a lot quicker. Thanks for wasting my time. Ronald wouldn't not be happy, not happy at all!",0
"The manager himself throws fries inside the to go bag, maybe 10 in the container and the rest all loose in the bag. Has a salty attitude and highly unqualified position. Not a good front for this business. Recommend new management, do the manager a favor and get rid of him. I can only imagine how the food is prepared.

PS. The chicken nuggets taste like out-dated breaded shrimp.",0
I ordered a bacon smokehouse meal. The lady asked chicken or patty. No where on menu did it say chicken. The only thing I received correct with my order was the drink. I ordered beef and I received the chicken only. I ordered the meal and didn't receive my fries. Then the receipt said sandwich only with chicken. Usually when you order its automatically a meal unless specified otherwise. I ordered the meal she heard everything I said cause she repeated it back to me. I will make my stops elsewhere.,0
"I am only giving 1 star instead of 0 because the OTHER staff were great. I listened to the manager verbally abuse the staff & customers. The establishment was a disaster, including a gentleman with no shoes picking at his toes in the back booth. I feel sorry for anyone having to work under this manager. Even when he managed the courtesy to pull a employee to the back to ""speak"" to them, everyone was still able to hear the highly explosive conversation. l do however commend the other staff for holding it together although i did see one staff member crying while taking orders after a ""conversation"" with said manager. I pray UPPER MANAGEMENT reads this review and does something about this situation ASAP. This is the worst review i have ever had to write and hope to never have to write such a review again.",0
The self check out are down and apparently they dont serve lunch till 1100 on Saturday. This whole experience even with the pilot that shares its location was bad. I did call ahead but i got no answer from the pilot. Their showers and laundry is down they're doin construction but the truck parking lot is kinda tight. If a mom and poped open a truck stop around here id give them business. Also this mcdomalds doesnt have indoor dine in due to covid. If you want to be comfortable and sit in a restaurant and eat come to my home state of fl amd get real southern hospitality. We dont live in fear in fl. I didnt think texas had well i leave it at that. They could at least clean the sitting area even though it has caution tape and looms like a crime scene. A little broom and a mop would make a world of difference but the dust that has accumulated out yhere could give a person a cold. Companies really need to start rethinking this covid kick. With resent events people are going to become more conservative with their money. Oils is about to go up and energy pretty muck controls the market. Might be a good time for companies to become more hospitable,0

All Mondays were supposed to be free coffee for the month of December only for school employees. I didn't know that school employees go to truck stops to get coffee. I thought that were more of Star Bucks coffee drinkers. Very disappointed in Mc Donald's again.,0
"This location NEVER gets the order out the window correctly. I was shorted  half of my order AGAIN!!! DO NOT ORDER FOOD HERE!!!! I'm so sick of this, a refund doesn't mitigate the issue!! TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE ORDER AND MAKE DARN SURE THAT THE FOOD IS ALL THERE!! Y'all are providing a service, we pay you to get it right. Over and over I've had to make the delivery person do YOUR job. And guess what? Something is ALWAYS MISSING. usually an entire bag. Tonight, there are no fries. NONE. On a $40 order!!! Ridiculous. If I could give y'all no stars I would.",0
"It's a shame that I have to rate Mcdonalds a 1 star, but the service I received tonight was by far the worst I have experience and it needs to be addressed because now I will not be going back but the young lady that was working drive thru tonight her name is Elise was very rude and can not believe the way she talks to customers this is how exactly it went word for word and I work in customer service so I know how customers can be over the top when there complaining but word for word this is how it was, I honked my horn as I was in drive thru after I received my food because I had asked for ranch sauce and was given buffalo, keep in mind this is not a big deal for me and I will not be rude to the young lady over this but she took my honk as i did not have manners which is by far not my intentions I was simply trying to get her attention. She opened the window and asked me with a attitude Did you just honk? And started going off on me about manners, by then i was so upset that i just told her just hand me my ranch i will not argue with you as she still was holding the ranch still going off I then told her are you kidding me just give me the ranch and explained to her since I pulled up to this window you have had a rude attitude but that was not my place to get upset over that if she was having a bad night I just wanted my order so I can get back to work, as I addressed her attitude she then said to me Why cause I'm black? I was so beyond upset I have never been talk to this way from any restaurant and really do not know what this girls deal was and how did it lead to her assuming it was about her being black. Will not be going back.",0
I did an mobile online service and for the first and the drive thru person was so rude and didn't ask me for my order number but said my name. I pulled up to the window and waited for  my food and the drive thru person end up asking what my order was I am like are you serious and so I told him and was so mad cause I went to this location before and always had nice people but today and for now on I will not return to  this location because ever again. One bad experience makes you not want to come back. Even the manager sounded rude too.,0
"I stop here often only because it is on my way to and from work, but seriously this is by far consistently the worst McDonalds I have ever visited.  The milk shake machine is always broke down, as was tne case today.  I ordered a big mack, hold the catchup, fries and a diet coke. I even repeated myself to hold the catsup twice at the microphone and asked at the window again to insure she understood to hold the catsup on the burger and was meet with a very curt ""yes, I heard you"". Guess what , not only did they not hold the catsup but it was over loaded with extra catsup and I got a regular coke.  Well at least the fries were right.  I honestly believe the main problem is that the people taking orders at the drive thru speak poor English and obviously understand it equally as poorly, toped off with very poor customer service skills.  They s eriously act like the customers are a bother.",0

"After waiting five minutes in a drive through line the vehicle at the ordering microphone had to jump the curb to exit the line because the drive through lane was blocked by another car at the pickup window. When I pulled up to the order microphone I was greeted with ""pleas wait a second."" I replied, ""i've been reading the newspaper for the past five minutes and you are telling me to wait a second."" He said the computers were down and that they were accepting cash only. If they had any integrity for customer service they would have come out and told us that five minutes ago. I also had to jump the curb to leave the line. When I did, I was met with yelling from a person in the parking lot.",0
"They used to have average customer service and take forever in the drive thru. Now the customer service is also bad.

Oh gross dont ever eat hear now they are all dope heads here took 30 min to get my order that only consisted of 2 small fries and 2 cheese burgers,0
The whole time the worker was taking my order I felt rushed. she was rushing me. when I got home and checked my bag two barbecue sauces showed up on the screen when I was ordering but when I got home I was disappointed to see no sauces were in the bag.,0
"They are a crappie place, starting off with rude people, especially the guy in the drive through. I ordered a large orange juice with my breakfast meal then another meal with a large coffee. the drinks were wrong, then he says i have to charge you more for the upgrade. so 2 different transactions, 2 receipt then on the second receipt he didn't even want to give me",0
"It's fine that they're resetting their computers a bit later than they should, but to have their crew members unable to price out and take an order is unacceptable. Might as well close the store temporarily at that point.",0
The cashier ignored me 4/2 minutes and then finally whenever I asked if they were going to take my order she rolled her eyes and took my order and then I'm not sure if they just forgot to make my order or accidentally handed it out the window but after about 20 minutes I asked where my order was and none of the employees had any idea. I had to repeat what I had ordered about three different times and then about ten minutes later I got my food. I was on a lunch break at work a my entire brake was spent being ignored and waiting on food to be remade. I will never visit this status men again.,0
Came to this McD this morning. No my usual spot. Lol. Asked for water no ice got ice water.  Side of gravy. Gravy is spoiled. Asked for 4 splenda. Got 2.  Did not get hot cakes and there was a busted syrup in the bag with the splenda and gravy on its side. There was a manager at the window.  I always say please and thank you to everyone. I know it is busy but it only takes a second to listen to someone you are serving.  Chick-fil-a is always busy but you don't get this stuff there.,0
This restaurant really needs to get on board with keto or low carb burgers. I asked for a quarter pounder with cheese and bacon wrapped in lettuce.  They first brought it out without lettuce then they took it back after I asked it to be wrapped in lettuce a 2nd time I just threw a piece of lettuce on the top with no condiments,0

I continued to go there because she wasnt always there and now shes the only person who works the window at night i drive by to see if shes who is working and if she is i refuse to go at all because shes rude to me every time i go.

This is funny business .",0
I'm done. From the unprofessionalism of their restaurant workers to the fallacy of their app [can't input receipts when app glitches or give a complaint because their locator glitches].,0
Started at drive thru and started ordering food at first able to hear the lady but after I order my first thing I could not really hear her and then when I got my food it was wrong.,0

20mins to even order. Not cause they are busy cause it,0
Didn't get my order correct. No inside seating. I wish I could have tried their sausage gravy and biscuits but I am not taking that to go.,0
There a Lady at the Window everyday at Lunch time 12:00 and she is the RUDEST person ever like it a everyday thing she gets mad if you ask her for sauce they won put sauce unless you ask she rolls her eyes when I ask her. Pinche Vieja Amargada Con Nopal en La Frente. If you don,0
Sending everyone to overflow and then 20 minutes later delivered all reheated food that looks prepared over an hour ago. Whoever the order taker at 1pm is is the rudest woman ever. Terrible McDonald's,0
About this time...the girl that works at the register does not appreciate her job...she doesn't smile or say can I take your order...she says have you order yet? What type of customer services representative ask this question...and my food was incorrect. If you dont like your job find another one.,0
Always takes forever. They never smile and they퐎e never that friendly. I퐒e gone at night when it,0

"Ridiculously slow!!!! It is 12:40 a.m. and I have been here 15 minutes. Since I have been here I have watched the manager open the register I was standing at, then walk back to the office and then come back out to make herself a frappe and then walk back to the office. I come here Monday thru Friday as I am a truck driver and this McDonald's is inside the pilot. This sure isn't fast food!!!!!.",0
"The food was okay, but the service was horrible. I was even told to have a good night or anything like that. They need better customer service",0
SPENT 1/2 HOUR JUST TO GET 2 DRINKS AND A 20 PIECE NUGGET!! THATS NOT INCLUDING THE 15 MINUTES THE INCOMPETENT MANAGER ON DUTY AT NIGHT SPENT ON THE PHONE!!! THIS WAS AT 2:00 AM!! RIDICULOUS!!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS MCDONALD'S IF YOU WANT TO GET YOUR FOOD FAST.,0
Horrible McDonald and they charge yo,0
Everytime I come here these people make me wait at least 10 minutes for my and the food is mediocre at best! I never go unless everything else is closed.,0
"The drink they gave me had a pool of soda on top of the lid.  And most importantly they forgot to put the big mac I ordered in my bag.  I am a super trucker so I had to hit the road and didn't look in the bag until I was miles away.  Thanks, jerks!",0
This is the most disgusting McDonald I퐒e ever,0
I just left because if a store is thursday nasty then the food is not good. Cheese and lettuce all over the floor. About 3 employees walk past it at least 3 times. It takes 5 to 10 minutes to keep the floor clean,0
I am very irritated right now. The woman who took my order messed it up then shorted me on my order and I went back through to the rest of my order she proceeded to try and charge me again!! When I tried to call or talk to management I got fax noises. This is ridiculous will not be coming back this McDonald's!!,0
Wish I could give 0 stars. Waited in line to place an order and just stood there waiting without ever getting help. The manager was making a shake and giggling with the female workers. When he was done he never offered to take my order. I won't visit here again.,0
"This McDonalds is less than subpar. They've gotten most of my meals wrong, have charged me extra on items before and a few times have just given me the wrong order. I just stopped going here eventually and started going to another franchise down the 35.",0
Had to run to the bathroom all day after eating breakfast there. Yeah? Made for a long rotten work day. Don't eat here.,0
I walk in and waiting on the line for my turn to order. I ask the cashier I want strawberry milk shake. SHE SAYING THA MACHINES BROOK DOWN. McDonald's plz help.bad customer service.,0
"Their coffee machine is never ""ready yet"" when a certain manager works here in the morning. But it's always ready with every other manager. Hmm....",0
"Really bad manners kid with tattoo stars on his neck , asked for egg and cheese McGriddles 2 sausage biscuit and cheese and only tree sausage on them went back and ask them to correct it and just threw egg and cheese cold .. bad service, really should get reviewed by headquarters",0

Whoever manages overnight is literally the worst. They ignore the drive thru and when you go in they all run to the back and ignore you.,0
Store is supposed to be 24 hours. Employees say they're closed when they don't want to work,0
"Posted hours of operation indicate they're supposed to be open 24/7.  Went by at 1:30 AM on Saturday, and they're closed.  I guess I'll have to ignore the craving for a Quarter Pounder with cheese.",0
Very rude and unprofessional. They think just because someone they know comes in the store they퐎e allowed to let them cut in line,0
Been here multiple times yet they always seem to find a way to mess up my order . Would not recommend this location with the current staff .,0
They don't know how to make a dang mcchicken,0
The man behind the counter is out if control. He says inappropriate things. He said something about peeing on himself and getting arrested where all the customers who were eating  could hear.,0
"I have a medical condition which I can not wear a mask
I was refused service ,
I am a truck driver
I will never go into another McDonald's
And I will be telling everyone one how y'all do not care about any one with a medical condition",0
Horrible customer service the app didn work out did explain to employee but ,0
"Owner needs to go in as a customer in a disguise and see why people are complaining about the food and service.then weed out the screwups, starting at the top  and work your way down.it doesn't take a rocket scientist to flip a burger and make fries or speak English for God's sake.",0
"Worst McDonald's ever!!! My fries weren't even filled half way, and I paid to make my fries a large and still got a half empty medium.",0
I would never eat MacDonald.  I'll drink the coffee.  But thefood is garbage.,0
Third time in two weeks I wait through a long line only to find out that they are taking cash only.  Nobody can stand back at the entrance to the drive through to keep you from getting trapped in it.  This management team sucks.,0
Terrible servies but the food at that one is ok but those people were just talking and did not care that we were there,0
"They didn't have any forks, we waited ten minutes for our order, we didn't recieve any of the condiments we requested at the window",0
Fast and good,0
"Stopped by on my way to work, all I could see was the floor full of trash, trash cans over their limits, and the employees worried about who took holidays off or clocked in late instead of getting their selfs to clean",0
"Window employee was extremely RUDE! They took forever and had NO KETCHUP! Also, saw employee handling food without gloves!! EEWW!",0
I think they could  take out a lot more time cleaning and sanitizing there store. Gas station,0
There burgers has gotten worse than ever but their fries are still good.,0
It sucks they put the TVs on some BS Channel got 40 truckers sitting around wanting to watch the same thing and the manager is too stupid to know how to change the TV channel great service McDonald's business like this please go bankrupt or get out of the truck stop business,0
This was the worst experience I've ever had at a McDonald's night manager was very rude didn't want to attend customers at counter when I got to counter she said can't you read it says kiosk only I felt like she was in a bad mood and was taking it out on the customers and made me feel like she was being very racist,0
Spent 20 minutes inline at the drive through and the iced coffee was still very bland and unlike its normal taste,0

The water was off in this restaurant and they were still open for business. A clear health code violation.,0

This is one of the worst McDonald's in the area very very poor customer service,0
Place is great unless its morning apparently. They lost my damn order,0
No breakfast at night and cash only and they act like we're supposed to know this in advance.,0
they do not deliver the order as you paid,0

It took so long to get my food I thought I was waiting for them to finish slaughtering the cow to make my burger.,0
Staff was rude all food was cold horrible place to eat,0

I waited in line so long that I decided to buy my breakfast from Pilot.,0
Fries were cold and wasn't cooked all the way,0

"Placed a mobile order for pickup. Waited 15 minutes for a single burger that never got called. All of that wouldn't be so bad but when I called for a refund I was lied to by the manager that they called my order, which they did not. I stood inside for 15 minutes watching the counter to see if they had my order. So they lied and kept my money.",0
"PLEASE CHECK YOUR TO GO ORDERS BEFORE YOU LEAVE!! I would give negative stars, if I could. I ordered a to go order, but ended up staying to eat in the dining room.  I opened my quarter pounder hamburger and it was turned upside down with all of the toppings splattered onto the box as if it was slapped in there. It literally had no top hamburger bun, and when I brought this up to the cashier she said that this is what a ""quarter hamburger"" was. When I asked for just a top hamburger bun at least and showed the cashier the burger she didn't even apologize or offer to remake the burger she just snatched the box out of my hands. I paid for this burger and was only asking for the bun, not making a scene or demanding anything or being rude. I had chosen to not acknowledge the mess it was because there are enough verbally abusive patrons. But all the cashier ended up doing was turn the burger right side up (no gloves) and slap an undercooked bun on it, and yell at the other adult woman at the grill about ""what's missing here?"". It wasn't even busy in the drive thru or the dining room. I can't pretend to know their job or lives, but I hope they aren't this effed up to every PAYING customer. I ended up asking for a refund, and not taking the burger, even this was an issue. Please beware!! I only regret not getting their names to report them. Again, not trying to be  a drama queen but I worked hard to afford this little splurge to get this slap in the face.",0
I ordered an egg muffin at 5:30 AM.  I was expecting a fresh one.  The bread was overly chewy so for some reason I opened it up and looked inside.   There were dark clumps of matter in which I can only presume was dead chicken fetus.,0
"Waited 20 minutes for someone to take my order, no one ever did. They kept changing the cash drawer and taking orders from drive thru but the left a line of people inside waiting. Myself and a few other customers left after being treated like we didn't matter. Never again! Do not waste your time at this location!",0
Went with wife and daughter. Ordered 2 McDonald's and a kids meal. Took 35 mins to get food. Everyone was waiting that long and room wasn't even busy. Workers were just standing around in back bullshytting. Lady called out my number and was very rude as she just dropped bag on table..... will not be back... if you hate your job QUIT!!!,0
"The drive through staff is very unprofessional, they leave you sitting at the speaker box waiting to place an order, they have a very rude attitude when taking your order and they act like it is an inconvenience for you to be there. This is already a very overpriced McDonald's because of the strip location. Find a better place to visit for something to eat it's not worth the hassle here.",0
"I wanted to eat McDonald's @near Mandalay Bay.. The Asian lady was so rude, I was ready to give my order to her, she says oh you're not ready and walked away, she refused to take my order not once but 2 times.

"This Mc Donald's was either short staff or very  unorganized. It took a while to get our order, staff looked like they were overwhelmed and people kept going back to fix their order's.",0
"The automated kiosks are horrible.
This store is supposed to be fully automated.. but that's probably the reason why it just doesn't work.   McDonalds should really look into the process and solve it. The workers are at the mercy of inferior technology.

I go into McDonalds and am instructed to use the kiosks.

There are some that aren't working.. some that are working.  A customer instructs me not to use the one I'm facing because it's broken.  Instead.. I use the one on the other side.

The process of ordering on the kiosk is slow and cumbersome.  I have a coupon which I wanted to use.  I first add the item.. then scan the coupon.. VOILA... double order.  Okay.. my bad for not understanding the system.  So now I have to remove the item... I add another item.. and it takes me to the cart for some reason and says ""Is this all I want?""

So I add some more things and finalize my order.  I try to check out, but I have no way to edit my order to select to go.  Okay.. no big deal.. I'll just choose a table... and VOILA.. ERROR.. Please see a cashier.

I talk to the McDonalds attendant and he tells me that he could find my order and that I can pay up front.

During this time.. I see and here about 3-4 people sadly yelling at the McDonalds workers for messing up (really.. it's this automated system that doesn't work... not the people.)

McNuggets were okay.  They were warm.. but were on the verge of being dry.
Fries were okay... looked like they were out for awhile.. (and they didn't fill it to the top).
Soda... this was good.

I felt bad for the workers here since it seems the biggest issue is problems with the kiosks and how orders are sent over to workers.",0
"This Macdonalds fell short on a good quality customer service, their staff was very rude to us and a few other customers on our day of visit, they messed up on our order and we ended up eating 30 mins apart to my wife, I was so disappointed. Place was clean and you had to ask for a key to go into the restrooms, we were in Vegas for vacations and we stayed at mndalay so this was the closest one to us, the 3rd day we wanted Macdonalds again and we decided to drive 15 mins ",0
One of the thing i regret doing is not looking at reviews. Went through the drive thru at 1 am. No one was in line. Food was horrible. Some fries were soaked in grease and were cold stale. Nuggets were way too under cooked it was cold. Find another McD's and only use this if its an absolutely LAST resort to eating!,0

I totally understand you guys are under staff

i get it,

but no even apologized for given  the wrong order
Caroline o wherever name was the supervisor on duty was rude and upset because she said they made the order and understood mkstakes happens it

You guys need to ask for the tickets that helps alot to prevent this kind of mistakes
Also please put a sign if you guys are not droping the food to the table so we know we have to wait for the food at the counter

My simple order had multiple mistakes and there seem to be an almost comical line of people who were missing hash browns from their orders. The entire dining room was disgusting.  Not that it's their fault, but there was a homeless man in front of the store that looked to be on the verge of vomiting and or dying.   This was like 8:00 a.m. on a tuesday, so I assumed they were short staffed if it was that dirty at that hour. One of my two sandwiches and both of my hash browns, once I visually got them, were good.",0

Ironically, as much as the wait was bad, it was the attitude of some of the team members that made this experience extremely terrible. McDonald's corporate really needs to come here and train thestaff for hospitality. This location is a disgrace to what Donald's has boult over the years",0

Once we got the drinks the iced hazelnut latte with less ice was more than an inch empty from the top in a medium and it was so sweet it made me feel nauseous. And when asking to fix it they said that's how it comes and didn't even apologize even though I've had this many times and it's never tasted like this EVER. We also got a Carmel frappe with Oreo topping and an espresso shot; once we got it it didn't have any Oreo or espresso.,0
Waited 20 minutes in the drive thru and never made it to put my order in so I got the cars behind me to let me out of line!,0
12 minutes to get 3 cars out of the drive thru line. When all the cars needed to be told was please pull around to expedite speed of service. I left without eating because of time.,0
The kiosks are always breaking down and the cashiers don't like to place orders on the register. Besides the very poor customer service there are unfortunately alot of homeless people and junkies here that sometimes get violent and steal. I had my laptop stolen from this place. I reported it to the manager on duty since I sat in front of a camera but was not helped at all. Stay away from this place,0
"Eating McDonald's burgers in the United States is the worst time, because the chicken inside has been fried repeatedly, and it has reached the point where it can hardly be chewed",0

"The food was horrible. Didn't bring our food to us like the kiosk said they do. We had to go get it. Meat on the big Mac were super thin and chunks of meat missing. We brought to they're attention and they made a new ono which had cracks through the meat and way too much lettuce. Dry too.
Never again will I go there and not recommend going there.",0

Ok ,0
Worst McDonald's ever. None at the front counter so we were forced to use the one working kiosk. Had to show the person in front of us how to use it. We ordered two happy meals. No receipt was provided. We were asked to sit outside to wait for our food. When our order was complete it was left on the pickup counter without notification. Order was missing fries and the person we finally tracked down said we needed a receipt. Absolutely rediculous.,0

The floor doesn't look like it's been cleaned in weeks. My shoes stuck to the floor so strongly that one pulled off. To top it all off, the staff were rude to several customers who were confused by the disabled ordering systems.",0

I've been travelling around the world

Very slow and poorly run store. Has potential to be a great location with great profits. But the management is horrid and help is not helpful and pretty much hasn't clue on what is going on. Ordering takes for ever and food even longer.,0
GROSS. DIRTY AS HELL. Every hand sanitizer pump was empty there was trash all over the dining area and I waited 20 min for a 4pc nuggets and Mcchicken. Food tasted like it was cooked in burnt oil i threw it out... Waste of time and money.,0

They asked us to pull around the building but usually if there's no one behind us we say ""we'd like to wait here please"" We know it's all about their timer and restarting it so they say ""look at how fast we got them out""  usually when there's no other car behind us other fast food places say ok but one of the girls at the window kept yelling at us to move. Go to a different one.",0
"Not only am I not a big fan of fast food joints but I'm absolutely opposed to filth in any restaurant.
And filth is what I experienced at this McDonald's.
The staff who waited on us was nice, accommodating, and quick, and the food adequate; but the restaurant itself had empty sugar and creamer packs laying everywhere. Reason being, there as no place to throw them away.
So, I am advising you to avoid this McDonald's!",0
"They forgot my apple slices, but still charged me. we literally only ordered 8 hashbrowns 3 soft drinks and my apples... it was not a hard order at all. And I didn't notice till we got back to our hotel, because you know you can't eat indoors or even outside.",0

"I got a value meal hamburgers were very dry,no condiments on the bun. fries were not cooked all the way still frozen. The Coca-Cola was flat. I don't expect gourmet just a little bit better quality.",0

She could have easily made it right but failed to do so. I will no longer visit this McDonalds and I urge others to avoid it like the plague. There are plenty of other fast food restaurants in the area that are worth visiting.",0
We wait 30 min and they still forgot our drinks and the still didn give us all the drinks we decided to leave without our iced coffee and large coke because they were taking for ever also when we tell him we were missing some drinks he throw the straws inside our car worst ,0
"After ordering my food and waiting for over 10 minutes to get it. Coffee was luke warm, I went back to get fresh cup and I was handed a cup that had been sitting on the counter. I told the young lady that it wasn't hot either and she said that it was the normal temperature of their coffee. I finally got her to pour me a fresh hot cup. This is definitely not the place to go to for 'fast food'.",0
"Cashier I believe name is Mike.  Was made because i order fresh french fries.  So 1st he gave me old cold fries.  When i expressed that i asked for fresh fries and after the supervisor said upgrade me to a large, he brought a small skimpy bag so i asked for the supervisor.  Instead he pour a Ton of salt on the next fries he brought out.  Sad.",0
Worse service ever. Waited for 15 minutes in line got to the menu to order at 1025. The lady taking our said she will be right with us came back to take our order at 1029. We tried to order breakfast and she told us they are not serving breakfast. Granted the menu outside still showed breakfast. She tells us they are only serving lunch. We told her we had been there before 1030. She says sorry I can sell breakfast to you and then says we can talk to the manager. Pulled up to talk to the manager she was rude and said they ran out of breakfast. At 1028 we said ok we were at the menu at 1025. She then said I don know what to tell you we ran out of breakfast. Shut the window on us. We were going to order lunch but she didn,0
"Slow, rude, disgusting sticky tables inside the lobby. You'd think you were ordering in a third world country not the Las Vegas strip. Ronald would be disappointed!!",0
The dinner room is closed.  The drive thru is open but if you order inside at the counter you must take your food outside and you can eat on the curb surrounded by the homeless.  Even the outdoor seating area is closed off.  What a sad state of affairs.,0
"Very slow to take your orders and when you get it, it taste like it was yesterday",0
"no free refill at this Mc Donald, you have to ask the stuff (!!!) - just one refill is possible, restrooms are closed",0
"This was one of the worst McDonald's that I've ever been to. I went to the one on Warm Springs and Las Vegas Blvd, the customer service was excellent, they greeted us and made us feel like they cared. We Sked for no onions, we got just that. Our fries were fresh and hot. We wanted more and our tea was watery as we has already started down the Blvd, we went to the next McDonald's that we saw. We ordered fries and a double cheeseburger with no onions. We pulled up to the pay window and asked if we could trade the sweet tea and showed our receipt, the lady told us to ask at the next window, we pay and pull forward. The next person says no we dont do that, I asked for a supv, she explained to me that the other was a franchise and they are corporate. I accepted that. My fries were stale and my burger has onions. I sent them back, they then tasted like they redropped the same fries in the chicken nugget oil. I will never go there again.",0
"Worst mc Donald's I was ever in employee constantly shouting out numbers to collect food, rude too, only mc Donald's I've been in where that is done",0
Exactly what you'd expect from a McDonald's minus the speed which is disappointing for fast food. We went during what seemed to be rush hour but there was only a skeleton crew on and a single server. We waited for 40 minutes for our food and some of it came cold.. i dont even know how that happens. Definitely not impressed by the service,0
"It smelled like a dead body in there. Filthy floors, meth heads laying on the sidewalk outside. The food was vile and disgusting, I threw it out the window within a block and it was still there the next morning. It's pretty bad when racoons and homeless meth heads won't even eat it.",0
"Don't bother using mobile app. You will wait in line.  Doors locked and no signs telling you lobby closed.  Manager making excuses claiming there is notice, 20+ people count find one.  Needs to be fired for lying .   We visited 4/1 @ 9:55am and parking lot was full of people trying to get into store tugging on doors wondering what is going on.",0
"Poor customer service and  management. Our orders were incomplete, we asked staff to help us with the missing orders but it took 3 staff to confirm including the lady manager ( i think her name us caroline) before we get our orders completed. We have not received any apologies from staff and manager told us that we퐎e disturbing her break. Very defensive and sassy manager. Ma",0
This place completely ignores the folks that come inside. They will focus on the Drive thru and that's it. Don't expect much from Macdonalds to start with but this REALLY lowered the bar,0
"The lady in front of me had a coupon for an ice coffee or something and the order taker thought it was for a regular coffee. So the manager comes over and tells the lady she needs to pay an extra dollar to get the ice coffee  The lady customer then shows her the coupon which must have made the manager mad because she sternly tells the order taker to give her her ice coffee .

Then she rudely tells everyone in line to go use the kiosk  that they'll no longer take orders the normal way.
I'd already stood in line almost 10 minutes and was next but that didn't matter.

Ever since they changed this McDonald's around a couple of months ago and got new management the service, to me, has been terrible, which really sucks because for over 2 years now this is where I mostly take my breaks.
After tonight I will no longer buy food from the McDonald's on the Strip at four seasons.",0
One of the worst MC D I have even been. The place was not clean and the server messed up our order.,0
"One of the worst run McDonalds. Chaos inside. The order kiosks were only partially working, long wait times and at least 4 people had problems with their orders. Needs a lot of attention.",0
Very poor toilet was locked dirty,0
"I'm giving 2 starts because we went there last week and was hard to order our food, using the machine they have, some are not working, the security guy didn't help, few workers only, took us a while to wait for our food, also you can't eat inside only outside and the tables they have outside doesn't have enough shade, with those high temperatures and eat outside is not recommended, I will recommend them if they are not allowing to eat inside a least shade the table outside.",0
"I was very disappointed with my visit there, everything was a shambles from the moment we went in orders not processed properly didn't think anyone was taking charge on a good note when the food come it was good.",0
Worst experience at a McDonald I퐒e ever had took 40 mins to get our food only cause I complained if I di,0
Slowest McDonald's on the strip waited 17 minutes for 2 mcdoubles and a small fry and gave me a attitude,0
"Been hear for 10min and no one has come out to help me!
Then they took the order of the person who was in front of us then walked away",0
The worst McDonald's in Am,0
worst experience ever :( it's fast food I only ordered 5 ice creams and we've waited more than 30 minutes. horrible,0
It was dirty and spills on the floor were still there after I ate. The tables were dirty and the workers there were rude to other customers. THEY WERE VERY RUDE!!!,0
Waited 30 min in the drive through and did not even move. Rude cashier and no salt even on fries. Lol and they want to make $15 an hour! Comical,0
"drive thru slow af! Had to repeat myself 3x thru mic, at the window, waited another 5 min! Not even busy neither!",0
"Where do I freaking start? Maybe at the $33.57 for a Big Mac, Double Quarter Pounder and a Large Fry. Oops yes they forgot the cheese and if that's not enough it was cold. Keep your money and starve.",0
"Ordered from the kiosk. No receipt printed. Asked for a receipt and the staff is so incompetent that no one could generate one, and refused to simply hand write one stating that they did not know what I had ordered (it was in the bag I was holding!)",0
"Deceptive pricing! FTC Violation.  Menu says add drink to the bundle for $1.00, but they charged $1.69 manager would not honor menu price in violation of Federal law. Bathrooms out of order. They were making people order on the kiosk only, and calling out the table numbers instead of delivering the food to tables.",0
"Employees are rude, nothing was made after I placed my order online 30 minutes before. went through the drive thru and they didn't even know how to process the order through the app.",0
"Since it's on the strip, prices are more expensive for example the $1 drink is like 1.89, they are multiple McDonalds within 2 miles that have regular pricing. Some of the staff seems to not have all of it down pact, had to wait several minutes for them to correctly enter no onions no pickles on the sandwhich.",0
I've been in places in 3rd world countries cleaner than this. But I will say the food taste normal. If your at Mandalay bay and nothing else is open it's an option but I wont go hear again. Hopefully I dont get hepatitis.,0
"Came at 2am and the chicken nuggets tasted stale. Had likely been sitting there for awhile. I wouldn't have minded waiting longer for a fresh batch, but perhaps they were expecting a rush and wanted to get rid of old food.",0
"One car in front of me , they order big mac meal, 17 mins to get it. Worst customer service ever",0
Service sucked old people shouldn't be directed to a computer to place there order evey thing doesn't have to be automated does it older Americans made Micky D's what is today so show some respect my money is green and so is my debit card bye have a nice day ps what ever happened to service with a smile,0
"The widow attendant didn't greet us or make eye contact, simply gave me the amount due. She gave us our order and didn't say bye or thank you. The worst part of all was that it was the manager or one of the managers. Thursday night,  approximately 10pm.",0
"Prices are too high just because they're on the Strip you don't have to double your prices personally I think it's ridiculous why rip everyone off , just cuz you're on the Strip , yeah I know rent is more expensive , But you get so much more traffic so many more customers. It goes hand-in-hand",0
The asian lady tried her best but ahe has very poor staff that provide horrible service. The big tall black lady cut me off while I was ordering at the window and made me come inside and the white girl with purple hair rolled her eyes at every customer who came in contact with her. The place was filthy. My chicken sandwich has a hole in it! Not a good place to eat. Do not eat here!,0
"Your trash employees have the store closed at 4pm in the afternoon.

Fire the afternoon crew for today",0
The big 0 rating . People are very rude and my uber eats order was not even placed. Waiting 15 minutes already and still waiting. I truly wish I could post pics here because the store is FILTHY AND YES I TOOK PICS FOR DIRTY DINING. EVERY TIME I COME IN HERE IT'S GROSS .,0
There was not a long wait in the drive thru but the food was cold and stale.   Fries un salted and cold fish sandwich was dry and sad.   Will not be going back,0
Very long wait for food.. coffee not made the usual way. Cashier did his best to be courteous but without correct leadership that is best we will get!,0
It's been a long time since I have received the attitude I did when I asked for the coke I had ordered but did not receive. Hopefully this is not a regular example of behavior for this location.,0
Manager Vanessa was the rudest person I have ever met. She was cursing at customers. This place needs new management.  Very disrespectful.,0
Pricing is wrong and people will bud you and they serve them without issue. Brutal location.,0
It was late at night so I was happy to see they we still open. But the food was made terrible very sloppy and had a bad smell to it. So I was unsatisfied.,0
"It's simple. Website says open 24 hours, yet they're closed at 4am on a Saturday night with workers inside. Unacceptable.",0
"""Open 24 hours"" we got here at 2.30 am and they say it's not open until 3.30 am. Finally they open at 3.40 am but they wouldn't accept cards, only cash. Then the girl at the cashier, Heidi she said, was attending the register and then going to the kitchen, no gloves, touching the food, so rude and so loud, terrible service here today.",0
Sad that they only had three employees. God bless them and shame the way McDonald's treats employees. This is a Corporate owned not a franchise. Bad ,0
Could be because the place was under construction but the service was ridiculously slow: we spent at least 5 minutes at the second window. The lady tried to keep two of our drinks and there was no napkins in the bag.,0
"Bathrooms are locked in a way that only a manager can open them.  Then, there's no hand soap or toilet paper.  Took FOREVER to get us our food.  Just sub-satandard...even by McDonalds standards!",0
Service sucks ?unable to provide my order before 45 minutes of waiting. Then received the,0
This place sucks. Customer service is awful. We stood in line at the drive-thru for 20 minutes and they never took our order.,0
"Every McDonalds on the planet has the two sausage mcmuffin with egg for $3.33 special except for these guys. The lady taking the order says ""we don't have specials - there's too many tourists."" After getting a manager to translate ""can I have a receipt please"" to the cashier that spoke zero english, I took my overpriced food and split. The one positive is the three bums fighting in the parking lot did provide for some entertainment while I waited.",0
"Best to look for other stores, coz this one won't deliver your order ever",0
They no respect the prices for example the breakfast promotion 2 sauce McMuffin for $4.50 they want pay $8.45,0
"Not open 24hrs, 2am closed already",0
"$3.88 for two large cokes?  You can go eff yourselves.  The McDonalds down the street charges $1.08 each.  Or, I can stop at Circle K on my way home from the Strip and get a Polar Pop 44oz for .79 cents plus tax.",0
Can't get a refill because of Covid?  All you have to do is use a new cup.  I think at a $1.79 per drink one cup won't cut into the profit margin that much.  But I wouldn't want to send McDonald's into bankruptcy.  Quit being cheap and hiding behind Covid for an excuse.,0
I work the midnight hours down the street. Stopped by at 0130 and the place was closed. Not a 24 hour operation.,0
"Mcds is expensive for the type of food and how they treat the employees. I ordered sausage McMuffin, hash brown, LG c9ffee 7.00$$$ my total is 1.19, 1.45, 1.60 plus 8.25 tax under 5.00. I'm sorry but mcds make billions per day and steals even more. Going 2 manager .Seriously people needs 2 be more aware what companies are doing. You say it's only 2.00 but it happens all the time. And the companies is the only one who benefits. Just saying. Sad!!!!",0
If McDonald's were a raccoon who served you garbage you'd be in a better spot. Good luck humanity.,0
"Meh...just meh. Back in the day McDonalds was a treat you looked forward to, now the foods more expensive, the fries are never fresh, and the buns are usually stale. They've dropped the ball.",0
"Totally rude customer service. When we asked to fix the problems they snarled with their pissy attitudes.
The women's name was Bryanna who denied me a simplebsqueeze of whipped cream.
WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER !!",0
This place wasn't the best. The worst food I had the entire trip the soda wasn't mixed well either. I do hope they were having an off day and things get better for them.,0
our food was cold and we didn,0
This McD's location has NO sit down dinning available. I requested extra pickles and still got only 1 pickle per cheese burger. Lame.,0
Worst McDonalds ever we waited over 30 minutes for our order just for them to mess up our order and we waited another 30 minutes for our food,0
They sold me a returned food and coffee last night. The cashier asked me if I can wait by the back door and didn't want to give me my receipt and brought me burgers with no napkins and they put cream in my coffee which was not in my order.,0
"Closed totally not 24hr

050421-Drive Thru Only. If you order thru the app there is no take out, curbside or, dine in.",0
No fillet o fish chicken nuggets were cold taste like cardboard hardly any ice in my tea no value menu whatsoever,0
"More expensive than other McDonalds in Las Vegas and smaller drinks (ice coffee) ""Medium"" is ""Small"" here",0
"Really slow service.  Waiting at counter just to be helped.  Need to get a special for the locals that live in the neighborhood , because prices are high because on strip. We're not visitors some of us live right here",0
Needs cleaned inside and out,0
WARNING WARNING WARNING.........Do not eat here I found a screw in my sandwich an the night manager hung up on me after telling me to walk back up there with my burger to show her. Very rude service bad maintenance apparently. And I'll be calling corporate in the morning,0
"Manager is so slow.
Waited 35 minutes for our food. They were putting out the smaller orders instead of the bigger orders.",0
Expensive does not share the promotions of other McDonald's nor does it offer the full menu of other McDonald's. In short pay more get less as they told me that's the strip for you,0
"Can't any drive through ever get my order right? This rude girl, I am not going to mention her name, she would be fired for racial obscenities just to start. But no apology from her or anyone else there. Ruined my appetite. ",0
Dining room was not open for takeout. Not very friendly to this is us that drive large vehicles that won't fit through the drive thru,0
This location is horrible bad service no matter what time of day. it takes forever to get your food and every time I go there for breakfast which used to be a lot my mcmuffins were always burnt,0
"Not a fan of fast food, and still not....just needed something quick",0
"two mc chicken 1 hr wait, manager is very rude.",0
Kinda hard to stay open when you don't have a cashier.,0
"3 years ago,a was a pleasure to order. Now is terrible, you order something in specific and you get different order. I called corporate and IM STILL WAITING for them to call me back.",0
Service was so slow and then given wrong order,0
Staff is rude. Orders are always wrong.lines are long. Very unprofessional management,0
"This place out horrible and terrible service, they pick who can eat inside, then tell everyone else have to take it to go, also I order here had to eat outside but yet they won",0
"Dr.Pepper was flat. French fries were over salty when asked for NO Salt. Employee in drive thru wasn't very friendly either,sort of felt like she didn't like her job.",0
Nothing personal I just don't like the quality of the food. This was the only place open on Christmas so.....,0
First you need to buy food before ask for the restroom ,0
We had to literally argue with the shift Supervisor to get more creamer and sugar for my coffee. Ill never go there again!,0
"This has got to be one of the worst McDonald's around...Lines are slow, employees don't smile and can be rude, food is undercooked and store is dirty.  Always this way, and management could not seem to care less.  Avoid this one if you can.",0
how do you like it when a person taking your order sneezes on you why would they be there sick why would they be contagious why would they be spreading their disease the stinking billionaires turn on McDonald's Auto send them home when they're sick and give them pay these franchises make billions of dollars by just using McDonald's name it's not really McDonald's it's a private persons company and they do whatever they want they charge whatever price they want it's not even McDonald's,0
Stay away from this place. I don't expect stellar service from McDonald's but the service here is absolutely terrible. The people who work here have the attitude of not wanting to be here.,0
Very slow service. I worked for McDonald before and we were trained to acknowledge the ptron by letting them know you're there and be with them shortly.,0
Takes forever to get served and you're guaranteed to get your order and correct. Waited over 30 minutes for my order,0
Terrible. Shells in egg mcmuffins (BOTH McMuffins) And large soda was only 24 oz and had a nasty taste,0
Just left McDonald after a wait of 20 minutes and left with nothing. We made order milk shake and icecream and when we reached the window. She said the machine is down and I forgot to tel you because I was busy.,0
"Had to wait for food in the back of  restaurant for ten minutes for food , then they forgot to me my fries!!",0
"No drive thru, have to oder using a board, not a person. Ugh!",0
"It's McDonald's, the food is ok, the service is ok, the dining area could use more seats. But too many transients hanging around.",0
"Very bad service
I got my breakfast, then back to get my lunch
I couldn find my car
The security of the plaza towed my car
I spoke with the Mac manager she said we don know, she does care
U ca",0
The customer service is good but can't say the same for the food also got some defective lids,0
I will never here again I asked. For hot fries an a pie an even waited for the pie to be so call. Being cooked it never was brought out so that it for me for life,0
Went for breakfast today 3/26.. No coffee was ready. Waited awhile for my food and there was only one other customer.. oh and I counted about eight people behind the counter.... RIDICULOUS !,0
Total rip off. None of the McD discounted items like $1 coffee or coupons are honored here.,0
It's McDonald's so expect slow service complete with incorrect orders. I personally don't go to this McDonald's because of it.,0
The food was ok but way over priced for a McDonald's and the fries had no flavor.  I dont suggest it.,0
"Ice cream machine was down for 2 days, not going to go back, just goto another McDonald's.",0
My hot n spicy was thrown in the bag outside of the paper. And it wasnt even hot it was like room temp.,0
"Very unprofessional staff, rude manager dirty floors, and a very long waiting time",0
It Was OK,0
I order 3 20 pieces receive 30 unacceptable  that's not how you do business don't like it,0
"I was on my break from work, I order on the app trying to get my food as soon as posible and first they take almost one hour to give me my food and it was 3 more persons waiting for there food and when I check my food it was a dirty napkin inside my food and they refused to make it again they just refund my money to my bank and they say I'll take up to one week to have my money on my account after they mistake",0
"The food was good as usual, but the restrooms were very very dirty, so disappointing, dirty tables, we had to clean with antibacterial wipes",0
You have to order by kiosk. It took over 10 minutes to get a cup of coffee with only 2 orders in front of me.,0
Asked for new fries and got the same back brown and dry. Iced coffee always not good at this location i wont be back ever,0
Apparently this location thinks it is above the law by Serving hot food and not providing a restroom for the Customers that buy here.,0
Sketchy area. Drunk hobos passed out on the outside tables in the middle of the day.,0
Not gonna lie i only gave it 2 stars because we couldnt eat inside other than that service n food were on point good Mcdonalds,0
Terrible. Waited for 32 minutes and compared to others that was short. Food was cold and staff seemed nonchalant about everything.,0
Worst Mcdonald's ever!!!! The homeless will attack you and the security will just stand there . stay in the casino if u want Mcdonald's not worth it!!!!,0
Had a cheeseburger and soggy fries which was awful (I had been tempted by the clever marketing of the signature collection). It was extremely disappointing.,0
Too dependant on technology... Cashier's expect you to use kiosk. No team members at registers.,0
"Waited 30 minutes to get food, spending about 70.00, and not a friendly manager.",0
worst ever customer service. manager is so rude dont even apologize for the wrong order.,0
Pretty positive the spicy  chicken nuggets had mold ,0
The manger was just the worst had no sympathy for my kids who were hungry I walked to drive thru asked to serve me she said no cause I don't have a car I said please my kids are hungry nope i rented a taxi to just get food ...,0
This location had horrible service. Possibly because it was later in the evening.,0
Wasted my time and gas coming to a place that claims to be 24hrs but they are closed,0
Not 24 hours right now it's 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. I'm not sure what the weekend hours are unless they changed it again,0
One of the girls was rude was standing there by cash register for 3 minutes before she said go to the kiosk machine I asked why I couldn't order there she said it's not my drawer in a rude way,0
"No salads, no chicken fingers, no shakes, no thank you.  Why is McDonald's even still around anymore?",0
Awful experience at this location!! Waited over 45 minutes for food and had to request refund.,0
This place sucks! Couldn't get the order right. Service was very slow.,0
"Very Poor service,they serve our food very incomplete ( no butter,no pancake syrup,no hashbrown,no caramel frappe,no fork,also they lost our receipt",0
The black people that work here are absolutely extremely rude and very disrespectful to their customers stay away,0
Worse McDonald's on the strip dirty an employee's have a attitude,0

McD on the Strip Near Welcome Sign has two below-average features: a cattle barn-like atmosphere and employees who go down to the basement to smile. But the prices are world class.,0
"In the USA, the bottom of fast food is just as low as here... Or a little better there. A Denny's or a Wendy's sells homemade burgers for this. Kar that there is not a single fast food chain in Hungary.",0
"I do not understand how the male supervisor with green locs who is working right now, still has a job. This is the second time I came to me and my children were mistreated at this location. Even writing this trying to remain professional is extremely hard. I went through the drive through on each occasion. He was rolling his eyes, condescending, disrespectful, disregarded my concern, slammed and locked the windows while I was talking?I walk inside to get an upper management personnel and her name was Roseline. When I asked her if she was above the side in the picture, she threw her arm out and said what happened. She walked away and disregarded my concern. There was a African guy with a coat on in the food are passed me the sauce and told me it was not his job to do so.. this loca",0
"Food was fine. But, when we came a large family were at the cash taking kiosks so we used a regular kiosk and waited to pay cash at the register. When the manager came to take cash they gave a look like we were crazy then said you ""you know we have a cash kiosk?"", to which I responded that people are at it. It wasn't overly rude, but execution was totally annoyed at us the customer. Hope it's not like that next time we visit.",0
"A disappointing visit. We ordered using the kiosk since no one was manning the counter cash register. We waited over 20 minutes for 3 standard combo meals and no one else was inside the restaurant. The people working in the back only worked on drive thru orders. While waiting, we watched as they cleared our order off the monitor without having served it. At that point, I asked one of the employees why our order was cleared and he responded that he didn't realize it hadn't been served. We were the only people in the restaurant and we were clearly waiting at the counter for something, whether it was food or a condament or napkins and they never even bothered to ask what we needed or what we were waiting for. The staff completely ignored us until we asked why our order was cleared without getting anything. They did make our order fresh once we asked for it, which is why I gave more that 1 star for the food. We would not return to this location.",0
"Drive through experience. Long line, no problem, tourist area. Took a while to take my order. When I paid, the person didn't even make eye contact, he gave me my receipt without saying a word except for the total and shut the window. Then, went to the 2nd window where the guy gave me the water bottle and sent me to the 3rd window. By the time I paid, at 10:02 pm, it was 10:20 pm and I was still waiting on anyone to come to the 3rd window. Then a female employee brought me a kid's meals and when I asked her for the rest of the order, she waved her hand and said ""I don't know"" with an attitude. She left and I waited 5 more mins before anyone came to the window. A male manager came and I explained what was missing plus to look at the happy meal that only had 4 fries, cold nuggets, no toy, no sauce, no napkins. When I showed the kid's meal, he said what happened to the fries? (as if we ate them). I looked at him and said ""that's what you guys gave me and to look at the camera"". He then said ""hold on"" and slammed the window. Another 5 mins go by, gave me the food and I asked where is the sauce and he said the 1st bag, but it wasn't there. As he was getting me the sauce, I told him this was the worst service ever and that I was going to put a review. He shrugged his shoulders, slammed the window and left. I then proceeded to hunk my horn very loudly to see if he came back to the window, but he never did.
I'm a store manager myself and I would never tolerate a behavior like that from any of my managers or from any of my team members. My 6 year old grand-daughter was in the car and was crying with this upsetting situation.
I visit this location at least 3-4 times a week, never had problems like this with the other shifts.",0
Not only was it packed and slow moving but our mobile app that said ready in 3-5 minutes actually tool close to 15 minutes. A BIG thing was having to pay to have a refill on your drink. That is ridiculous.,0
"I came to this mcdonalds to pick up an order for a customer as I deliver with Uber Eats and the manager refused to make the order because he said ""we are too busy and dont have the time to prepare such a big order, plus these are lunch and dinner items we will be switching over to breakfast in 20 minutes."" So my customer was cheated out of their order and I was screwed out of $35!!!! I reported the restaurant to Uber support as well as Mcdonalds corporate offices. Avoid this mcdonalds if you can. Terrible!!",0
"The food is always cold there's always a long wait time and some of the managers just don't care. One of them was mad I complained about my fries not being cooked all the way so he snatched them out of my child's hand and those were not even the ones I was complaining about, he then asked me if I had a recipe. When he was the one that took my money and didn't give me one.",0
"Absolutely disgusting, please tare this place down and build a Wendy with new  employees. I wasted my money. I urge you not to waste your money and",0
"First i'm looking at my receipt. I ordered two cheeseburger happy meals and only got a hamburger with one pickle on it. Then the manager tries to tell me that the drinks are dispensed on how you water them. I threw my receipt at him. I ordered a sweet tea and dr pepper
I was given a hi-c .

Untop of it I wish I can post a photo of my two orders of fries thrown on the groud because they were uncooked.",0
"Raw burger. Spoke with manager Nattie, she defended the raw burger saying it passed a temperature check. She reluctantly agreed to make a new one a took my receipt.  20 minutes later still no burger. Went to the counter, a girl there gave the burger to someone else. Another burger was made, but they ""lost"" the receipt.  While standing at the counter waiting for a receipt to be reprinted, I was holding onto my bag. A man behind the counter tried to grab the bag out of my hand. I told him ""hands off"", he said he was checking the order number. TOTAL INCOMPETENCE! I went to complete the survey on the receipt BUT IT HAD ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED!!!",0

This is the most Discusting McDonald I,0

"Sign indicates free item if the person taking your order doesn't ask about rewards. The Male taking our order didn't ask. We told them at the window. The manager told us the girl that took our order did ask us we explained that it wasn't a girl it was the man. To which she rolled her eyes,walked away and didn't return. We also didn't recieve our bottle water, napkins  nor straws for the drinks we did get.",0
"Lucky they even get the rating they do. Placed a mobile app order at 9:49am and was still waiting for 3 sandwiches 45 minutes later. Not a single person acknowledged me standing at the front counter, but had no problem passing orders out to those using the kiosk. Go thru the drive thru to be given the excuse that their ""short handed"", yet I spent 45 minutes INSIDE and seen plenty of employees. My order was wrong twice. Absolutely cold food. Sent a complaint to corporate because this is unacceptable. This location is full of tourist and I hate for these people visiting our state and area to be treated the way I was. Absolutely uncalled for!",0
"Food was cold drinks missing
The manager is rude the advertising is false. She accused us of lieing when we said we weren't asked about the rewards to receive the free cookie.  Very hostile !",0
Not satisfied with purchase. Female manager messed up my order twice. My tripple hamburger looked like someone added two miniature paddies on a normal size burger. I would recommend that this supervisor pays attention to receipts and ask for additional help in order to avoid mistakes.,0
"If I could I would give -10 stars because I stayed here in Orlando all week and they never wanted to take my order, they locked all the doors at night, they say they close at 11pm and for example I arrived at 9:40 and they told me that it was closed, please McDonald do something, this is happening to me all nights, Im from Mexico and I dont have a car or the App from here (even if its the same is different) they are rude and not attentive.

Lost our order. Waited 45 min for a burger fries and a box of nuggets. Then they accuse us of trying to get a duplicate order for Free. They clearly have problems.  We tossed a twenty dollar bill at them and asked for the food. NEVER GO to this location.  EVER,0
Nasty Shift manager and drive thru lady treat customers like a burden nonsense of customer service. Kitch n always Dirty. I definitely would not suggest coming here.,0
Ordered the curbside orders but waited around 20 mins since the staff totally forgot to take the meals out??? I ordered regular iced latte but got suuuuper sweet latte instead. Even got the overcooked bun on my muffin! Worst experience!,0
"Horrible! Management isn professional at all, a ma",0
While sitting down eating. A manager was arguing with an elderly gentleman. Very disrespectful. Will never got black again.,0
"Lst night the cashier wouldnt assist in exchanging a nugget meal for a nugget happy meal due to their broken kiosk misplaced the order. Neither would sell the toy itself to help a child get their wanted toy instead sold a seperate happy meal box! Coffe was cold too!

Next day went bck hoping to get a different experience... the guy on the floor was really nice and polite but the middle eastern cashiers.... not so much!!!! Im standing their waiting to be assisted but instead the latina looking and the middle eastern had a more important conversation of how to remove her nose piercing and how to clean it! Also she was manipulating her nose while at the csshier! So so disgusting!!! Grosss!!!!!",0
"Having to pay for a cup of water is outrageous. $2 for a cup of water should not be the norm. Who do they think they are, Nestle?",0
I ordered the 2 for 4.49 crispy chicken biscuits for breakfast and they gave me the 2 for 3 mc chicken sandwich and then when I asked the manager Monica.why was i charged so much for sandwiches I didn't order she told me that she was short-staffed and didn't have time to fix it and gave me an attitude.,0
this mcdonald's is not open 24 hours despite all signage and hours posted. an employee rudely shooed me away when i showed up at 1:30 AM.,0

Horrible service !  Made an mobile order and it took forever  to be ready . I end it up leaving without my order and you can not cancel the the order thru the app. I'll never comeback on this location.,0
"Terrible service,we have to go back 3  times since they forgot my big mac   , bbq's
Sauce  sweet sour souce  ,and my large order  fries with only half full.  The last thing is herzelnut iced coffee  with none flavor that I have to dumped away after first dip.  The most important thing is The only one staff seems so mad at work. When she doing the fries,one empty fries bag dropped on the floor,she got so pissed  threw a whole bunch fries bag on the floor.  She seems the manager, no other staff dared to point this out. They all just keep silent and clean the mess. If you are not in the mood ,go home plz. When comes to customer service, be nice then . That is the priority of your duty and responsibility.",0
"A Big Dog was unleashed in the restaurant. Seriously? I love animals, but I have some allergy reactions.",0
The lady at the drive-thru window was so rude and angry (for no reason) that I cancelled my order and drove away. The lady would only answer with one word answers and was not even polite. Drove to BurgerKing across the street where I was treated nicely and my order was completed with no problems or childish employees.,0
"Large capuchino???? The second picture with the flash light was other day, take your own review about it, IT IS A ",0
Person was very rude gave me the wrong order and the food was cold check the food back and got my money back,0
Made an order online. Arrived 15 later. The place was packed. We waited 50 minutes in the store for our food. We got the wrong nugget sauces. We were missing 2 LG fries and 2 LG sweet t's. The manager behind the counter was very rude to the customers. This place is a wreck.,0
Very rude!!! I came early morning today and no one came over speaker. I watched them hand the car in front me food out the window. But yet they paid no mind to me being outside the window. They passed by and didn say a word or even acknowledge I was there but yet several employees passed by and saw me. Even if you were closed despite sign stating 24 hrs the lease you could do is have some decency and say something. Really poor service. T,0
"Companies need to understand it's not 2020 anymore. The public is tired of your excuses. Be aware this location starts breakfast at 4am however during late hours they shut their systems down meaning they only take cash, and mobile orders are not accepted, and the mobile app is not updated to make yiuu aware of this. Maybe it's legit, seems shady though. If anything it is poor management. It is understandable to shut down system during slower times if need be. But you should have it ready to go by time your breakfast hours start, and the mobile app should not be accepting orders.",0
"Automated McDonald's don't expect excellent customer service, food is always mediocre.",0
Asked for a large water when they brought my order to my table.  And she never came back.,0
"I GIVE IT 2 STARS because they were quick.But on the other hand,The fries were cold,and the burgers were drenched with ketchup. Told the gentleman to hold one moment and 5 seconds later a girl came on. Like give us a minute. I normally don't write a review and I hate to leave a bad one.But you would think because it's in front of oldtown it's hot and fresh. Just got out of the hospital wanted a warm meal.",0
"Waited 34 minutes to pick up our order, and of course it was wrong and cold. Poorly managed, I do not recommend this location.",0
"I have worked at a McDonald and I have never seen such disrespect, Lack of communication and unprofessional from a manger in my life. I had a Uber eats order and called 15 minutes before to make sure that it was able to be picked up and when they answered the phone I asked my question and I got hung up on not once but three times. When I arrived and have waited in the line the man taking the orders in the drive through said our Uber order would be ready at the second window. When we got there the manger told us no orders for Uber were available. When I asked if he could double check he said that we would have to go back in line and that he was busy. I understand if there is system issues but I ",0
"Couldn't even order. I was greeted at the drive thru with ""we're only taking one order at a time, there are 2 people in front of you, I'll get to you when I can"" so I thought maybe they were severely understaffed. After 20 minutes at the speaker waiting, I pulled off without ever being spoken to again, to find at least 6 or 7 staff members kind of just hanging out inside, surely not moving the drive thru line along.",0
"Most unprofessional and rude mcdonalds I have ever been to.
I recently went to this Mcdonalds and order 2 quarter pounders with cheese with no ketchup or tomatoes because I have an allergy and a large coke. When I got to work I'm happy that I checked it before I bite into it because it had both. When I called them and spoke to the manager I was asked my name and to come back and they would replace it. I couldn't make it back that day because I was at work so I called the next day and left them know my name and I was going to go by and get the replacement and they said that I was ok to pick it up. Not even 5 minutes later the manager called me back and told me that I couldn't go pick it back up. When I said the manager said it was OK the person that called me back said it was a different manager that I talked to and thistles manager said absolutely not. Which it was the same manager. Like how unprofessional and rude this mcdonalds was.",0
"Be Aware!

Always a problem in this branch! Either order is wrong, or missing key ingredients in burgers (like ketchup for example), or stale meat ingredients, or the high prices, or the 45 -60 minutes long lines, etc.. What broke the camel back for me was when some customers would skip the drive thru line and when speaking to the McDonald's manager, I was told there's nothing they can do about it. Very bad area to be in for sure. Ghetto employees and ghetto customers. Better to drive couple more miles either way on 192 than to come here!",0
Took 20 minutes to order then they messed up are order charged us for there mess up. Questioned the price they gave us a hard time just to get the receipt to prove them wrong. That took  another 10 minutes.,0

"We have visited this McDonald twice now using the drive through. It took forever both times - the car in front only ordering 1 or 2 items! First time it took around 10 minutes to order and then we had to wait for the food another 10 minutes.
Second time too",0
"Not greeted when entering, employees refused to acknowledge us while we waited to order just to be told by another guest that we have to use the kiosk. An employee walking to the bathroom confirmed this. Kiosk doesn't accept cash and touch screen was not responsive. Decided to go to drive-thru and waited a few minutes just to pull off and go to chick-fil-a where they still know how to serve it's customers.",0
"Raw meat! Dont go here, second time happened to me",0

"The food is no good for you since I have found out since the last time I reviewed this that there is pork in their hamburger I will not be going there anymore I should sue them as what I should do I haven't ate pork in 20 years!!!! very disappointing, and you would think a big establishment like this could get turkey bacon or turkey sausage",0
"They forgot my ice cream but I went back and got it. The line is very long weekends so go during the week. The curbside pickup is excellent. I am appending my review, this is the second time I ordered and they forgot an item. This McDonald is beyond busy ",0
l've paid for hot drinks but they didn't have hot drinks. So funny. Than they return my money in to my bank account but less than l have paid. They didn't refund as full amount,0
"horrible horrible horrible manager at night. unfortunatly i didnt catch her name but shes the oldest one in the night shift atleast on most days when i come. today is 5/9/2022, and its 12:10am, and all i did was ask her if my order was still there cuz on my screen it disappeared and she just kept saying, U GOTTA KEEP WAITING, so i said, i dont mind waiting i just want to know if my order is on ur side cuz it disappeared on my side and she rolled her eyes and said, LIKE I SAID YOU HAVE TO KEEP WAITING!!!!! and its not the first time this happens. i was here one day when she yelled at a customer saying, I TOLD YOU UR APPLE PIES ARENT READY YET!!! that someone else went up to her and told her she needs to calm herself down. so disrespectful and rude and she should not be working anywhere where it involves guests cuz obviously she has no patience. you can ask her for some ketchup and she rolls her eyes right ahead!",0
"Don't eat here! Order is always wrong, takes forever, fries are cold and gross. Dining room ""closes"" at 11pm. NOPE! Really closes at like 8pm. Update the hours on your door!!! When we knocked on the door and pointed to the sign, THE MANAGER FLIPPED US OFF!

Cooperate needs to fire most the staff, all the managers, and get new people in there.",0
DO NOT GO HERE!  This was the most unprofessional treatment that we ever received by McDonald's. We felt like we couldn't even report it because we didn't have a name to call up the next day and speak to a manager he wouldn't even give us a name,0
Have to order by computer and no one to help. Asked for no mustard and crispy fries.  Had 6 worker's talking about a ring instead of just looking at me as I asked for help. Bathroom are nasty.  Won't go back again.,0
Insanely busy line around the building for the drive through out the door for walk in and order ridiculously busy customer service was friendly but order was wrong and took a long time to complete maybe they just need more employees on a Sunday morning my family is :-(,0
The drive through guy was super disrespectful and awful to deal with. We had ordered online and they said it didn't go through even though it charged us so instead of providing a solution he stood staring not saying anything. As well as when we got the food and asked if that was all and he rolled his eyes and said nothing. Absolutely one of the worst experiences in a drive through. 0,0
Lines longer than Disney. Staff walk around clueless half the time. Not sure if understaffed or undertrained. Corporate needs to come and take a look at this one or shut it down. Been this way for years now. Always the same. Always cash only at night.,0
Was visiting for a few weeks. Got coffee plenty of times and was correct maybe twice to three times.,0
"Used a deal at the kiosk for a free kids meal w/ combo purchase and when I went to check out it said ""Deal is unavailable"" & wiped out the order forcing me to re-enter everything and the deal code was now invalid. I get that they are for ""participating locations"", but if you're not a participating location, put up a sign or something so I don't waste my time.
The drink fountain was closed 'to keep the restaurant clean' according to the sign so I went to the counter and asked for a refill and the manager said ""We don't do refills here"". What? Seriously? Unlike every other McDonald's? You're gonna give me the saltiest fries ever and then make me pay for a refill? Again, if that is this location's policy, fine. But post a sign so that the expectation is set",0
"One of my favorite features of McDonald's for me is that I know what I can expect; offerings, flavors, etc.
This is true for this particular restaurant, however, it seems that being soooo busy (I guess excellent location) makes them impervious to concerns about customer service or satisfaction of their customers.

Running out of lettuce, running out ""of many things"", are management/logistics problems. Bad attitude, lack of courtesy, well I guess that problem is on us, the customers, right?

The two stars are for do providing the best breakfast sandwich in the market still, regardless of attitude and bad manners.",0

"Just went to this location. Worst service I ever had! I was unable to process my orden with the Kiosk. After I couldn't make the order I was standing at the line and the employee said all orders needed to be thru the Kiosk. I told them I tried it and was unable to complete the order and I prefer (wanted) to do it thru cashier. Manager Jennifer was rude and said that if I wanted to do it with a cashier I had to do it via drive thru. To be honest, that is totally disrespectful and unprofessional. Where is the customer service or Customer Service satisfaction?? You can not force your customers to do only kiosk!!!! What about people that can't read??? Are they not allowed to go inside the restaurant just because they can't make the order at the kiosk??",0
"Self ordering stations inside offer a milk alternative for coffee and that's what we (thought we) got. Went through the drive through to be told they dont offer such a thing.

My husband had to get her attention to finish explaining that the menu inside has it on there. She was slightly aggressive,  we left.",0
"Order was wrong despite using ordering terminal and salad had large section that was inedible, see the picture. Looked like the lettuce had been out of date for a month. Took forever as well!",0
"24 hours, it's a joke right?
I arrived from my trip at 3:00am today 02/26/22 and the cashier notified me to wait.
After 30 minutes without attending to me in the self-service line, I decided to check if there was someone to attend me and nobody came out or said anything.  It is a lack of respect.",0
They won't take my order I had to use the self serving one n they didnt take our food to the table as the number thingy said,0
"Fries were good and hot. I also got the crispy chicken  sandwich. It was hot but  seemed like they forgot to season it as it was very bland and basically had no taste at all. The only thing I tasted was the two pickles on the sandwich. I definitely will not get this sandwich again here. I have to say overall ordering the crispy chicken sandwich at any McDonald's is a major gamble. I have gotten it once or twice before when it was really good but more often than not it has not been good at all... Bland, burnt, dry, etc .. take my advice don't get the c",0
"My quarter pounder with cheese was old, cold and dry.",0
"Our order was incorrect. We ordered a Big Mac meal - with a large coke and a medium caramel frappe. We were handed a medium coke with the meal and frappe. When we said the coke was supposed to be large, the worker (Manager) asked for the receipt, which shows:
1 Big Mac Ml-Lrg
1 M Coke
Then she said: You have to ask for a large- We did!! She didn't offer to correct their error.
When do you ever order a large meal with a medium drink????? The fry was a large, but they were cold. The Big Mac was dry. I forgot why we don't usually go to McDonald's. Thank you for reminding me.",0
No contact with the workers till they delivered.  Basically you were ignored unless you yelled loudly for attention.  Very disappointed and will never visit there again. Remover the kiosk in order to give a one on one personal touch.  Even a good morning!!! GO BACK TO COUNTER HELP PLEASE,0
"There were people inside but they were closed, but they did sell food, only that I could not buy because I did not have a car. If they are open for take away they should not DISCRIMINATE someone because he does not have a car.",0
Drive thru is the biggest mistake.  They Assured me everything was in the bag.  And nope no 20 piece chicken nuggets ,0
"Worst McDonald's I have ever been to. The food was dry, we had to ask for our drinks three times and we had to ask for the Happy Meal toy. There was one helpful young woman working front cash, who got the last drink sorted out. But won't be back unless management starts checking in and doing a better job motivating employees.",0
"We stopped in for a midday snack since we were across the street at Fun Spot of America.  I placed a mobile order, the cashier didn know that.. after standing there for 5 minutes he finally said mobile order 1634.. I raised my hand and he slide me the bag. Never",0
I just want to warn people that they have a beautiful playground that you can see from the outside...but it closed. ,0
"Terrible.... 1st- no cashier, they force us to use the non user friendly kiosk.
2nd- why ask us to take a table number if you don't deliver the food.
3rd- 6 dirty tables.
Don't you forget they are many other fast food options....",0
"Says 24 hour drive through. They're always closed, shut down, doing maintenance, only cash, systems are down, or some other reasons why they can't serve the early risers. They shouldn't post on the signa that the drive through is open just to not serve anyone or have it on maps that they are open just to refuse customers.",0
Worst ever spent 45 minutes in line and then they never took my order through the intercom finally made it to the front they took forever to give me my order then get home to see a combo missing UGH then I call to complain and they never answered the phone!!!! Horrible management,0
I sat in drive through Tuesday night around 11:30 PM for 20 minutes and pull up to order and associate says sorry we are closed I explained to him that I had been waiting already for over 20 minutes and he mumbled something and said sorry the website says open 24hrs,0
It is unfortunate what I experienced in that place. A man entered in his wheelchair just to charge his chair battery to continue on his way.  and the manager of that store took him out of the place it was inhumane what she did with that poor person,0
"Hey, we just left this place. Had a big order - lots of people hungry after getting to town late. Among other things, we ordered 3 orders of 20 nuggets, 4 large fries, a bunch of dbl cheeseburgers and a quarter pounder. Know what we got? A drink we didn't order, an apple pie we didn't order, an ice cream we didn't order, and one 10 piece nugget. In a big bag that looked enough like one that would hold our order - our bad, I guess, but our not checking closely enough just doesn't excuse just not getting 40+ $ worth of food. And then they don't answer when we try to call. Absolutely terrible store.",0
The people in this place could not get any more Dumber. Made it a point to order by the number on the menu board and they still are able to screw that up. Super great place to visit if your intention is to go through the drive-thru then have to park and go inside and fix your order each time.,0
"They were very rude and food was cold. They refuse to let us inside and made us wait 10 mins for three sandwiches and when it was time to get the food two people were VERY RUDE. Next time I'm in town I'll never go to this McDonald's. They were slow, rude, and not friendly.",0
Food was cold. Cheese wasn't melted on burger. Is that all is that all is that all is that all after every item u order. I will tell that's all when I'm done ordering. Wow customer service is really bad everywhere these days.,0
Very bad so gross  didn't do clean up ,0
Went at night at the request of my son since we had a very long day of driving. Bad move on our part. Ordered a filet. It was totally hard. Not just the bread. The fish was a hockey puck. Very nasty. Had to throw it out. The fries were the back up....thank goodness for those at least!  We also waited too long on line but his nuggets and fries were okay.,0
This is the only McDonald I know that decid,0
"Terrible customer service.....ordered from the kiosk, was the only person waiting at the counter and not one person acknowledged me. To make matters worse, the manager was assisting in fulfilling orders instead of delegating her employees. While they stood and had conversation I waited 15 min before I received a ""Did you order?"" Not even the management acknowledged me....can't expect good service if the management doesn't know how to give it!",0
They never seems to get our order right . Thank God we always check our food and for some reason I always have to go inside and they get in an attitude. So we will not be returning nor recommending to any of our friends or family,0
I had the worst experience at this location. I went to the drive thru and only ordered 2 hamburgers and a small fry. I paid and pulled up to get my food and was given the wrong order. I let the associate know it wasn't correct. He had me pull up to the wait window to get my correct food. As I sat and waited time was just ticking by. After 15 minutes of patiently waiting I wanted my food. No one came back. I knocked on the glass and no response. As about the 10th car received there food at the window behind me I had to get out of the car and walk back to that window as it was late and the inside was closed. I asked where my food was and he said he was making it. I asked for a refund and was given my slip refund a total of 28 minutes after first paying. I went back in the next day to speak with a manager to let them know that this happened. I had my receipt with the time and the refund receipt with the time 28 minutes later. He said oh I'm sorry they're new. Terrible customer service and uncaring management.,0
"Service was trash, took them 20 minutes to take my order (no exaggerations... Seriously), can't even salt fries for some reason, and the employees weren't able to organize correctly. For example, at one point, there were three employees gathered around to fill one order. ONE ORDER!!!! Seriously??? I'd recommend going somewhere else then to spend your time and money here.",0
Worst MCdonalds experience ever. 40 minutes and counting and no order. Don't ever stop here unless you want to get extremely mad,0
"Waited in the drive thru for literally an hour. If we weren't trapped in line and had been able to leave we would have. They didn't give us any napkins and got our order wrong. The cashier said it's ""always like this"". Absolutely not acceptable. Especially for a McDonald's. Did they forget what FAST food means!?",0
Service was terrible wouldn't allowed to use the app couldn't redeem point wouldn't let us use gift card I think they were pocketing the cash they overcharged us and forgot Burger,0
"I'm sorry to give only one star. But during our visit were in the children's area 7 of 7 tables or seats are not clean. It was uncomfortable for me to sit there. There were many spots to see, unappetizing. if the area for the guests looks like, how is it in the kitchen. I do not want to imagine it. I will not go there a second time.",0
I placed my order at 7:33pm tonight and got the order at about 8:15pm.  I had to call to make sure they received my order. Apparently they either forgot or overlooked it.  Usually they would throw in a free item to make you happy..   not this place.,0
"This was the worst McDonald's I've been in. We ordered using the kiosk and  they had numbers to pick up and take to your table where they would deliver your food. We waited 20 minutes for the food and it was dropped on our table without any courtesy. The coffee I ordered was missing as was the cup for my husband's drink. He went to the counter to get it and they didn't believe him at first. My coffee had the label on it for what I'd ordered but it didn't have any sugar in it so I added one and stirred it, took a sip and got a mouthful of grounds. The egg and sausage mcmuffin was cold as were the hash browns and  the coffee was tepid. I assume it had been ready quite a while before it was delivered. Usually when I get this meal things are quite hot. The whole thing was pretty dissatisfying and put me off McDonald's for a while. The staff didn't seem to be receptive to complaints so I made an online complaint on the McDonald's website and we left.",0
"I placed an order about an hour ago only to find out that half of my order was missing. I called this location to let them know that I was missing half my order. The manager, Judith, stated that if I don't come before 4am them I'd have to wait until the next day to receive my order. Although I do understand that their menu items are schedule based, I think its highly unprofessional to turn their problem into mine. I understand that my items were not available after that time, but she was extremely unhelpful in finding a solution to the problem they created. I asked to speak to a manager and was told the manager is on vacation. The call ended with her stating that she does not have time to deal with my problem because they are ""too busy"".",0
"I want to apologize to anyone that I recommended this particular McDonald's to in the past.
This was the restaurant that I used to recommend to tourists when they were looking for a fast place to eat that was away from the Disney parks, but still close enough to get back to the parks quickly. At that time, it was worth it. The menu was cheap (or at least what you know to expect from a international chain) and, since it's a chain, you know what the food is gong to be like.
So, let's look at what you need to do if you are a member of a chain of restaurants. You need to set yourself apart with your service. This WAS the reason I used to recommend this restaurant. Sadly, I don't think they care anymore. The last time we went, half of the kiosks weren't working. One of the three that was, didn't print receipts. (This plays a part into why the service was so atrocious. Actually there was a lot that played into it.) Now, if you've gone to McDonald's at all recently, you know you pick your food at the kiosk, get a number that you take to your table, pay at the kiosk, sit down and wait for your food. Typically all of that takes about five minutes. Well, this day (and what I've garnered from tourists and locals, on many other days) the team at work decided they weren't going to bring the food to the table. That would have been fine if there was any indication ANYWHERE, but of course that would have been a form of service so that didn't happen. After about 15 minutes of trying to find a place where we could all sit together (only a slight exaggeration) we were told by other customers that were leaving that they weren't calling numbers and you had to wait at the counters.
Ok... So I go up to the counter and wait. We get our food 40 minutes later, and there were the obligatory mess ups that we had to get corrected. No big deal, we are used to this.
My in-laws are visiting and at this point I'm trying to figure why they haven't received their order. It dawned on me  that my father in-law doesn't have a receipt (remember the machine that wasn't printing receipts?).
The person calling numbers is calling the number on the receipt, not the tent number. Apparently, my in-laws food was ready in a master of minutes (amazing since that is all customized) and placed in the ""abandoned order"" area. If we hadn't said anything, they would never have received their food. The lady never once called a tent number. We told another person of the lack of receipt problem. That information never got transmitted to the person calling the numbers. When we spoke with her and told her their was no receipt, she asked us what the receipt number was. We had the tent card in hand and pointed at the receipt plastered on the ice cream machine, and she asked again for the receipt.
Aside from the travesty that was the most important thing a restaurant is to do, the place looked like a slightly cleaned up version of a break room at a local dump. I'm not sure if they just didn't staff well on this shift, but like I said, I've talked to a few tourists and locals and they all say it had been this way a while.",0
"Hands down the worst McDonald I퐒e ever experienced. Rudest employees. Lady in drive-thru looked like a manager and was infuriatingly rude and just a horrible person!! The young girl at the register refused to acknowledge me turned her head and walked right by as I tried to ask for help! Other people ordered, ate, and finished there food while I stood there unacknowledged for over 10 minutes waiting for 2 double cheeseburgers and a fry. A guy was just leaning on the counter doing nothing and walked away when I said I could not wait any longer. Never got my money back a",0
"The only reason that I stoped to buy at McDonald's was because of my youngest daughter. But what we experienced today put an end to it. The employees at this location did not maintain an order serving  customers in the drive thru area. As you noticed, there are two lines in the drive thru and they are supposedly serve in a first come first serve basis but that was not the case. The associate, instead of been polite, talked to us in a not too pleasant tone. I did not wanted to make things worst so we placed our order and moved on to pay and pick up. Luckily the manager was close by and had the opportunity to address the experience. I hope they take this opportunity to improve their customer service skills and provide customers a much pleasant experience.",0
"Really slow service, took over 15 minutes to receive the food,  after it had been delivered to another table.

When it did arrive, the chicken and burger were cold. Duly sent back, to be fair they were remade and brought pretty quick, but no apology.",0
Take the extra 5 minutes to go to a different location!!!! My entire order was incorrect and stuffed into one bag which broke 2 seconds after it was handed to me. The person who took my order was more interested in rushing me then looking to see if it was correct. Went inside to speak with a manger and turns out she was the one who bagged my order! I then got screamed at by some young wanna be Rico suave who should퐒e been in the kitche,0
"I stopped here yesterday for a quick breakfast on my way to work. I got a bacon, egg and cheese mcgriddle, the hash brown and a caramel frappe. I ended up with food poisoning ",0
"Ridiculous.. i am not one to ridicule, this is pure ridiculousness... I should not have to check behind people that are begging for higher wages and they can't even get a kids meal right... you forgot the nuggets and I also ordered fries and apples... I received  double fries,  no nuggets, as well as missing the sauces that were to accompany the nuggets. I tried calling when I arrived back. No one answered the phone!!! Here is your negative review that could've been rectified with you answering the phone to address these issues",0
"Slowest McDonald's I have ever been to in my life. Took an hour just to order in drive thru... Then took another 20 minutes just to get our food (orders 2 burgers, apple pie, and 20pc nugget so shouldn't have taken to long at all",0
"Busy, under staffed, slow service, condiment stand a mess, out of lids, ketchup dispenser broken.  I ordered to eat in and my food was delivered to my table in a to go bag!  Why take a number and have an associate bring a to go bag to the table????  Very,  very ill-run and poorly  managed location.  Just  awful.",0
I should never have to wait more than 5 to 10 minutes for fast food. Waiting for over 20 minutes in the line now and I still haven't gotten my food. I understand this is Midsummer but they knew this was coming before hand. They should have the staff and the facilities to handle the business demand. This McDonalds sucks,0
Unnecessary long wait time in drive thru. Drive thru is built for double cars and double pick up windows but still stayed behind 4 cars for 30 minutes. Only waited due to long drive home with kids in the car. Rude staff as well. Really wish I had noticed the Burger King across the street earlier. I would have even settled for checkers across the street and that's saying a lot because I don't think anyone willingly eats at checkers,0
"I have ordered many times from this mcdonalds, how do you screw up a cheeseburger? I asked for no ketchup, no mustard, no pickles, no onion. I got no condiments and NO MEAT! I mean really, learn to read and pay attention. This is my 3rd time this has happened.",0
"Extremely rude and impatient. I asked for 3 water cups with my 40$ meal and I got a glare and only one cup.  Then my brother who ordered a 20 piece nugget went up to ask for sauce because they didn't include any that we asked for, after waiting patiently and then asking several times he got 2 of the 4 he asked for.  He came back frustrated with only 2 so I told him to go back for more. He asked the manager 4 times to her face very nicely for 2 more and she just looked at him each time and went the other way. Eventually a kind fellow customer next to him reached over the counter and just took sauce for my brother. Not impressed",0
Double check your orders. I got someone else order and when i took it back. The employee placed it back to give it to someone else. I told her I touched the burger to throw it away. She looked at my face and lie that she threw it away. Horrible attitude from the cashier. Order was not completed.,0
Female cashier was rude and was very unprofessional. If you are a tourist and don't know when it is cash only you don't get a receipt do not yell at the customer like we supposed to know what is going on. The only good thing about going was lemuel he was a great help. I would not want the girl to serve us with that attitude.,0
"Long line at kisok, which was only way to order due to lack of staff. Difficulty using my coupon since ordered from kiosk. Tea was weak, had been sitting awhile. Terrible experience",0
"Worst customer service ever!! I was invited to come in after having to wait over 45 minutes on the drive thru. Manager Priscilla calls me to apologize and invites me back with my family, I explained I cannot come back next day, but would come following Sunday, she agreed and hung up. On Sunday I come to the restaurant and there is another manager Cynthia who I explained the situation and she grunted the whole time she took the order. While on the service line, she tries to contact the manager and right there from behind the line, she asks me yelling, what is your name, I tell her and again in front of EVERYONE, other customers included, yells again, ""she tells me you came in already!!"" I replied NO, at this point I'm embarrassed and upset and I hear her that she tells the person on the phone I already put it down. Twenty minutes later, I finally get the order. I ask her to change the fries on some of the things that were ready because they were cold. The manager grunts and agrees to. After my family were done with their meals, we had ordered ice cream and we asked to hold off until we were done. When we returned, we asked for the ice cream and we had asked for chocolate, they said that we had ordered vanilla and the manager gave us one less of what we ordered. Incredible! Bottom line, we were invited to come back to make it up for bad service and McDonald's came through, we got yelled at by the manager, embarrased, long wait for food, missing food items, and pissy attitude by staff. Next time I get invited back I guess I gotta read the fine print or ask for what am I invited to come back for. Sorry that we don't have negative stars because this location would take them all.",0
Only go here because it's open late. Food not always the same presentation or great tasting..but it is McDonald's. What do you expect.... You know when you go there what you're getting. Cheap food..poor customer service.. And maybe your order correct.,0

"All I had was a hot fudge sundae, which was good. The restaurant did not have running water at the time though so I was unable to wash my hands in the bathroom or to order a soda. They legally should not have been open. They were still running things as usual though.",0
"Showed up 20 minutes before the menu change and was told I couldn't order what I wanted off of the advertised menu. When I question that to the employee they basically said they were too underpaid and lazy to make me chicken nuggets and all I could have was the two mcChicken sandwiches they had left... Or nothing.

Great customer service... NOT",0
"If it were possible to leave 0 stars I would. Absolutely zero customer service. The only interaction with both guys at the drive thru was when the order was placed, neither of them spoke a word in person. The guy at the payment window was too busy talking with the guy who would be the person to push the food out of the window and he couldn't be bothered to tell us which of the 2 pick up windows to stop at. I would say that the behavior could have been excused if they were busy, but they weren't at all. Yet even being busy doesnt excuse the gross lack of basic human interaction.",0
"As usual the food prep people don't know how to read a order slip. Big mac no sauce no cheese.
What did I get? Big Mac cheese ONLY on it.
Ya'll did make it thru first grade so you could read simple 3-5 letter words? Right?
Just asking.",0
The manager Judith is extremely rude. She gave us cold meals we said excuse me she looked at us and walked away. 6 minutes later she came back to me after leaving me standing there just stared at me and I told her 폠퐉 sorry my food is cold?she turned around grabbed me a new wrap handed it to me and walked away. Never saying a word. We had a second order and still had to wait. It is ,0
Just horrible service.. this is probably my first review ever and sucks it had to be a negative one.. if you don't like your job then it's best you quit without bringing down the company with you.. lady in the drive thru window at this hour was making fun of patrons trying to order and I happened to overhear. Not something you want to hear when ordering to be honest,0
There is a theme with drive thru only restaurant's cold food and watered down drinks and if don't check your bags well enough before you drive away and your order is wrong you can't just walk back inside and get it fixed you have get back in line and start all over again! Open up the lobby people,0
"If Mc D thinks Kiosk service is the future, I would SELL My Stock!
Probably the Worst Mc D experience I have Ever had...",0
This place is ridiculously high compared to the McDonald's just down the street. $20 for what is normally $10. On top of it didn't even ask if I wanted any sauces with my chicken McNuggets. Do yourself a favor and drive the extra couple of miles to any other McDonald's,0
So disappointed... I entered this restaurant only to be confronted with a computer taking my order..  which was Not working!! No one noticed we were having difficulty.  So frustrating. Wont come here again for a long time!,0

"This location has slow service and horrible customer service.  The computer order machine was not working,  instead of informing custmers they said nothing. Orders were backed up and the staff acted like nothing was wrong. What kind of training is McDonalds giving their employees.  For such a big business  and being involved in so many charities you think , they would emphasize excellent customer service. McDonalds you are slipping.",0
This McDonald's was the worst i haver ever been in.  ZERO STARS. Floor in entrance was flooded. Bathrooms disgusting. Soda bar dirty and filthy with no ice. Garbage cans over flowing. 12 to 15 people inside with one person working the register. This after sitting in drive through fir 5 to 8 minutes without moving.,0
What is the point in having employees in a store if they don't help you? The employees talking to each other and when you want to place an order they tell you to place it on the machine. The store was empty! What are they there for if the machine is going to take your order? They are getting paid to chit chat? Bad customer service.,0
"Thought it would be a standard mcd however after placing our order and putting the table number for the meal to be delivered to us, it wasn. We went to counter to find part of the order sitting there then we were given the order with a lot of items missing",0
Got the order wrong. Went back. They told me to pull up 2nd window.  They forgot me. Then got the order wrong again.,0
If you like to sit in the pick up line for 20 minutes and when you finally get your food it is not at all what you ordered then this is the place for you.,0

"The facility is a contemporary fast food restaurant with self ordering stations; making orders fast and reliable. Notwithstanding, the manager needs to work in interpersonal tact with her staff.

All I ordered was a a double cheese meal and a happy meal and you couldn't get either one right even after a 15 minute wait. Completely unacceptable.",0
If I could rate a 0 I would. I didn't even get my order because I had to wait so long. What fast food experience EVER!,0

"Absolutely Terrible Food ! No OPTIONS for Anything even remotely Healthy,  The staff is polite,  but McDonald's You WILL continue to lose business!  People are finally looking at All the disgusting ingredients that's in the production of your food.

Seems like the more one goes to this location...the worse it gets....toasting an English muffin should not be a difficult task... it wouldn't be bad....but lying about toasting it .......Shame on them.....apparently after a certain hour it is..not a priority to make decent food for the public......or decent fries...not to mention a double cheeseburger... simply gross.. Good grief....this place is certainly disappearing from my list of quick stops...to keep going by  cause Checkers is right down the road...,0

"I have been staying at the Holiday Inn next door to the McDonald's for four days now. Every morning we walk over to McDonald's to get bacon, egg, and cheese biscuits and hash browns. EVERY SINGLE MORNING that we've went over there, we have gotten hard, rubbery, cold, biscuits. Their hash browns are hard as well, and there is so much grease that it runs down your fingers when you pick it up.

I called the manager and she was very polite and replaced my breakfast with ""better biscuits"". However, the replacement biscuits were undercooked. They were very doughy. I do not recommend this place to anyone. The convenience to the hotel is not worth the terrible food.",0
"Just went and got 4 McChicken, 1 Large French fry a medium one and a cheeseburger.

I visited this McDonalds on my way home from Walt disney world with my kids 8 and 13. I went through the drive through so I could get back on the road to get home our order was not right onions on everything we asked for no onion and short a French fry. Also has no ketchup in the bag and I asked for more because our kids use a lot and was told no it was in the bag. I do not recommend the drive through.,0
Horrible service. General manager was in the store at the time. Was punishing an employee in front of everybody. Should've been more professional and took him in the back area. I waited 10 minutes no one in front of me and no one in the drive thru and my food still was not fresh. Don't recommend this location unless you can't get to a different location.,0
"Very busy,  mad customers, long wait times for orders.  The staff is trying their best but can't keep up.  They need a new streamlined process and only one conductor.",0
"I guess when you're in a tourist area you don't have to worry about pleasing your local customers for return business. Stale burger buns, cold and burnt french fries.  Medium fries box was about 2/3 full.  Drive thru employee didn't say two words to me beyond the price of my meal.",0
I went through the drive-thru at this location and ordered a big Mac a large fry two McDoubles as well as a medium caramel frappe however when I return to my room the big Mac was missing as well as the cookies so I drove back up to the location I've now been sitting here over 20 minutes and nobody has come outside to let me know what was going on I would highly recommend finding another McDonald's to go to seeing as they don't seem to care about their customers,0
"The worst McDonald's I've been to! Went in around 10 maybe 11 at night after visiting disney on the way back to our hotel. Went inside because the drive through line had at least 10 cars, no big deal. I was ordering a carryout. Anyways they forgot the chicken nuggets for the 10 piece chicken nugget meal. I wasnt about to bring my two little ones back out so I called the store. I told them what had happend and said I would be back sometime tomorrow afternoon and to just get it then (my boys love McDonald's) she said that would be fine and she would be there the next day. I asked her name but it couldn't really understand what she said because she was talking fast. Anyways I go back the day and told the lady at the drive through what happend, she didn't know what to do and had to get a manager the manager comes on and asks who I spoke to and I told her I didn't remember but she said to bring my receipt in and she would take care of it. Manager didn't believe me. I ended up just buying another one and I know its literally only a few dollars but it was the principal.",0
"Quarter pound CB although made correctly with no onions was raw in the middle (not noticed until my husband was already almost done eating) then he just threw it away, hopefully he does not get sick. Kids meal CB ordered with no onions (not rang up that way) was covered in onions! Lessons here: cook outs not being done to make sure on quality & not serving raw product & cashier needs a little more training....because when I ordered my CB kids meal with no onions & a Large diet cook as the drink. He did not put on there the no onions & then asked me what did I want to drink.",0
"It's really ridiculous that I'm coming every day for my breakfast at this branch and they don't care about customer satisfied, every morning I ordered 2 hot coffe and they gave me cold one! Again and again it happened",0
"If I could give it NO STARS, I would!!  We waited MORE then 20 mins (inside) for our breakfast!  Ok. I can see if you are that busy & need to make the food...after 30 minutes we got cold food & the hashbrowns were so dripping in grease (and cold)....disgusting!",0
"Morons running the restaurant. The $6 meal is a rip off. We asked if we could get the same deal but sub a side salad. They said yes then they over charged us and yold us ""oh no substitutions."" Watch your tickets and repeat your order three times so the cashier and shift supervisor understand what you actually want.",0
1st night in Orlando in vacation. Drive thru was packed so we went inside. Waited for 10 minutes and manager said lobby was now closed and we had to leave,0
"The girl who takes the payments is SO RUDE! If you hate your job, look for something else or at least treat people nice.",0
This is quite possibly one of the worst mcdonalds I have ever been to. Multiple times we have ordered mobile and whenever there is an issue the manager on duty blames us. He even felt the need to come out to my car and berate me over it.,0
"During the Daytime its alright, but at night they block one of the entrances with trash cans and lock the other one. (EVEN THOUGH THE SIGN STATES 24HR DINING ROOM) So you're forced to drive through. I didnt expect much but whatever....",0
The hours say they are open at 5:00am but it's 5:30 and the doors are  locked. I have been waiting for half an hour and still not open only drive thru I don't have a car so thats not helpful.,0
"The food is good and the children's recreation area is very good but there is no supervision of any Mc Donald's staff to ensure that the play space is respected for children under 3 years of age. Big kids get into their space, push them, step over them and step on their parents do nothing or Mc Donald's. I never back with my kids",0
"An abysmal excuse of a restaraunt, this location is a McDonalds only in name. With a wait time of 10-15 minutes at best for even the simplest order this location completely and utterly fails in its purpose as a fast food location. I strongly recommend any reader to take their time and money to ANY other location.",0
"I퐉 assuming this is the McDonald on celebrations so that I write this review under the correct McDonald on Celebrations...Manager name with a J I think it Jasmine or Judy I think it Judy but young lady was not professional(she is blonde and worked around 11pm 08/04/18).. I ordered my food in drive through when I got it the food was not good the meat was burnt, the bun was hard , the sandwich basically looked really old.. I came in told her the situation not once did she apologize for the horrible sandwich... I had to ask for a new sandwich to be made instead of her even suggesting it...she took the sandwich food preparation ..horrible food poor management needs to do better !!! Took my money and went else where..this McDonald will no longer be geting my service ",0
Went inside...nobody even acknowledged us. After 10 minutes we went through the drive thru and got our food only to get the bag with all of our fries put in upside down. Real nice.,0
Service slow. Manager was rude to everyone including girl on register. All 20 nuggets were cold along with the fries. When they didnt give me sauce rhe manager told me to wait even longer for her to get them.,0
"For kids its probably nice but adults running through or driving through for a quick bite you have to basically explain what you want on your burger. Ordered 2 mcdoubles with cheese and 2 small fries and they were so dry they were kinda crunchy without cheese or even fully cooked. Had to trim off parts that were either undercooked or too hard to eat. And with burger being so dry its almost like you need a medium drink to even eat the burger, and sadly I started with the fries. And to top it all off after using a card in the drive through i never got a receipt. Never going back. Would rather go to checkers across the street.",0
Google says 24hrs drove up before midnight and lights were shut up. Multi billion dollar company but can't update Google hours or train their employees to speak and communicate.,0
I am visiting Disney and staying in a hotel up the street. Have come here twice after leaving the park between 11-12:30. Each time I have waited in the drive through for over 15min just to place an order and then another 20min to pay/get the food. Only reason I don't leave is nothing else is open.,0
"The price is good using the McDonald's app with the dollar coke, what is the point of giving free French fries when they are cold. They were absolutely been trashed. Customer service was good this time.",0
Ordered mcdouble bundle no ketchup light onions and extra mustard I got cheese and pickles. The fries were terrible and my drink was fine.,0
"& then they complain they get paid min wage. I'm aware this is a fast food place, so I don't expect to be treated like royalty, but the service here is extremely slow. The staff have no customer service. Avoid this place, unless you are literally in love with waiting",0
The never has the coke icee.,0
I work at Ponderosa Steakhouse next door to this McDonalds. I have visited this location many times. When there is no business and its slow the workers just stand around talking like nothing going on. I've tried to place my order many times in hopes that I'd receive my food fast enough to get my food and head to work next door before I have to clock in and start my shift. The management is slow and doesn't help out as I figured they wouldn't. My mother went here as well after dropping my off at work to only experience this as well. Many people have to wait foreverrrrr just to get a simple order. The last time I went I just ordered an ice coffee French vanilla and instead of handing me the ice coffee they placed it besides a counter and made me wait 12 minutes for it. I didn't ask anyone this time because im just feed up with this location. If you want McDonalds DO NOT! and I repeat DO NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION!!! They care more about drivethrew then there customers eating inside or taking it to go!!!!!! I'd rare this place 0 if I could.,0
Was given completely the wrong order after having to wait more then 10 minutes for what should have just been 2 burgers and fries. Called repeatedly to explain the error and got a busy tone every time.,0
"This is by far the worst McDonald EVER! The lobby was completely packed with people and they had one person on front line, they also made the food too early so by time the customers got their food it was cold and the employees were singing and goofing around and not doing their job, and it was very unprofessional! Finally the McDonald were short handed and the drive thru line was big, and they were extremely slow and it took them 20 mi",0
"Very bad service. Theirs always a problem, to many workers not enough service. Too much hanging out like if their high school kids,  and they always have you wait in the parking lot for something,  and when it arrives they still forget something.",0
Slow as he'll and on top of everything I was missing food. After all the waiting. Never responded,0
The worst McDonalds ever! After standing in a backed up line with one guy running the register who had no clue! A manager finally steps up to help and still the line remainder ridiculous! I started watching people just walkout because of the wait. This McDonalds is in a prime location and you would think they would be better prepared. Chick-fil-A is a block down the street and has a smaller parking lot and they never have the problem this McDonalds does.,0
"The worst mcdonalds in any country I have visited. Food is ok, but the service was awful! There were more people queuing to complain than there were people sat in the restaurant. Staff were slow and not interested. Took over ten minutes just to serve some fries!",0
"Terrible service. Manager laughed in my face when I told them I was not satisfied with my food and service. I ordered the big breakfast without hotcakes. The eggs were old and half the portion that I normally get at any other location, the soda was flat, the coffee was cold and the staff is rude. This place should be shut down. Absolutely the worst McDonalds I've ever been to in my life.",0
Worst experience ever long wait. Then when I got to window waited again. Till I literally had to ask WHY AM I STILL WAITING FOR MY FOOD. as bags were sitting right in front of me.. Total wait time at this McDonald's was like 20 mins. RIDICULOUS..,0
Sitting in line at drive thru for 30 minutes.  Inside closed for whatever reason.  If your drive thru has a 30 min wait then why would walk up be closed? The owner of this place is an idiot.,0
"Drive thru was closed today. 10/9 at 3:45am. Is it still 24 hours if the drive thru is closed and the dining room as well? Park your car and wait, or drive 7 min down the road to the next one....oh the options.",0
They forgot about me in the drive-thru after asking me to pull to the third window. If I could leave 0 stars I would. Finally went into the store to see my bag sitting on the counter for so long it needed to be remade.,0
"In a pinch, it's food. My burger was slipped all over the inside of the wrapper and floating in grease. I just ate the dry parts. My husband's chicken sandwich came without any of the toppings and completely drenched in mystery dressing. Fries were super old and had that old grease fishy taste. Sodas (coke and Dr Pepper) were next to flat.

We were starving after a long hot day so, we just ate it and tried not to think about it.",0
"The Service is bad in special the drivetrue they never give the food correct and management are worse that the bad service that people receive they do not know the meaning of customer service. That McDonald's need to change does managers or give them a good training in customer service, courtesy and Ethical!",0
I waited 10 minutes in 106F to be told I can only place two orders instead 3 in the drive through. It's 2016 and I'm only able to get blue Powerade instea,0
"I used my McDonalds app and got some crazy discounts... but I'm still unsatisfied. The food is sad and old. Mr. Happy at the Expo looked like his life was over and didnt know anything about customer service.  The iced coffee was basically milk and creamer minus the coffee. I know this is fast food but damn, you guys didnt even try today.",0
"Slowest, most under staffed McDonald's I have ever been, everyone honking on the drive trun, people screaming they have been waiting forever, very stressful environment.",0
"Manages to allow something to screw up anything Everytime! I came here for 6 days in total. Normally I do not eat at McDonald's but this place is very close to where I'm staying.

They have new electronic ordering system using touchpad on giant vertical screen. Still gets my order wrong 80 percent of time... What? Asks me what drink I want. Then I just get the cup so why ask me? One day, I leave the locator number on table while I go bathroom. Locator and food is gone. Takes me a while to get it sorted out.forgets my drink {again)

One sauce dispensor just explodes pop knocks the container out of my hand under strong pressure. Gets little sauce on my clothes, not too bad but Jesus Christ... One night, lot of drinks do not work except for coke (yuk)  few other things not worth mentioning. They get swamped a lot nad hardly can keep up.

Otherwise place is relatively new looking as well as private bathroom with your own stall and sink. Clean.",0
Very disappointed that there was no indoor seating. Doors were locked. Drive-thru only. Needed to sit at a table and eat. Decided to eat elsewhere.,0
I ordered off the screen. It said take number and they will bring it to the table. Well the manager got my order together and got it totally wrong and then stood up there call the number and made me come get it. Did not receive any of my drinks. Went back up there a day the manager was not nice at all. Will not visit again.,0
"Jenny or wherever name you have my dear, pls listen to your customer. God bless your heart ",0
"Ordered the new strawberry sundae, too expensive. Tasted like strawberry jelly was used, too sweet and thick. Just order the regular sundae you get the same amount of ice cream. Took way too long to get my sundae.",0
Went here to get food got the completely wrong Order in the bag. And the workers want to make 15$+ an hr. How about do your job correctly first.,0
"So. When me and my family were getting McDonald's. when I ordered a bacon mcdouble with ketchup only, when I opened up my burger, it had pickles and onions on it when I didn't want!!!! I was waiting in the car for 10 minutes for my food. Not coming here again. I'll go to a different McDonald's from now on!!",0
Showed up here order than quarter pound of wwith cheese meal large and a given order to other people and I'm still waiting on it I wouldn't come here,0
"Priscila the 3rd shift supervisor\manager on duty does not care about costumer. I퐉 regular in this McDonalds and usually go on second shift and they are great! But Priscila was not wearing a name tag so I had to ask her for her name, Treat me like nothing. She really needs to work on her costumer service or go to anger ma",0
"Had a crispy chicken sandwich which was ok, small case and fries which resembled a form of spaghetti. I should of gone to Chick-fil-A.",0
36 mins to get food and got told it's because we had a large order.   Service was super slow.  People waiting 30-45 mins for food is ridiculous. Oh and by large order it was 4 Happy meals and a couple 2 for 3.  Ugh very disappointed,0
"Waste of time. Run. Do not go there. You have been warned. They will waste your time, and mess your order up, three times in a row.... Amazing. Zero Stars is my answer but I had to at least click on one to get pass this part.",0
Horrible I ordered two mcDoubles plain pickles only and on attempt #1 I received two with everything on #2 I received a mcDouble pickles only and a single patty hamburger.attempt #3 I took the hamburger back and received a double hamburger.. So I asked for a refund..which I received.. But what really shocked me was the attitude I received for trying to have my order corrected. Bad business,0
They did not put my two big breakfast meals into the bag when I was in the drive through.   I called them many times and not even get a person to pick up the phone.,0
Legit the worst McDonald's ever .have the app can't ever finish my purchase day or night cause guess what they aren't taking app orders .. then Everytime I go it's cash only who the hell carries cash anymore ..this is my Fourth attempt I ma over it the only reason I am even going cause it's open late,0
"I visited this establishment as the kfc over the road was a let down like no other.
Only pro here was that I got what I actually ordered however what a game trying to order it.
The lady was not listening at all and just started adding anything and everything to my order.
She was ruder then my explicit Eminem album and when I finally got to sorting out my order it was awful.. My chicken nuggets tasted like chewing on the chickens feet fresh out of the pen.
My Apple pie was questionable to if it was even a pie or not.
They only gave me bbq sauces, like who doesn't want ketchup ???
The best thing about the meal was driving out of the establishment never to look back again.

2 start because it was better then kfc.",0
The manager Cassandra is very rude to customers and very unprofessional they did not acknowledge people standing at the register and then I asked if they were taking orders they reply with that's why the kiosks are there two customers walked. I work for Uber Eats as a driver picking up food and then I experience very unpleasant,0
Ridicules they still have the dining room closed. Even for take out . Not everyone can go through the drive through due to a truck and trailer .,0
"They forgot to put in the toy, milk and plum sauce in our kids happy meal and forgot the salad dressing for our meal. Never have I seen such a terrible Mc Donalds in my life. I have been in them all over the  world with constant quality till now",0
"Went to eat at 3:40 am.  And the guy tells me that there's only mc chicken sandwiches. And that's all.  And if I wanted breakfast, I'd have to wait till 4 am.  Ridiculous.",0
3 trips here for a collective total of 45 minutes spent... They can't figure out the two lane ordering system... This is not FAST food by any stretch of the imagination... McDonald's are everywhere... Find a different one.,0
I was robbed.  I was charged on my bank card. and i was again charged cash.   I paid twice.  and got no refund.  all I got back. was a threat and an attitude.  no cash back,0
"Employees in the drive thru were rude, they forgot to put napkins and straws in the bag, and when they brought the order to us in the parking spot they thrust it at my husband with a ""here"" and walked off. Very rude.",0
Worst service a cash only McDonald lmao (to be fair it 3am) anyway went through drive thru twice first in both lines and still didn,0
"Yes the area Mc Donalds is known to be busy, but they  had me pull forward and I waited for 2 teas for 20 minutes, after already waiting 10 to get thru the drive thru ,no apologies at all, the first set of ice teas where sour to the taste ugh",0
"Didn't get anything to eat this time,  because they CLOSE THE LOBBY AT 10PM!!! Didn't go through the drive-thru cause I'm on a motorcycle. What kind of dingus closes half their store to customers in Old Town??",0
They were stink add no manners at the counter and took forever would not suggest anyone going Starbucks treat you better and it's down the road much faster,0
Not very helpful staff there machines for  orders doesn't work so good and they don't want to help people order,0
Just avoid this McDonald's at all cost. Staff is rude! Food is cold. Just not worth it. Go to the one in celebration trust me!,0
"We waited 15 minutes for our food, then when we recieved our food, the fries were cold. The fish sandwich tasted like it was microwaved and the new chicken sandwich tasted like rubber",0
Everytime I DoorDash I night they say they,0
"Horrible experience, hungry after a long day at Disney, we stopped in for a late dinner.took forever to take our order and even longer to get our order. definitely felt unwanted",0
"Food cold and forgot items, food was replaced so only 2 star I'm afraid",0
"My son got a vanilla milkshake it looked soupy and he tasted it and he said it had a off taste to it I told him throw it away, in a few minutes he was sick to his tummy . So beware .",0
"DOOR IS LOCKED EVERY SINGLE DAY!
HIGLY RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL!
LETTECE IS SPOILED ALWAYS!
DO NOT RECOMMEND ANY MC DONALD'S IN KISSIMMEE!",0
"SLOWEST McDonald's I have EVER been too... secind time in 3 days coming here, first time was about 25 in druve thru, before ordering.. now been sitting here 15 mins, haven't even ordered yet.. long line but i have been in longer and taken care of...",0
Ridiculous staff was lazy rude and slow bathroom was disgusting I did not eat there and I was hungry so I just left,0
"The trash cans were overflowing, there were multiple spills on the ground that weren't bothered to clean, and every table was dirty. Food took 27 minutes and when it finally came it was cold. Never again",0
Sat in drive thru for 30 minutes. Food was cold. Manager extremely rude. Go elsewhere. This location is horrible.,0
"I ordered a caramel frappe with no whip cream. Upon getting my Carmel frappe there was whip cream. They were upset when I requested they fix my order to meet the way I ordered. When they handed it back to my husband, they had scooped out the whip cream and another quarter of the frappe. Very rude about it as well.",0
EVERY TIME THEY FORGET SOMETHING. And i mean everytime. I have heard conversations about general nonsense take priority over customers while waiting. The employees generally juat dont seem to care with the exception of a few,0
Stopped on my way to work at 6:15 in the morning drive thru full only about 5 people in the inside line . Waited bout 8 minutes no one took my order . Slow service and everyone speaking Spanish.  Walked out no food,0
Employees hardly speak english. I don have 20 minutes to waste because the workers can,0
They need better customer service. The people in the drive thru are so rude that I almost came out my professional skin. Get it together McDonalds. #192 McDonalds close to go cart place,0
They forgot 3sandwiches after they pulled me up n the food was not hot,0
We really can't understand how hard it can be to complete our order. Every single time we go they make multiple mistakes n it's so frustrating.,0
the Worst ?4 hours?McDonald I,0
Dosent stand behind promotion at ordering menu says if they dint mention the 2 for 1$ apple pies at the end of ur order u get one free lies they never mentioned it and i still had to pay for my pies beware!!,0
Horrendous service...was on drive thru for 10 minites...didnt move...went inside...took 15 minutes for 2 shakes and a fry...order was wrong...was ignored when i told them order was wrong..pretty hard to offend this new york guy...worst McDonald's i have ever been in!!,0
Disappointed - claimed Egg Mc muffin deal was over and charged outlandish price! Service not great - wrong coffee received after ordering DECAF and NO cream given...,0
"It was terrible, took forever. Only giving 2 stars because the McMuffin was good.",0
I've never been to such a horrible restaurant like this. It took over 1 hour to get fries and a McFlurry. Stay as far away as you can from this McDonald's. Nasty dirty facility too.,0
I didn't get much sugar for my coffee all milk and day getting served my Burger not my Burger my sausage mcmuffin didn't give it to me in the morning They got me for some money not a pleasant place to go when you hungry you want your food,0
Horrifically slow even when nobody is in line. The worst Mcdonalds I've been to speed wise. We gave it three tries and it was slow each time.,0
Never once have I gotten my coffee done right. Cream in sugar out. I got 35 cream in my bag. It was 8 cream in. I got no sugar. Crazy,0
Took 10 minutes to take my cash for order.then another 20 minutes to get my food.which was missing the drink for the happy meal. Not good,0
"Terrible service, I think hands down worst mcdonalds I have ever been too. Manager wouldn't even come over to help. Absolute joke of a mcdonalds. Go 1 mile down either way and you will be much happier.",0
"Not to thrilled with this one anymore,  used to love it when it was the world biggest McDonalds. Now it's like the others except for a few items on the menu.  Plus they got rid of the life size Ronald McDonald.",0
Because we had a big order they kept giving our food to other people who had smaller orders. People who ordered after us had already eaten and left by the time we got our food.,0
"I waited in the drive thru line for half an hour, ordered my food, and not until I got to the window did they tell me they were taking cash only, at 11pm on a saturday? And when I asked to talk to the manager on duty they were no where to be found, mever returning to this location and would urge anyone thinking of it to stear clear from this horrible McDonalds",0
Burger was greasy and the fries tasted like the oil needed changed,0
Super slow...we waited an extremely long time in the drive through.  People behind us were beeping and honking because no one was taking orders in one drive thru lane.,0
This place sucks beyond belief. Staying in a hotel next door have a semi for my wheels. Knocked on the door ask the manager if I could order a shake and get it at the door. I'm sure you can guess the answer,0
The worst place do even be doing uber the manager makes uber drivers wait and dont even put order thru tell u get there please speed up for me to keep doing uber here and i hope the gm sees this maybe she will make u speed up judith,0
"Super long drive thru lines , I suggest u go in the lobby n place order electronically for faster service ",0
Waited in drive thru for 20 minutes had to go in to get our order.manager was great but they had everyones order messed up.,0
"Food it's okay, however the customer service is terrible. The few times I visited here the staff was rude, and unprofessional.",0
Worst prices hair in food stay away no self serve drink station,0
"By far the worst McDonald's that I have ever been to. The entire experience was bad, time consuming, and they didn't even get my food right.",0
If I could give a zero star I would. This place took 5 minutes to even greet me at the window. I ended up driving away with no food. Don't waste your time here.,0
"The wait is 30 minutes, my nuggets where white in the center because they didn't separated them before putting in the fryer, all McDonalds that I visited near my hotel on kisseme took 30 minutes.",0
"Good food but ,staff so bad, every one  even the manager",0
One of the worst McDonald's in the nation. The food is usually stale or cold and is always made sloppily. When you complain they act like you are at fault for the bad sandwich.,0
No free refills. What a drag.,0
Too long waiting lines to get a very bad customer service. Food is ok.,0
"Having kiosks, instead of human cashier, really a bad idea not fan of it. Taking my business to a different place were greetings,  and thank you is the most important thing!!",0
Like all the other McDonald's they're expensive underpaid understaffed and they close too early but that's because they're understaffed,0
Very rude customer service. Go somewhere else,0
"HORRIBLE I WENT HERE FOR AN UBER PICK UP AND IF YOU DROVE UBER BEFORE YOU CAN PICKUP THRU THE DRIVE THRU AND WHEN I TOLD THEM THAT SHE SAID ""WE ARE REALLY BUSY RIGHT NOW SO YOU HAVE TO COME IN OR ITS UP TO YOU"" WHEN I WENT IN I WAS EXPECTING A LING LINE. BUT INSTEAD THERE WAS ONLY 1 PERSON INFRONT OF ME. NOT BUSY AT ALL. THIS WAS HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. MCDONALD'S NEVER LETS ME DOWN SMH.",0
Over 1 hour to go through the drive thru.  Only 20 cars.  Absolutely a mess.,0
They had someone who dont know how to take order and and everything was dry nasty and the coffee plus the manager was there smh,0
Waited almost 20 minutes for an order. There were only 5 cars in drive thru and about 7 people inside.  Finally I canceled and went to a sit down restaurant where I got served within 10 minutes.,0
False advertising. Drive through is open 24 hours. Diner closes at 10!,0
"It's a messy please, the costumer service is very nasty they don't even pay attention to the time that people are waiting in line. I'm not going to gave them any Stars.",0
Food was very good but quite a lot was missing from the order when we got home.,0
"Incredible slow, lines are out of control, understaffed.",0
Total order mess up and the person taking my order hated his job. The only reason I know is because he told me.,0
Let's put it this way.....you better check your bag of food before leave. They can barely understand English let alone get your order right. ,0
Food is always wrong,0
The service was terrible. They got my order wrong twice and they didn't have me my fries with my food. And the first time they miss something in my order....,0
Worse McDonald's I've ever been to. Twice I've been there and both times I had to sit there and wait almost 15 mins to get my food. The second time the staff was there in the kitchen taking pictures while my food was getting cold. Never again,0
WORST McDonald EVER!!!  Awful em,0
We waited in the drive thru for 30 minutes. It was late after visiting the parks all day and they were close to our hotel. I would stay clear of this disaster of a restaurant.,0
Slowest McDonald's I've ever visited.  Checked in on a pickup order for Uber.  Waited 15 minutes and they were so backed up that they hadn't even started on the order yet.  Will not be returning to this location.,0
the service was horrible I was very very disappointed they don't give you the right food that don't take that order correctly then-manager I don't know why they do on their time because you ask for manager and takes forever to come and assist you I will never go there again,0
Building is completely locked so can't use bathroom even after waiting for curbside.,0
Cash only drive through after waiting 30 minutes,0
"They can not get any order right. My order took 3 remakes and finally I had to go in to the restaurant, after placing my original order in the drive thru!",0
A drive through line around the building and into the shopping center parking lot that barely moved for 20 minutes made me drive off without ordering.,0
I dont understand because mc Donald is a fast food place and I go thru the drive thru and  the tell me that I have to wait in one of the parking spots in stead of grab and like any normal fast food.,0
The buttermilk crispy tenders are not crispy nor tender the meat is horrible the worst I've ever had why would I eat here when I can get some decent fries chicken and burgers at Culver's or some f the best fast food chicken from chik full ,0
Hands down the slowest service I have EVER seen at ANY fast food restaurant.,0
Drive threw took forever we waited 40 minutes to find out there ice cream machine was down drive threw cashier was very rude and uncaring,0
Slow service got orders wrong but still kept people waiting while rest of their food went cold worst mc donalds I've been to for service,0
"If you need food late at night after work (2-3 am), don't count on this place because they take at MINIMUM 20-30 mins to send you through the drive thru.",0
If the app says you can dine in there than you should be able to dine inside,0
"Usally the location I visit is on the money both with over allservice and cleanses, how ever this particular day the place was a total mess and service was horrible when it should not have been because it wasn't busy.",0
"Worse c/s ever! Unreal, people just DON'T want to work. This team bust gave up!",0
Ordered 2 double fish fillet sandwiches and got 1 double and 1 single. Order must be checked and double checked for Togo. I'm not coming back to change the order after few miles.,0
"Service sucks, how are you 24/7 and randomly close 2-6?? Waste of time",0
They messed up the order after explaining a few times of what we wanted and had hair in both of my egg McMuffins,0
"Horrible bad service waited too long at the  drive through, missing everything in my order",0
"The good thing is that is open 24. They do not have enough personnel. Food was just okay, help us survive till the next morning.",0
Standard food. Fast service. Cash only at night. More expensive than other McDs.,0
Manager doesn't know how to put his name tag on right side up. How can he run a restaurant?,0
"Tried 3 of the kiosk to order my food. Never completed an order on a kiosk, something different wasn't available on each one. Busy as hell, took a long time to get my food. Never again",0
Increible how the drivethru work here waiting the outside line more than 5 mins and see how the inside lo e pass 7 cars already... unacceptable,0
My son got a vanilla shake there it didn't look right it was soupy he tasted it and his stomach was upset all that day,0
Bad experience taking too long with the orders.,0
Took 29 minutes in the drive thru for 2 McDoubles and a happy meal. At 7pm.,0
"It was a crappy McDonald's. They lie about their hours I went around 9:30 for food and they were ""closed""! When they clearly say that they are 24hours. Don't waste your time with this place! Worst McDonald's ever",0
Tortillas stale and why ask if I want sauce if you aren't going to give any? Lol,0
Gave order in the drive thru lady wasn't paying attention on what I wanted mind you I only ordered 3 things had to repeat myself 3 more times at the window then they still get my order wrong never again,0
If I could give it zero stars I would we went here 3 times recently and they mess up every time and they are just rude people I would recommend staying away from this location there's a checkers across the street I would recommend over them,0
Terrible service. Left the drive thru after barely moving for 10 minutes. Not prepared for late night customers.,0
Slow service. And we were the only ones in there  Found hair in my food. If I could give no stars I would never comming back,0
Terrible..An Employee name Andrea has the worse Customer service ever. My order was wrong and they still was giving me a hard time to fix it..BAD SERVICE,0
"Me and my family were there at 10:15 pm on a Sunday and they would not let us in.we were not happy at all,wat to soon to be locking doors.",0
The only thing worse than the service was the food. My wife's Big Mac tasted like it had been dropped in an ashtray.,0
"Very dirty.  Cold food.  Somebody peed in the play area.  Management was informed, but nobody cleaned it up.",0
This is my third time visiting this store horrible place to eat all the 3 person at the service desk did not even eye contact with me and after food ready they just damp my order on the desk and I had to asked one gentleman if that was my order then he said  yes horrible place will not recommend it,0
"Ordered a regular big mac with large fries. They gave me the Bigmac Bacon, it was cold. Fries were cold.",0
"Curbside is a joke
Waited for 15 mins, should just go through the drive thru.",0
Always a long wait today it took 35 min in drive through most times around 15 min but like their ice tea so but up with it,0
Slow as molasses and still couldnt get it right. Dont go here after 12am. Had to go inside and get my $1 soda they forgot to give me.,0
"Waited more than 20 mins, trying to make order but they just keep saying"" be right with you"" to finally tell me they dont have what i wanted.",0
Watched a Manager Jennifer push and put her hands on an employee while she was handing my food out the window. Don't know why because the Order was 100% right. This is the way employees at McDonald's are treated?,0
Only gave me part of the food that I ordered them the manager gave me attitude they weren't remorseful for messing up my order at all,0
FOOD  WAS MEDIOCRE! The service slow and unfriendly.,0
The Drive Thru Was way too long there were 100 cars we we waiting 20 minutes to order. It's shorter ordering inside,0
Management just stands there while employees run around working,0
"Extremely slow service, one cashier with multiple people working slowly in the back, a line up to and out the door, and the drive through wrapped around the building. Avoid late at night.",0
The diner was dirty and so was all the tables and I dont want to mention the restrooms were smelly and dirty there was two teenagers on their cell phones wasting valuable Time,0
The lady at the drive-thru was extremely rood and they messed up my big Mac I was missing two cheeseburgers and my 10-piece nugget only had seven nuggets,0
"Dirty, unkind, too long waiting time, too high work load with minimum of employees",0
We퐎e always missing stuff from our order. About to start going to th,0
"Neg stars.

After waiting 30 minutes in drive threw, my hashbrown was literitly cold. And my bagel was soggy... worst breakfast ever ",0
Don't get the breakfast burritos they advertise a nice beautiful looking burrito on their menu and then when you get it it's a quarter of the size of which they advertise the price has gone up on these and the quality has gone way down they have false advertising on their menu,0
Worst McDonalds  I've ever been to. Waited over twenty minutes.  Burgers were almost  raw. Plus no toys in happy meals.,0
This is my second visit and it's even slower and longer than my first. Unbelievably long wait times in the drive through.,0
Long wait and 3manger on duty and one person line. Then to fine out no fish at certain time bk at all times,0
Waited on line for 45 mins just to place the order.,0
it prompted me to legitimately kill myself. so ridiculous. never have had towards long in my 35 years of life,0
The people working here are not friendly.  Went through the drive through and the only only thing said to me was my total.,0
Somehow they forgot to give us our order...no big deal I needed the exercise and they did apologize,0
"Food was cold.
Service could of been better",0
Slowest service ever! I haven't taste the food but i hope is not bad!,0
Waited 30 minutes in drive thru line be told they are out of fish and chicken,0
"I was there to separate times one time I paid over $2 more than the second
time and got the exact same thing",0
Messed up our order something terrible and then asked us to pay extra for the mess they made took forever in line slow slow people,0
McDonald's is the worst the foods always cold and they recook old food when you ask for it hot but the frappes are the bomb that's why they got a star.,0
Slow and the people behind me got their food first. Common problem here. I just order a drink and burger.,0
"Waited 60 minutes in a drive thru, the line wasnt even that big. The lines at the theme parks are better",0
Not only was the speed of service poor I waited in line for just under 20 mins to receive my food thrown inside of a bag. I did not eat either the 1/4 pounder or the nuggets. They really need to shut this restaurant down because for the love of god they don't hire decent staff this has been going on for years I'm not eating food with strands of hair or food that's hanging out of a bag such ill preparation,0
"Had a weird, terrible, unusual experience ,Went tonight, about 8:20pm. Only 2 cars in front of me. Ordered using my mobile app (which I love it!) Ordered a mc chicken, and guess what?!! It came with NO CHICkEN!! And enough mayo to make two more. Enjoy the picture!!",0
Attention owner: do you even care??? Worst drive-through in all of Florida. S L O W!! Fire everyone including your manager you got the 3 stooges working in there! It is NEVER okay to sit in a drive thru for 20 minutes. Get it together or close your doors!,0
"Can't change mobile order once placed. I wanted light chocolate in my coffee instead of 6 obese size pumps that drowns the actual taste of coffee and makes it taste extremely sweet. Asked at speaker, window 1, window 2 and the person that made it. Can't do it. And they forgot the hot sauce to my burrito. But this is McDonald's standard.",0
"constantly miss items. it baffles me. I work fast food. items pop up on a screen, you put them in the bag. its very simple. half the time they put ice in the drink when I ask for no ice, which again, a drink pops up on a screen, and underneath it will say ""no ice"". I'm not really sure if yall just don't care or if this is really that hard.",0
"This is the second time I've came to this McDonald's and they are closed. How you 24 hours but closed. They very rude. Last time they told me they open at 7am in the drive thru, then this morning I was told 6:30am. I come to this one because it's so close to my house. But it seems I'm going have to find another one. This McDonald's need a manager and someone who can be in charge and know how to handle a restaurant. When I come to this McDonald's I always spend $40 or better. Get y'all stuff together",0
"Says 24/7. Mobile app allows for drive through order. Lights are all on and drive through speaker is active. But nobody is working. Location is closed, no sign, no disabling online orders, nothing.",0
"Repeatedly missing items. Repeatedly ignoring allergy restrictions such as simple specifics on orders like no onion, no cheese, etc. overnight is horrible. Overnight Manager identified herself as  crystal on 3/5/23 was not helpful and in better terms, an incompetent woman.",0
I was light headed. I figured let me stop at this McDonald's seeing that its on my way home and close by. I was surprised the shake machine was up and running. I ordered large fries and a Strawberry milkshake. I paid to much money for a little nit of food. My fries had way too much salt on them. Because they mixed fresh fries with fries that wrre sitting out basically old kinda stale. The milkshake had vanilla at the bottom with Strawberry on top. But that nits what kinda upset me it was the size of the shake. I was asked what size I wanted. Of course I was confused. I guess all McDonald's are not the same. I said small. But the cup I received was a cup size you order off the dollar menu. And I was charged like 5 bucks for it. Smh. Never again. I thought shake size was only small or large.  Not a baby cup size.,0
"The amount of times I come to this location, and the ystem is down?is embarrassing.  I work in food, I know when people don",0
"They need more happy people in there and people to actually Acknowledge there guest and smile.  It's horrible to feel like your a bother as a customer when your spending your hard earned working money at your restaurant.  NOT GOOD for the business at all, especially when your a regular.  This needs attention Immediately to earn the people's business.",0
"I hate this McDonald's in the morning. The drive through workers are undertrained and snappy ( there is a difference between a sausage egg mcmuffin and a sausage mcmuffin) I was overcharged the manager (Tim) had me pull up for whatever reason ( I assumed for my overcharge) and never came out the door, I go in after 15 minutes and he acts unresponsive to the guy calling his name( that's how I know what it is) very unprofessional and I will be reaching out to their corporate headquarters about this matter",0
This isn the first time it happens but it definitely the one that bothered me the most. Went for lunch did a mobile order to make  it quick and spent 20 minutes of my 30 minute lunch waiting for my food. Had to walk in and ask for it. No napkins or st,0

"Went is using a mobile code and the lady at the register had not clue what she was doing , so I asked for a manager and she told me she was the manager . So I tryed to help her out telling her my code was for a 5$ meal and I would like to add a 4 piece nuggets to that ! She told me the total was 12$ so in my head I퐉 like no way a 4 piece is 6 $ so I told her that was incorrect and she instead it wasn , so she does Somthing on the computer I pay and still missing my extra nuggets after I told her 4 times I would like a extra",0
Horribly slow each of the last 2 times I've gone here.  Attempting to grab something quick for my kids or wife and just no such thing as fast food any longer.,0
Showed up at 440am they said we are closed till 5am. Waited till 5am and then they said 530am??? What is going on with the world. This is after coming from trying to order at the other McDonald,0
The employees in that place is soo terrible their very rude the lady told me to hold on I,0
Slowest drive thru ever. Takes over 30 minutes for anything!,0
"Not only does this location take forever to give you the wrong food, they also give you undercooked food. We had to wait over 10 minutes for our order and this chicken sandwich was still pink.",0
12.17 Late Saturday and No one is working at this McDonald's.  It's supposed to be 24 hours.  Poorly managed like most McDonald's.  GM should be canned.,0
I have never seen such a slow mc donasl in my life.,0
"Very slow customer service, 2nd day in a row that they are out of orange juice. Not up to standards",0
"Seriously this place is gone to the dogs. Imagine sitting in line at a fast food restaurant for over 25 minutes to get a burger and fries. Only to receive said Burger and half of the large fry you ordered. Cold limp fries inside of a large container which could have easily fit in a medium container. I'm so sick of these restaurants. Fast food is no longer fast food, the service is subpar, and the food is not even as advertised. I'm literally getting jipped on my food while also waiting for almost 30 minutes to get it.",0
"I'm not one to just say only something negative but for the life of me I can't find anything positive. This branch is the slowest I have ever been to . It never gets my order right , no matter how simple I made it. The burger's condiments were all wrong . The fry's were old as hell and the unsweet tea tasted old and sour.  Definitely no going there again no matter how desperate.",0
"I never ever go here because it's the most incompetent McDonald's I've ever seen operate. I ran the drive thru in NYC when I was 17 so I know a thing or two about the process and how it's really not rocket science but somehow they can't ever get it right. Unfortunately for me my husband picked up dinner for me from there and I very Unfortunately didn't specify which one to go to... although this one is closest to home I will drive all the way to Altamonte to avoid it, and the way gas prices are that should tell you all you all need to know. Tonight it was missing fries (we ordered a total of 6 whole items so I can see how that was overwhelming to this bunch) and freezing cold fries which I have no idea how you can even do since even if it been under the warmer for a while... stone cold fries? I wouldn't put it past them they kept them on a counter somewhere instead though. And on top of that I made the mistake of asking for extra pickles on my big mac which I'm sure put this kitchen in a frenzy so they just threw all the ingredients in the box so I can do my own assembling of it... which was probably for the best because who knows what chaos it would cause for them to assemble it. I would be embarrassed to own this place. Don't go here... I know it's fast food and we shouldn't expect much but Altamonte Mcds never dissapoints. Trust me it's worth the drive.",0
Cold fries. Double cheeseburgers were not hot and the cheese wasn't melted.  The m&ms were dumped on the top of the mcflurry and some spilt out.  $18 is expensive for my meal and a happy meal for my daughter. Then subpar at best.,0
Bad service that don't give me what you order,0
"Very unsatisfied, order was wrong. Management correct my order. Just gave me an extra fry and dismissed me. Will not be returning. My money is just as good at burger King. I understand that you are short-handed, but that should never compromise customer service.",0
yall need to step it work I know its stressful but ppl at the window need to look in the bag know its the right thing and repeat it back . I'm happy I don't work there nor do I ever want to if I had to but everytime our order is wrong . and you pay for not what you get its sad we can't afford to pay for sonthing we want. and get ripped off. let's do better guys. if you don't like ur job or have an additide towards ppl just leave it at home or find another job .,0
"Today visit was the worse . Other stops they forgot things or wrong in my orders, forgetting hashbrowns , wrong  items drinks made wrong. But today it took the cake, The work took a couple of minutes to take are order . Then when we got are order my wife check it, all the items where there . But only 2 ideam that where right was the hash browns and a sweet tea . Order a #3  Bacon egg and cheese biscuit or hash Browns and sweet tea 2nd order was a sausage egg mcmuffin with a hot chocolate. We got a sausage muffin with cheese and a sausage muffin with a hot chocolate that my wife said it was not drinkable . If you ask why didnt we take it back . We dont have time drop the wife off at work then i get on the road to go to work . Dont think we be going back to this McDonald's its becoming more of a disappointment then a enjoyment.",0
I felt really sick after eating the fish fillet sandwich. They made me wait a long time at curbside for my sandwich and fries. I assumed it will all be fresh. How wrong was I. Disgusting sandwich and stale fries. Never returning to this location again.,0
"I ordered a kid's meal that took 14 minutes to receive,  they claim hash browns are not a lunch time item even though it's on the all day breakfast menu claiming it took 12 minutes to cook a hash brown worst location ever",0
"I came here at around 11pm last night, I ordered a spicy mcchicken medium meal, 2 cheeseburgers, and I asked for the fries fresh. I usually never have an issue when I go to other McDonald's. I order the same thing. Well its not fresh, its called ""to order"". I had to wait , no issues with that, if you want fresh food you typically have to wait for it to be made.  I got my food 8 minutes later and drove off so I could get the food to the house. Almost home, I look in the bag and grab a fry, because mcdonalds fries fresh are freaking delicious. Yeah no, I bit 5 fries all at once and they were soggy and unsalted. Highly disappointed. I tried to call and the phone just rang. I was no longer close to the mcdonalds so I just ordered the same thing at another mcdonalds closer to my destination in winter park. They actually gave me a discount and apologized for my troubles at this mcdonalds. They said they ""understood"". I wont be coming back to this mcdonalds.",0
The worst place to eat. Go there only if you have 3 hours of leisure time & you dont mind waiting 45 minutes to an hr to be taken care of. Only one manager & too many rookies are uncapable too supply the high demand.,0
Terrible service. Charged me $7.98 for 2 snack size McFlurries when that is the price for 2 regular size. Asked for a meal and only gave me the burger. Full of dumb people that can,0
"Worst McDonald's in the area. After waiting in line over 20 minutes I finally get to the window, for them to inform me that they were closed. Mind you this was at 1:12 am Saturday morning. The store hours for this location reads closes at 3 a.m not 1:12 a.m!! Clearly management didn't want to serve any more customers due to high volume not because they were closed or closing. Will never go back to this location.",0
"I live close so I frequent this location. They almost always get my very simple order wrong and they can't even use the most basic forms of respect such as speaking to a customer. They just take the card, hand it back(most of the times without the receipt) and at the next window hand you your incorrect order without so much as a word. Head a few miles down A1A and get much better service with a friendlier staff.",0
"The last in a string of bad experiences, I only received half my order and it was still wrong. Genuinely impressive how almost every experience at this location is terrible. Won't be returning",0
"This has been one of the worst McDonald's I have been too. Not only where the to drive through lines extremely long, but then when we get to the window the person was confused with our order. We drive up to get our food and the person was pleasant enough. The food now left a lot to be desired. French fries were not fresh. They had zero salt. We ordered a 10 piece of chicken nuggets and got eight pieces. Then on top of that they're old and stale and cold. Needless to say we will never be going there again.",0
Miyra is extremely rude and slow. Acts like she hates her job. Took 30 minutes to get an egg McMuffin and hash brown,0
Horrible McDonald's I had visited this McDonald's in the late evening and I was getting cussed out by a employee mopping the floor. How would I supposed to know what area are you mopping without a sign? or just tell me politely to watch my step. I would've kept coming to this McDonald's but if someone is mopping the floor and cussing customers out for walking on the wet floor needs to be fired.,0
Strangely I almost always get skipped in line at this McD. I will pull up as the lone vehicle and another pulls up a minute later in the lane beside me and get immediate service. I am not sure if it's because my car is quiet or what but its mildly annoying. Never has my sauce order been correct. Never. Even when I pay for it. Even when I ask and confirm at the window. It's awkward confirming sauce and then having to ask for the exact sauce you were just promised was in the bag.,0
"Today at approximately 2:20 I asked for a happy meal and asked for the extra french fries in the order and the lady of the dri thru told me give it to me - give it to me now, in a high tone of voice give me the bag and I pack very reluctantly, she was really rude at the time of serving me simply for asking for some fries, now if you could give me a feedback, because it really is not the way to serve the customer",0
"Ok, so I went and tried the new Spicy chicken nuggets, I personally prefer the Wendy's spicy nuggets they are much more tender and fresh tasting. The McDonald's Spicy Nuggets were Spicy alone, add on the Spicy sauce and they will make you sweat!!! But mine were extremely dry and hard, one had a weird rubber chewy piece so that was interesting, I can say I tried them but I was not impressed.",0
"food is typically put together well, however curbside is a minimum of 20 minutes once you pull up. Then hopefully you can get a curbside spot because the spots are usually full of customers theyve had pull forward and park to wait for their food. might as well go through the drive thru",0
"i퐉 honestly only leaving one star because i have to. staff was rude as can be. i went through the drive thru and ordered a #9 the 2 cheeseburger meal and an extra cheeseburger with a small fry and at the window checked the food and the employee was rude asked if we got a problem and rolled her eyes. well the order was wrong so good thing i checked. went inside the store and finally got my cheeseburgers after standing there for 15 minutes and complained to the manager and she walked away with no response. Finally got my food and opened it up and there was A HAIR IN MY FOOD. the entire order was wrong the first time around. Never will i ever go back to this restaurant again.  terrible service, i just ended up going bac",0
They mess with your food here!!!,0
"I left in fear. I was treated so rude. Sat at drive through for 20 minutes.. Was yelled at walking up to window to ask why they are not taking my order. Did nothing wrong but was treated like a criminal. And then the comment. "" Don't worry, we will take special care of your order"" in that tone.  I WILL NEVER FEEL SAFE EATING AT MY MCDONALD'S AGAIN",0
"I am done with this Mcdonald's ! I have been going there almost every morning and get a double biscuit and gravy. How hard is it to get a order correct.They charge me for it but I don't get it. It seems when a certain crew is working i get the worst service or no service. I have been told they have no gravy, no biscuits best one of all at 4 am they do not service breakfast due to corona. But waffle house does..",0
"Unfortunately today while waiting in line (pulled to the side not in the drive through lane) my frappe was given to the person behind me. She graciously didn't take it and instead got off her car and walked back inside with it. I waited 10 mins and when nothing happened I went through the drivethrough line again and the girl at the window told me she was gonna give me that same drink back. I was very confused by this, especially in Covid times. I requested a different drink, no offense to the nice lady that brought it back but just to be safe. The worker said to me that the lady only touched the lid while carrying it so then I asked to change the lid to which they told me I had to pull forward and wait again. Needless to say it was not worth being late to work for this 占쏙",0
"If I could give it zero stars I would. Your MANAGER is RUDE. Someone ordered breakfast at 1050am, she said no more breakfast. I said ""there is no more breakfast?"" She said out loud, in front of customers ""ends at 1030, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT"" No everyone DOESNT know that, some serve it 24/7. She continued to berate me.",0
"The employees are great but the store manager is just a nightmare. We have coupons with the McDonald's app. The store manager stated that she really hoped that they would stop honoring them, because she was tired of having to ring then up. My wife and I went to the restaurant today and, she said the system was down and she would not accept them at all. I'm going to try and avoid this McDonald's in the near future.",0
"Super rude. Suppose to be 24 hrs and they acted like ""how dare i eat here"" at like 2am. The worker never even spoke to me just took my card and shut the door on me didn't even get a chance to ask for ketchup.",0
"They never ever give me the amount of cream and sugar I ask for in my coffee. The super lazy ones tell me their cream and sugar dispensers are broken at least one to two times a week :/ been visiting the one and extra mile away in Casselberry, just bc they make my coffee how I want. This location used to get a LOT of my hard earned dollars but as of late I been choosing other location.",0
"My order # was 1471. Simple order. Big breakfast with extra sausage
No utensils, no syrup, no extra sausage.
So I call. Nina said she was the manager. But transferred me to Bri. Told Bri what happened and she said she would talk to the crew. So I explained that does not help me. I still don have what I paid for. She asked how she could help. I asked her to hang on while I answered another phone. Instead she hung up. Few minutes later I called back. Now no one will answ",0
"Has to be THE most depressing McDonalds in the area. Ran by a bunch of immature, rude, and miserable workers. I go there because its the closest to me, but won't be going back.",0
"I bought some sundaes and I requested some napkins, but they refused to provide them to me. Too miserable for a multinational company. If they don't provide napkins, what can we expect for the food?",0
Slow af I don,0
DO NOT EAT HERE. Me and 2 friends work right near this McDonald's. We all have each gotten sick twice on completely different occasions each time we eat here. I'm pretty sure they cook these burgers on the floor.. Don't go here unless you like upset stomachs or puking.,0

"3rd visit in 3 weeks to the one  simeron in Apopka near hunt club , first time was slow service the second visit I was told at the drive thru they couldn't take anymore orders because the staff didn't show up but yet took orders in the other lane, and today's visit again super slow and after we left the drive thru realized the sweet tea was not sweet. I'm so done with this location!",0
Good morning good morning the coffee was old the place is dirty I will not come back here again the people are nice but the place is dirty very dirty please clean up paint please cleanest McDonald though the bathroom was dirty the tables were dirty the outside was dirty have a great day,0
"Worst McDonalds you can possibly find in Florida. If I could give 0 stars that would be more suitable.  They mess up orders they're the only McDonalds in 10 miles that charges extra after 2 pumps of sugar. They dont understand what ""light ice"" means and you're going to have problems if you are trying to use their app for coupons. Please do not allow this McDonalds to ruin your experience and take your money, any McDonalds within 5 miles of this location will provide you the proper service McDonalds is iconic for. Take it from a local, stay far away from this location unless you like waiting ridiculous wait times and feeling cheated out of your money. I have visited this location enough times to understand they are literally the worst location I have been to. This is coming from someone who has been all around central Florida. Please do yourself a favor and go to any other McDonalds to get the experience you deserve.",0
Cashier Jamesha mocking customers laughing in their face. Moving very slow. At her own beat. Very rude. If I were apart of the Wright family she would definitely not be apart of my family business. I was in drive thru for 25 minutes before parking and coming inside all to witness the foolery which has the line backed up in the first place. However Jamesha is the only one who had a name tag on. Everyone looked over worked and under paid. Very slow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also as I'm writing this review waiting my order it's been 35 minutes here total. The manager sets the tone and she is even slower. Her walk expresses she's lazy,0
"I've been going to this location most of my life since it's not far from my home. So I've seen this McDonald's go through a lot of changes. The employees here generally have decent attitudes, there are a few that tend to be rude. The store is also dirty a lot of the time. It's a very busy location, and maybe it's from having a lot of foot traffic, but the floor is usually dirty, the drink station will be filthy and wet and sticky, the ketchup area will be out of ketchup, and/or there will be ketchup all over the place, too. The tables tend to be dirty, too, you usually have to clean off your own table. Also they have those light up tables that kids like, and when I go in there with my kid there will be homeless people sitting there, and they won't be eating, and they'll have their stuff all over the place and sit there for hours. And mind you, these tables seat about 8 and there will be one homeless person sitting there. My kid will want to sit there so he can play with the lights, and I'll have to tell him he can't because this one homeless person sitting at one of the largest table, is camping there. The employees don't seem to care at all that these people are doing this despite them sitting there for hours, but buying anything. Sometimes they'll even be sleeping at the table.
The kid's play area is also really crappy. They have nothing for the kids to play on like a playplace. They have 4 of these really crappy touch screen games things that rarely work properly, or at all. When I was a kid they had a huge playplace, which they took out when they remodeled the store. It even had N64's at one point, along with the playplace. But they took it all out and replaced it with a ""sitting"" place instead of a playplace. It's really awful.
So, all in all, this McDonald's is dirty, has a lot of homeless people that practically live there, and isn't really kid friendly. The food is okay, as long as it's hot food (I get a lot of cold food or my order is wrong), and the employees are generally friendly, but there have been a lot of times where the managers are rather lackluster, meaning that you can tell they don't want to be there. This location needs a lot of work. And they need to do something about the amount of homeless people that hang around in there. There hasn't been a single time I've gone there that there wasn't at least one homeless person there taking up the interactive table that kids want to sit at, with all their dirty things sitting on the table itself. The table is by the front counter, too and you can often times smell the homeless person that's sitting there the whole time you're waiting in line and waiting for your food and while you get your drinks. It is not kid friendly at all at this store. With the store being in a nicer part of town you'd expect quite a bit more cleanliness.",0
"This location was awful today. They rang up our order wrong, then gave it to us still wrong. Took over 15 min to get our order and we had to ask for our drink cups so we could at least get our drinks while waiting. As we stood there, we saw almost every person have a problem with their orders. The person at the register was messing up every order and the back kept making the wrong things. Worst visit ever.",0
"Horrible service. Drive thru speaker was not lit up/broken and when I pulled up to order, I was greeted rudely. I asked if I could order at the window and the lady said ""i guess so."" My order was also wrong and the bacon burger came with no bacon. BAD place to visit during a 3rd shift!!",0
Worst McDonald,0
Get a veggie burger already!! God!!!,0
"No matter the time of day, this location always messes up my order, shorts me or makes me wait wayyyy toooo long.  Will not be going back to this location as I have given them way too many chances and for years nothing has change other then worse service.",0
"Two employees preparing the food simply didn't wear a mask. I am highly dissatisfied with the effort put into enforcing the wearing of a mask. Why during this pandemic, which has not settled in the least, have you not have had a keen eye on employees in order to safeguard the wellbeing of your customers. It's unacceptable to have this lack of care while thousands of healthcare workers are having to work day in and out (With a mask on!) To save lives. Consider this message before you enter this McDonald's (Or any restaurant really) because the meal you get can very well be the deciding factor on whether or not you live in weeks time.
And the fries were luke warm..",0

"Ordered 2 fillet o fish sandwiches after not having McDonald's for  months, ordered Xtra cheese got extra tarter instead. Had it remade got no tarter no extra cheese again. This is why ppl  are mad you make such a high wage. :(",0
The food was at McDonald's standards. But the upkeep of the restaurant was less than average. Garbage cans overflowing. Foot prints all over the floor and the fountain drink dispenser wasn't draining. Its had about an inch of fluid in the waste catcher. You couldn't even set your cups down to fill them up.,0
"Pretty much the definition of ""meh"" and ""ok"" service. Had the unpleasant pleasure of having an older lady by the name of Precious take my order and was just awful. She had the worst ""I don't care"" kind of attitude. Worst yet,  I believe she was the shift last or manager.

Either way,  if you don't care for the customer service, the food is usually on par.",0
"It's 6:15pm, line is SUPER LONG!! Waited a quite of bit of time just to order. So be prepared!!
Food was hot and fresh ( 10 piece nugget meal)",0
I went to this MC Donald's because it is the closest to my home. The food was well below standard. My fish was cold and so we're the fries. From now on I will go to another MC Donald's. This one sucks. And it wasn't the first time.,0
"Everything Very good, but I ask for fresh fries ,and the spanish manager there wanted me to stay with warm fries ,and I said no...fresh fries are fried in the moment...they should be taught to say give us a minute your fries will be fried at the moment... because the customer is very important for us....and period...",0
"2nd attempt at this location for dessert, didnt have the cinnamon rolls or chocolate drizzle for my mocha frappe ",0
I went up to fern park McDonald today and the manager kasey was extremely rude gave me a sassy attitude all because I was missin,0
"Waited in line for 10mins to get stale, cold, hard, fries. My burger was cold greasy, so greasy the bread was soggy. I mean... What did I wait for? Pretty much good on this location.",0
"Went to grab some breakfast here since Chik Fila looked closed. Placed order for 2 Bacon/Egg/Cheese Biscuits and 3 showed up on the screen and the female on the intercom was quite inconvenienced to correct my order. Waited a minute, but when the items didn't appear on the screen, I said ""Ma'am?"" and her response was ""YEA?!"" in a condescending, scathing tone. I said never mind and got out of there. Heifer needs a reality check.",0
Went with Dad to get milkshakes (drive thru) and they were actually out of milkshakes ! This is not the first time this branch is out of ,0
"Boy, this place is really going down Th He tubes. I ordered a fish sandwich and there was a 1/4 piece of unmelted cheese. It was cold and looked like it was run over by a truck. What's up Golden Arches?",0
"This is the most run down mcdonalds I think there is in existence. What happen all the new models they have everywhere else in Orlando and the country? Came here when I first moved to the area, and was given literally rotten lettuce on my quarter pounder that I paid 30 cents extra for. I bit into the rotten lettuce and that how discovered it. I had to talk to the manager and he though making me a new one was fair. Eventually after threatening to rep",0
"Waited over 2 minutes at drive thru pick up window,  gave me drink without straw then was told to pull over and park after waiting. Took over 4 minutes to serve me a swiss/mushroom burger meal. I was the only person in line and only one came behind me. Not sure why I waited over 4 minutes",0
Sick an tired of ordering food and finding out it's wrong when you get home and open it up. I ordered fish with extra sauce.  The box was marked properly so I left with it. Got home and it was about 1 tablespoon.,0
"I go very often but today is the last time...You guys never pay attention . i think a good 65% of the time i go,  ive gotten the wrong order in the morning.  Take a little bit more pride in your work, pay attention to detail and care a bit...",0
"Loud speaker at drive thru ""Due to technical difficulties we're closed."" Yet someone is getting served right in front of me?? There's a reason yall are called crackdonalds and nobody goes to yall anymore.  Thought with WAWA opening up across the street this would change,  guess i was wrong for trying.",0
It took us 20 mins to get to order and get our drinks...So slow...very disappointing...,0
Drink machine had no ice and didn't work. Hamburger was tasteless.,0
Went there for breakfast in the drive-through they sent me to park so they could bring me my food. I waited for 10 minutes and they never came out so I just left.,0
Regularly not open during listed hours on McDonald's website.,0
"The person who took our order charged us for a large meal and then rang in a small drink. When I questioned the girl giving us our items, she got defensive and accused the drink machine. She argued with us the entire time she was fixing the problems. Never again.",0
Worst McDonalds. The girl at the window had no idea what she was doing. She got an attitude and got her manager because she couldn't handle why we were asking for the new garlic white cheddar burger. Every worker here makes it obvious they don't want to work.,0
It says they're open 24/7 but when I got to the drive through at 1 am they said they're closed,0
If you like your burgers with extra Grease this is the place. It's the worst McDonald's I've ever been to. The outside box was only the beginning,0
Very poorly customer service I asked for a carmelfrapa got it with no Carmel because they didn't have any in the store I wasn't told at all I had to go inside from drive thru to find that out very unsatisfied..,0
"Drive thru is not what it use to be. They take far to long to be fast food, because I thought it suppose to be 30 seconds. And half the time they mess up my order.",0
The people that work there DO NOT LISTEN to their customers you order one thing and they don listen and just give you whatever they w,0
"Pretty bad salad. This was the second time the salad was not fresh at all. Turning brown.
Manager was nice enough to have another one made and refund. But not worth the wait.",0
"Asked the girl if she can drop me fresh McChickens please, keep in mind I got four of them, they handed me McChickens that weren't even lukewarm.
Smh.
Weren't even busy.",0
I placed mobile order and went to drive thru to pick up and told me to park! I waited almost half an hour and my order was still incorrect. What's purpose of ordering on line if don't get it promptly?,0

"ZERO STAR RATING!
15 MINUTE WAIT FOR ONE EGG MCMUFFIN, COFFEE & HASH BROWN!!!
And you'll want $15.00 an hour........",0
Always missing food,0
Girl at the window was nasty and major attitude. Pulled out of line and left.,0
every time i visit this place i truly get sick. i think its some thing to do with how they refrigerate the food.,0
Very slow! Drive thru line was wrapped around the building so I went in to order. Took 15 minutes to get a cheeseburger and fries.,0
I always go to the same place and today was the worst customer service experience ever,0
Went in ordered 1 mcdouble 1 mcchicken an it was a manager that took my order that didn't know how to use the register and charged me for 2 mcchicken a and a mcdouble didn't notice until I already paid an was halfway home,0
"The morning crew is professional, to they are a stellar group,  but the midnight shift is horrible, food is cold, desserts we're squashed and when I showed them the muffins she said""that's how they came out""",0
I ask for some extra fries with the order and they did not gave it to me,0
I went to use the ketchup machine and it was messed up it went all over my close I complained about it all they told me they where sorry.  And j just bought that close!!!!very upset.,0
Apparently not open 24 hours. Need updated info.,0
Very very slow in the mornings and employees are not too friendly,0
They seemed like they gave me old food and the fries was to hard and the buns as well,0
"Lol. It's McDonald's what do you expect. But man, this is bottom of the barrel. Even for McDonald's it's terrible. Drive the extra 5 minutes to the other one.

3/5 for food.
-5/5 for service.",0
Fries were cold and seemed like they were dropped back in the grease after already being cooked so were the nuggets.,0
Nice employees but waited 15 min for cold food,0
McD's needs to stop messing with the $1 sodas!!,0
The fries were old and the fish sandwich literally had a 1/2 slice of cheese with a pinch of tartar sauce,0
The worker ignored me and started helping another customer in the midst of explaining to me about the new iced turtle macchiato,0
We did not get the sauces for the chicken nuggets combos. ,0
NOT a 24hr store. Either that or workers that refuse to fulfill orders,0
Lost my order while the place was almost empty. Chicken tenders were overcooked.,0
The soda the Coke and dr. Pepper or both MD just straight water no ice in the machine and all the people working there are just laughing and joking around acting like a bunch of high school kids,0
Open 24 hours unless closed randomly for a few hours here and there...,0
They dork up the kids meal every time and the fries are never fresh....but it's a standard place.,0
"a bad service, only cash, at 4:30 am they only receive Cash, BAD SERVICE",0
I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and it was tough and undercooked. I do not recommend.,0
Save yourself the trouble,0
Always somethi wrong with my food I hot a soda instead of juice and my food was cold,0
"As has been for the last year slow, slow service. Went inside this time, no better.",0
"Dirty, slow, inefficient. They now bring your food to your table. They forgot me. So my food was colder than usual.",0
Pictures are misleading. No way does that chicken sandwich is so big liar liar pants on fire!!,0
Well don't ask them for a cup of ice you might be lucky to get six cubes,0
Not good waited to long for food and then the order was wrong..,0
Wrong orders....watch what they give you.....double order lanes ..mean double mistakes,0

Bread was  hard meet was cold looks like a old sandwich,0

"Disappointing. McDonald is my standby for fast food. Normally I get consistent food with decent, sometimes amazing service. I know it not going to the gourmet but better than waiting at an untested restaurant for more expensive and worse food.

Shrink-flation at its best.  Half filled fries. Soda with no refills. Seriously? Especially now that a combo meal costs $9.

At first I thought it was because the restaurant was newer but after looking at these review",0
We were inside a Walmart McDonald's. My granddaughter has food allergies to egg & dairy. So there are only a few things that she can have. We had ordered her a kids happy meal with apple slices but they gave us french fries instead. The beef frying oil has dairy in it so she can not have the french fries and they were all out of apple slices. Next we ordered apple juice. They were all out of apple juice as well. The girl employee that was trying to help us did not believe me that the french fries had dairy in it. A happy meal hamburger and apple slices is all she can have here. Was not happy with the service here. The food and service times are not the same as it used to be.,0
Inside counter served all takeout orders before any dine in customers. Watching customers that ordered over 10mins after myself get theirs first. After getting the food the fries and Big Mac were both ever under cooked. This place shouldn't even be open,0
I visited this location 5/5 at 5:07 pm. The 2 young ladies (black and Hispanic) that was handling the food was very rude and rounding their eyes when I asked for fresh fires. When she handled me the fries with an attitude here you go. First and last time visiting this location. Smh customer service training needed asap,0
"didnt give it 1 star because the food was good but around 4 days ago, i went at night through the drive thru and I gave my McDonald's app code to get the points, i ordered something that was 15 dollars in total and they charged me 31 dollars and the reason for this was that the guy that was taking care of the drive thru applied my McDonald's app code to another car order( my card is linked to the app ) and I ended up paying for their food, i know this because they guy asked my name and when I told him he said something to the manager and I said, yeah I think that car  is using my code , the guy just said "" is your lucky day go to the next window ""  It was late at night so I didn't give it much thought because I didn't know just by giving your code you can get charged  but next day I got surprised when my account got charged twice. Tried calling but they didn't solve my issue this is why I am leaving a review",0
"The manager was rude, I waited for more than 40 minutes, understanding that they were busy.  but everyone who wanted to ask her was stressed.  The worst customer service, additionally, tells me that my refund will be from 5 to 10 days since after 45 minutes waiting.  It only said that there were many orders.",0
"No cashiers/order takers; you must use their self-service kiosk which they have several of. You take a number sign to your table and staff will deliver your order to your table; however, this wasn't the case for us. The employee came from around the counter and yelled our number while she stood in the nearly empty lobby. We were seated less than 6 feet away from her and in her line-of-sight. We raised our hand and said, ""that's us"". She saw us, but made no attempt to deliver the food. I don't mind getting up and getting the food from her despite the kiosk saying it would be delivered to our table, but, I'm feeling a little like an unpaid employee at this point...we placed the order ourselves as well as served ourselves the food despite paying the same amount for the food that a full-service McDonald's charges. Several people in-store and in drive thru returned food due to being cold, old or not made correctly. This included us...at 1:00 in the afternoon the nuggets were cold, chewy and seemed old. I would think this wouldn't be the case given 1:00 p.m. is during the lunch rush. Fries were cold presumably because they were sitting on the tray well before the rest of the food was ready. Double cheeseburger was made correctly (no mustard or pickles), but bun was not warm/dry and cheese was cold/not melted. 4 managers were in the kitchen (button-up shirts with ties) along with 6 employees yet there was a lot of standing around doing nothing and operating with a shuffle-paced, leisurely-stroll walk. I worked at McDonald's and Burger King as a teenager and was always told, ""If you got time to lean, you've got time to clean"", and that was during slow/dead times, not lunch rush. I will say that the manager I returned my double cheeseburger and fries to (we ended up just eating our stale nuggets because we were told it was going to be 5-10 minutes for fresh ones) was nice and when I told her she could just microwave my burger she insisted on making a new one.",0
2 adults ww children breakfast meals. Had to go back to service counter 3 times no eggs in meal. Then again hole in cup hot water everywhere. Then tea bag had hole in so back to counter. Food was cold by time we all sat down to eat. No apologies were given!!!!!,0
"horrific service. this is NOT the ""world's largest McDonald's"" as people are reviewing on here, this is the location on international Dr near the OCCC. ordering at the drive thru took almost 20 minutes (this did not include waiting for the food), the man speaking kept whispering and getting an attitude despite us saying we could not hear him, did not correctly take our order, would just not say anything for multiple minutes at a time. i have never in my life been to a McDonald's with worse service. avoid at all costs",0
Rude and unattentive staff.   They were not even busy and I asked can I order my food at the register basically was told you have to use the kiosk and she walked away from me.  Not offering any type of assistance or making you feel welcome in any way.  I turned around and walked out the door.,0
"Went through the drive-thru and had a pre-order. They rushed us through, they were busy, then when we took a bite we found out that the Sandwiches were completely wrong. Not even worth going back for. It's happened multiple times at this location.",0
"It was a clean and convenient location, but we were quite disappointed with the service and food we ordered.  We clearly specified using the McDonalds app that we wanted a quarter pounder no mustard, no pickles, no onions.  We received a fully loaded quarter pounder.  AND when the lady delivered our app order to our car, she intentionally stopped far enough so we had to reach backwards to get her food.  She made no effort to offer the food.  She made us get it where she was.  McDonalds needs to review procedures with the staff and seek to improve the customer experience there.",0
They have new self serve order kiosks but they are very difficult to navigate. They are not very intuitive at all. My order took three times as long to be brought out. Good idea on the kiosks but very poor execution. While I was waiting on my order they had to come and tell two different people that they were out of what they ordered (fish sandwich and something else). Store was newly renovated inside and out and looked very nice but I will not be back.,0
Rude staff.  Slow food delivery.  Kiosk may save the owner money but it is slow and convoluted.  Not sure why you take a number for table side service and then have to go to counter to pick it up.   Food quality is poor.,0
"Atmosphere is cool and unique. Ordered pasta and cheesesteaks. The wait time was forever, service was definitely slow. But it was also Easter and spring break weekend. But what was odd was that we got our cheesesteaks and waited an extra 30 minutes for our fries and milkshakes. That was weird and frustrating.",0
"Waited to long at drive thru, while other line was moving. App code for deal canceled out and I had to wait for the code to appear again. Crew not helpful at drive thru or inside.",0
Staff stole $250 out of a bag that my little sister had brought absolutely devastated never go here such cheeky and careless staff I am so angry do not go to this McDonald,0
"Do not order here,  the fries were only full and they didn't give me any of my sauces very dissatisfied. When I called at 2:30 am the lady who answered was so rude!!!!",0
How do you go to a McDonald that says 24 hours there,0
The kids wanted it ...the kids loved it they had nuggets and fries....it's McDonald's...the service at drive through is borderline passive aggressive  but you can't complain well it's like say your order and here's your meal...lol but it's McDonald's,0
"Really nice McDonalds but the waiting is horrible, no one is taken the in house orders, only drive thru is being taken care of, I've been standing here for 27 minutes until I got to put in my order, not a word said to me about the wait, only 3 of the 8 desserts have labels. Right next to me a customer brought up a buttermilk crispy chicken that got everything on it except for the chicken. After receiving my order McDonald's employee I was telling waiting customers to use the touch screen, One customer said she didn't know how to use it so she was told by the McDonald's employee to continue to wait. I finally got my order after 39 minutes after coming in through the door.",0
Went through the drive-thru and ordered my food and when it got to the window only charged  for one meal and I had asked for two then had told me to pull over to the side and waited for a long time that forgotten about me. So I had to go back in and tell them about my order. And when I went back to let them know they  gave me look like I was bothering. I've never apologized ....poor management!!,0
"This morning 10/11/2022, went through the drive thru for my breakfast.  Two things medium Hot mocha plain and sausage mcmuffin. Paid and advanced to the next window.  Here is where things went wrong!
The blue shirt manager  ( last name begin with an A) on duty Had a serious attitude.  She did not acknowledge my order so she gave me the wrong order. She gave me a bag with a sandwich and hash brown and walk away as if that was my order. I sat there until she saw me and I told her I am waiting for my coffee . She said the there is no coffee on the order. I showed her the receipt and she walk on to the coffee and gave to me. Now I was going to let everything go until I heard her say these words after asking for napkin to wipe the chocolate OFF THE CUP.  Which is her job .
Her Words loud and clear
""FOR GOD SAKE""
I know I only spent a few dollars but IT don't justify getting attitude because this is your job.
I ask for a refund..",0
"Arrived at the McDonald's at 10:20PM, and the posted hours said the location was open until 12:00AM. An employee locked the door and barricaded it with a trash bin and didn't let us in until we mobile ordered, although another employee seemed confused by this. Another employee was also telling people that the lobby was closed (again, even though the hours stated that the location would be open until 12AM). Additionally, while this happened, there were at least a dozen people sitting down and eating, and there were empty tables.",0
"I퐒e never reviewed a fast food restaurant before because my expectations are never too high anyway. Father Day, drive thru at noon we were seriously in line for 25 mins. This one has two separate planes to order) The order taker was very slow coming to the speaker for all the vehicles, when paying we were barely acknowledged, but the worse was to come. When at the next window to get our food.. the person did not even look at me.. literally just handed a bag out the window, then handed the drink out the same way..partially angled down towards me. Better yet, check out the new crispy chicken deluxe. ",0
"Hours are inaccurate, they close the dining room before 11:00, not midnight as is posted on their doors. The tea also has the distinct taste of coffee, which makes it taste like burnt tea....gross......",0
Didn know you could barricade customers out with trash cans one and a half hours before closi,0
"Please hire employees that actually want to work and like their job and smile this girl that just took my order with extremely long red Nails was very unpleasant. Do you follow a dress code in this establishment? Also this must be the saddest sundae i have ever received, half the Carmel was outside the cup!  Maybe that",0
My kids are big on McDonald and I thought it would be fun for them. Big mistake! Place is a dump and a joke. The food was cold and the facility is filthy. The drink area had no ice in 6 dispensers. No ketchup. The play area was frightenin,0
The worst McD I퐒e ever been to! Waited 30 minutes for our food. They were just overrun with peo,0
"I ordered my food for pick up, and when I walked into the restaurant, it was cluttered with guests meandering about, which I understood the behavior after MY 45 minute wait, that was AFTER I waited 8 minutes to even be acknowledged by an employee. So frustrating, staffing seemed adequate, just a lack of experience in prioritizing from the young manager.",0
"Rude associates, dirty restaurant, I wouldn't bring my dog here to eat, let alone anyone else. Slow, unfriendly and incompetent would sum this place up.  Someone should hang a skunk outside this restaurant because it stinks!",0
"Horrible! I ordered the same meal I always order when I go to McD's. Fish fillet & Fries. There was nothing fillet about my fish, it was dry & stale and so was the fries. So disappointed.",0
"I am a client, I am a tourist, and how is it possible that it is closed and people have to be ordering by walking where the cars go, they expose their clients, an accident can happen, how do I do if I don't have a car like those people did?  How dangerous and disrespectful for customers, I've been coming for 3 days and it's the same it's 7 at night and it's closed but it says it's 24 hours",0
"Dine In is NOT available. I went with family but we had to sit outside. This is the case observed in the evening in majority of outlets. Placed pickup order and manager stepped out and addressed orders one by one.
Burgers are served with ONLY bread and patty and NO vegetables.",0
"Customer service needs some serious work. ""MOBILE APP?"" was the first words out the the drive thru cashier's mouth... not even a ""Welcome to McDonald's""? And the Egg McMuffin bread was hard. Not a good experience.",0

Dining room is supposed to be open until midnight.  I showed up at 10:55  and the doors were locked. The employees just ignored us,0
Food was terrible and so much missing. Service even worse !! Like eating at Karen's restaurant in UK ! AVOID AT ALL COSTS !!,0
Went to this location around 3am and placed an order through the app. Waited in the drive thru for 20+ minutes with other cars to then be told they are closed only. The manager refused to refund my order and also refused to give me her name. The manager that works there during the night should not be in management and lacks customer service skills along with the other 3 employees that refused to acknowledge us at the drive thru window. This location needs training from corporate and should not have the open 24 hours a day signs on their windows. Very disappointed in my experience at this McDonald's.,0
Typical mcdonalds I guess. The fries we tossed they were still frozen we watched them dump them in than scoop and fry them kinda gross. Should of been tossed out entirely,0
No chocolate shakes available?!  This location should have good stocks of everything!,0
These people have 2 drive truths but only takes orders from one stood here 15 min got skip 3 times and then was told to have patience,0
The worst I know it's fast food but corp needs to straighten this place out bad service bad attitudes for being so tourist friendly area this was the least friendly,0
"They messed my order up 2 times. They remade my sandwich and the chicken was still raw. They have nasty attitudes. You have to use the kiosk to place your order. There is no more service with a smile. An update I now have food poisoning form the raw/ undercooked chicken I was served yesterday. Don't eat here, I will never come back here ever again. My reviews have been see by over 100,500 people.",0
Disappointing for the largest McDonald's. Most menu's items were unavailable when we came in. Service is subpar. Kids had fun in hame rooms.,0
"This place really should be shut down. If they can't deliver in customer service just close.  I ordered with them and waited for 45 minutes.  I asked them after 10 minutes about my order and they said it's coming up.  After 20 minutes I ask again about my order and the supervisor tells me ""one at a time, I can't skip your order in front of other people"".  She then proceeds to continue skipping my order to serve other people.  At 45 minutes I asked again and she finds my order on a table and says to her coworker they never made it.   Nobody gave an apology or acknowledged they were in the wrong.  If you can't run a restaurant correctly then please just shut down.  There are countless pictures on their reviews of cars piling up and terrible customer service.",0
"They took 17 minutes for my McChicken which feels like it wouldn't take that long, and then they forgot my lettuce on it and the fries were cold, I'm wanting to bet that if I went again it would be better, but with most options out of stock I can't recommend going",0
To hell with this McDonald. They closed their lobby 10,0
Worst McDonalds ever.  No personal service or friendly service.   Stay away and have a good day somewhere else.,0
"These employees don know how to prepare Mobile Orders. You build your order on the phone and pay for everything you added, then the employees give you the wrong thing. I ordered an iced latte with caramel drizzle and whipped cream, I received a regular iced coffee with nothing that I paid extra for. This had happened 3 or 4 times now.",0
Could only order from kiosk. Wanted some extras but serving staff struggled with English,0
"Rude amateur counter staff, asked cleaner a question just pointed me to the front counter without saying a word! more expensive (tourist area)
Overall nice building thats about it.... food arrived to table cold!
Just like being in a Circus....full of clowns",0
Negative review.  One of the busiest locations in Orlando and absolutely no customer service! Everywhere else you can dine in except in McDonalds CRAZY!!!,0
Did an order on the mobile app. Ordered two sweet teas when got to drive thru they told me they had no sweet tea. Had to cancel and place new order for cokes. Drive thru took 45 minutes. Slowest I have ever seen.,0
This review is about the staff at this location. I visited this McDonalds 09/24 around 6:30pm to pick it up my food. My wife did another mobile order and I just arrived and tried to explain to the manager (I think she was) I have another order that was not on the screen. She was rude and answer 퐋ne order at the time?of course the first order arrived and I was still standing waiting for the other one more than 15 min. Another friendly Girl (Danisha I thinks was her name tried to help me out) and the manager stopped her and sent to carry other stuff in the back. She was in charge for drive thru and one Spanish customer was making an order. Danisha asked her to help and she said I can. I was shocked about this,0
"We went in to order and sat down to eat because we had eaten in other restaurants on idrive. We were told that we could not eat there, but way we were told was very rude.",0
Food is terrible but the workers are very polite.,0
"Hawaiian Court location -
Staffing issues really not helping this location live up to the ""Fast Food"" label.
From order to recieving the food, it took 42mins, and even then the order came out wrong.
There was one manager, one fry cook and one burger cook, trying to complete a dinner time rush, yet there were 3 cleaning staff going round cleaning 1 table every 20mins or so.
This team could really do with some logistical training on how to get orders out efficiently and on time, because this really was a poor attempt at ""fast food"".",0
"Brittany (The ""Manager"") was completely rude and wanted to call the cops just because I ordered a cup of coffee and their whole system was down.",0
"RUN AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! We just went through the drive through and the teen girl sounded like she was depressed and going to jump.

We ordered 2 doubles, 2 chicken, 1 large fries and 2 large drinks. Everything, every-thing tasted hard like cardboard. The fries were extremely hot and hard and crunchy like stones. Both the chicken and doubles had no - no - no flavor at all and was dry as sawdust and cardboard. For the sodas one was a diet coke and other was a reg coke, both were large size which they did not get right the first time. Both sodas tasted like they were full of cinnamon flavor.

The food was over dry and tasteless. The staff at this location needs to learn how to throw away yesterday's old food..if not last weeks old junk..

It's almost a guarantee your food will taste horrible And your money wasted.. save yourself time and go somewhere else you will be glad you did!",0
Horrible Service Lazy Workers Took Forever to make my order ans there liars,0
"Terrible service. Cashier had a bad attitude and was very disrespectful. Refused to give her name. Found out it is Brittany. Female manager seemed clueless amd not helpful whatsoever. After over an hour from the time we entered the drive thru til we got our food, it was still made wrong. We've submitted the issue to corporate requesting contact. No response. Obviously they do not care about their customers.",0
"Terrible customer service, the lady at the drive-thru was handing me someone else order after me telling her my order is an online order she then got mad and left the window then the second young lady told me to go to the third window without telling me that they just received my order and is in the process of making it. I called the store and the manager was nasty after I was just telling him that Communication would have been nice and yelling at me telling me I don need to tell him that and I asked for corporate number and the lady said they don have it and I asked for her name and she walked away quickly from me rude everyone here is rude and disrespectful and no communication with there customers.

I would recommend going to a different location that mo",0

"Only giving one star because zero stars isn't an option. Wanted to pay cash at register and was told to use kiosk. Kiosk never gave an option for cash pay. Employees wandering the store on their phones and ignoring customers. When asked for napkins an employee went thru two other employees instead of just handing customer napkins. No organization at all and rude as can be. Gave me diet soda, when I asked for regular they rolled their eyes. I understand it's busy but this place could be handled better. Go anywhere but here.",0
Twice they've forgotten loads of my order on uber eats! No refunds. Nothing. Absolutely a joke,0
"When you go on slow Thursday night, order yourself a nice Double Quater pounder with  cheese to go after a long days work. Only to see you get a single quater pounder, No cheese, and i guess they decided to throw in some lettuce on there? No sauce like 5 pickles....  Too tired to go get a refund :c",0
"Granted we at a busy time of the evening (SeaWorld was getting ready to close), but the lobby to thus McDonald's was locked even though all the signs clearly indicated they were supposed to be open for lobby hours. The drive-thru was open, but it was exceedingly slow. The service was poor, and the products we ordered were sub-par (even for McDonald's standards, which is saying something). We ended up just throwing some of it away. I typically do not leave negative reviews. I am hoping that they were just short-staffed the night we went.",0
"Although conveniently located to several hotels, the hour wait to get my order shows incapability to handle the extra patronage. They are not adequately staffed to handle the extra flow of being centrally located. Even when we were at the window, it seems they were still scrambling to put our order together. Once back the hotel, we discovered that one of our orders was wrong! They placed bacon on one of the fish sandwiches!",0
"My friends and family were denied service at this location because we prefer to place our order with a human rather than a kiosk.  1st by an employee then by the manager! VERY  RUDE!

@McDonald's corporate you need to investigate this location immediately. The customer service is highly lacking and I'm positive the management of that location is damaging your brand. Not only is service extremely slow but the drive through service provider and the manager is horrible. We literally witnessed people driving away from the intercom after waiting and waiting with no response. We drove up to the intercom and waited and waited. Zero response. We spoke multiple times. No reaponse. No one greeted us. No one asked us to wait. Nothing. Radio silence. Then we dro e up to window only to face a combative manager with a chip on his shoulder. Needless to say we drove away without making an order. It was an experience that definitely does not live up to the world renowned brand standards of McDonald's.,0
"We had a great dat at SeaWorld with the gkids and decided to swing by and get ice cream for them on the way home.  Well we get there and there is a line out the door because only one of the 6+/- kiosks are open.  We wait in line for 30min and as my wife gets to order they shut it down to only drive thru.   Absolutely horrible customer service and the lack of care from the manager was disgusting and extremely disappointing!  Never would I say this company is a favorite of mine, but now, I never plan to visit again!!!!!",0
"This is easily the worst McDonalds experience I've had. Waiting an hour for fast food in what can only be described as a dirty, chaotic nightmare. Staff are totally disorganised and management seems non-existent. Only getting 2 stars because when we eventually forced them to cook our food as we waited blocking the counter, it was piping hot and pretty delicious.",0
"Waited in drive-thru for 30 mins, finally got up to order & nothing. We kept asking if anyone is there. Kid finally comes on that they had to reboot the system & could be another 15 mins at least. We told him he needs to tell people as there is a line around the building. Truly horrible service.",0

"I ordered breakfast at 8:34 January 16, 2022 (order# 1386 order 86). We could have ate breakfast at the resort we are staying at but my family elected for McDonald instead. Not only did I have to wait an extended period (three to five minutes) at the order board but we had a large order. When I got up to window number one the girl working the window was rude, did not want to allow me to review my large order with her, spoke extremely fast and unprofessional then rushed me to the next window without even paying. Once I drove to the next window I was handed my food (still hadn paid) tried reviewing the order again and the woman didn listen or pay me any attention. I sat patiently and she rushed back to the window to collect payment AFTER everything was given to me. Our re under cooked (mushy) but the rest of or breakfast was good. I would relay to your staff that the overall experience drives a customer back not just the food. Wendy filled the remainder of our order efficie",0
It's not actually a 24-hour store. They're open but if you go at night around 3:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. it's going to be closed I think they switch for a dinner to breakfast but it's unfair for people who work third shift like myself. I can almost never get McDonald's. It's funny cuz they also barricade all the doors and drive throughs.,0

A woman back towards the back yelled out that they were closed.   Well we walked out got in our van pulled up to drive through.    Nobody responded.  We turned off engine a waited a bit.  Nobody.  We left and visited Wendy's drive thru.,0

"rude customers, half the kiosk malfunction and staff is not trained to help if it malfunctions, Managers are so busy solving issues with equipment they cant manage the staff. High turnover, homeless people camping out inside. Overall way to crowded and overpriced travel the extra mile and go to the next McDonald.",0
With the size of the big breakfast that would starve a child. Maybe you should start calling it baby breakfast. If you don't get cakes with it then you have over half a tray of just a bite of eggs two small strips of bacon and a dry/hard biscuit. I think a total of six bites and two minutes with phone in hand while eating and it was gone. There goes almost ten bucks.,0
"Zero starts!
All tables were unattended. They were all dirty. Food took a while. Manager was yelling at staff to hurry up with food. I stood for a few minutes ready to place my order. I was the next client. No one. I mean. Not a soul greeted me, acknowledge my presence or anything. Not even an exchange of words when I got my food (which I had to order online from inside the restaurant because no one was there to help me). Not a you're welcome when I said thanks. Nothing!!! I would not come here again.",0
Absolutely horrible place. After waiting 40 minutes we had to ask how much longer. The first lady looked at the orders then ignored me. The manager finally came and couldn't even find my order. The workers were just yelling over each other and at costumers. Never got all our food and was upset with this place we just had to leave. Will never go back and we frequently are in Orlando.,0
"Dinning room was closed at 11 PM. Hours on the door say 5 AM to 3 AM. There were many employees inside, but they only served drive-thru and refused to open dinning room.",0
What an awful place. Unless I am desperate I will never return here.,0
"I placed an order through the 'improved' kiosk system and over 15 minutes later had to inquire about it. Turns out the order had been completed but staff were 'busy with other dutys'; so it just sat there. So much for customer service. However, the shift leader did apologize. Honestly, I'd rather have hot food. And once in my vehicle, I discovered the order was not even correct. Failure level = complete.
My first time in a McDonald's in almost 10 years. Now I remember why. Given the choice, I have no need to return to McDonald's; ever.",0
"Well, i have never ever been eye rolled on a drive through before, but i guess there's always a first time for everything, we order shakes the (lady) gave us spoons and we asked for straws she got offended by this and eye rolled us.

I waited 24 min for apple pies that I know for a fact do not take that long to cook. Restaurant looked to be short staffed which I understand and there was an employee there that was fairly new it seemed which was also fine. My issue came with the TWO managers that were ""taking care of the guests"". Zero communication to anyone about what the wait was about. I deduced that I was waiting for pies because I heard the crew talking about it. These 2 managers were more concerned about what they were doing later and how one typically doesn't work weekends. Did not Apologize or attempt to communicate anything to any guests. The worse part is as the food finally came up they tossed my bag to me and walked away. I hop that this is not typically how business is done there but my goodness...",0

They will NOT TAKE YOUR ORDER inside UNLESS you use their self serve kiosk. I shouldnt have to say I cannot see the screen for someone to take an order. Why have the front counter if its self checkout at ALL times. It is not busy. I just left and went to get food from someone else. Why is that the only way to order. I work and live near here but will definitely not be back nor my coworkers.,0

I grabbed one of the nuggets and that look and feel like they were sitting since the next day I have to throw my food away never again.",0
Ordered using their self serve machines. Sat at the table as per the instructions on the machine. Waited 15 minutes. No food.

"Easily the worst fast food experience. My girlfriend and I were feeling sick from needing to eat something and stopped here. Location is 24hr but the doors were locked to stop ppl coming in. A customer let us in and we were greeted to customers demanding refunds, ridiculous wait times, and them being out of many items. Staff is very rude and condescending, and the place is very poorly managed.",0
This is my first time coming here and they made our order perfect then we ordered a waffle and we waited 1 hour for the waffle and the worker had the audacity to say do still want to wait for the waffle or a refund I said a refund and I was mad while walking out I don,0
Every vehicle that ordered was told to move into a parking space to wait for their food. Why not just allow everyone to wait at the window if service is so slow. The other thing that set me off is they had a lady in her late 70's bring the food out. She did so with a loving warm smile but I only hope they take care of her when the younger fit employees clock in. No offense she was a sweet heart just worried.,0

"Do not eat here, save yourself, time and money. I ordered here 5 times in a month and every time it was wrong. you would think I would learn. I tried to make it easy on them and ordered my burgers plain. Thinking the less work the better. Nope some how plain means ketchup only. Another time they put tartar sauce on my cheese burger. The managers tell you if you have a problem to just call the McD's number to complain. I am local so I have choices to eat at other places. You know what Wendy's is sounding a lot better these days. It's not even a short staff problem, its a I don't care problem. I must be a slow learner but trust me this McD ruined it for all others. losing my $45 order each trip wont hurt then in the short term.

We got turned away at the drive thru because they stated, ""we are short staffed and really busy, we can't take any more orders for 20 minutes"" and when I asked if I could wait in the drive thru, they told me no because the drive thru is timed and it would time out. I understand being short staffed and running behind on orders, thats understandable, but telling people you're not taking orders for the next 20 minutes..

When I finally got my food, the crispy chicken sandwich tasted stale, the texture was very chewy and not crisp at all; on top of that, I wasn't asked if I wanted any ketchup or sauces, the sandwich didn't have a drop of mayonnaise or anything on it, just oddly dry pickles, and a soggy bun. I had to park and go inside to get condiments. As has become almost expected with the McDonald's experience, the soda tasted like sanitizer. Never again at this location.

None of our order was correct and it was pouring rain so I did not want to go back through the slow drive thru. I mean McDonald's is what it is, but people go there for quick and convenient and those components were def missing on this particular visit. 占쏙",0
"I waited 20 minutes until I got my food but the order was completely wrong. I ordered two double cheeseburgers and I got one with two patties and a glob of ketchup on it. The other just had a party with two dry pieces of bread on it. The fries were colder than a dead body in a freezer. What an absolute joke of a kitchen staff. Just a bunch of high school dropouts that cant even make a sandwhich correctly. If your reading this, just go buy some burgers and bread and make one yourself.",0
Beagle was old and hash browns cold,0
"They made me wait in the drive thru parking lot line and still forgot my order that saysdd cheese? This has happened twice, yet they still give me the bag with the add cheese stamp on it with false advertising that it is has cheese. I am paying for extra cheese and not getting it on my food, it ridiculous and stealing honestly. This is the third time this has happened. Will be calling c",0
They certainly need to take a look at the way they are staffing the night shift. This location seems to be very popular at night and yet the management has barely anyone back there making orders. There was a giant mob waiting at the register's for their orders. Be smarter with your manning.,0
"Rudest staff ever. I literally just wanted water, I asked how to get water and this lady just muttered something and pointed somewhere. So I asked another employee and was straight up ignored. Tear this place down, it ain't working.",0
"Very rude employee taking orders"" slammed the window in my face and left and  didn't charge me, also called the manager and the manager was worst than the employee, beware of this location this people are rude and very far from being polite- horrible experience, staffsocks.",0
Took over half an hour to received food and it was stone cold staff looked demoralise when asked a member of staff about my food she just looked at me and walked away would never go there again spent over $90 dollars for poor service and food.,0
"I am here in Orlando on vacation and I ordered via Uber eats and when I got my order the happy meal had no fries. My large fries were half empty, cold and soggy. My deluxe chicken sandwich was cold as well. I ordered a large sprite with it and it was flat and didn taste right. Tha",0
Sometimes high tech doesn't mean faster. Location has multiple self service kiosk meaning instead of taking orders one at a time you have several being made simultaneously. Causing a backup waiting to get food inside while competing with drive-thru. Location still does not offer dining inside after ordering food. They had just mopped with 20+ customers inside so that was a safety hazard. Not to mention I overheard someone tell one of the employees that something was broke in the ladies restroom causing water on the floor.,0
Service at this place is a joke. Sat in the drive threw for 20 minutes waiting of my food. The tea is bad 60 percent of the time. I believe this falls directly on management. As there are always new employees there. Most times having poor attitudes. Also I have never once been suggested a pie. I don't even bother pointing it out as it would only take longer. And probably be un edible. I only stop in there maybe once a month when I'm in a bind.,0
"I'll start with the positive: The food I received was the correct order and it was hot. The bad: What was supposed to be a 10 minute trip ended up being almost 40 because they were severely understaffed, and constantly giving out the wrong food to everyone. Maybe they're better during the day, but definitely stay away from the midnight shift if you're looking to get in and out.",0
"Open 24 hours, but not before 6am?",0
"Terrible service, waited forever for our food, Won't be back.",0
OMG!!!...The WORST McDonald's I have EVER been in. Orders were on the board and they were just standing around like the had nothing to do. Drive thru was closed so everyone had to come inside to place their order. This was my first and last time I will NEVER eat at this location. No sense of urgency from the manager on duty as well!!!,0
"Largest and slowest in the world. Took 25 minutes from when I drove up till I left. Took 15 minutes to get my food after I paid. Also I did not get a ""good morning""or anything except 739. The cost of my food. Extremely bad service and attitudes from everyone I encountered there. All for 2 sausage biscuits and a coffee.",0
I would give 3.5 stars for the sugar free caramel iced coffee and 1 star for the sausage burritos. The burritos were very small half the normal size and very little filling or cheese inside. It's been a year since I had a sausage burrito and McDonald's has definitely gone downhill. Prices are higher for the burrito and you get less food for the money.,0
"Waited almost 30 minutes to get my food, while people with bigger orders that came after me, got their food. When asked what was taking so long, they said they are working on the order, then followed by asking me what my order was. After wards, had another employee who knew what was going on come out to ask me again what order was, had to stand there and watch them put my food into a microwave. The worst experience ever.",0
"Visited 3 times over a week during a conference. This place is a shambles. The self-ordering system seems good until you realize that everything after is shambolic. Twice out of those 3 times it's taken more than 30 minutes to get a simple order, and it's not even been busy. The staff (especially the manager Martha) is aggressive and disengaged. Overall a truly terrible 'fast' food location.",0
"I don expect 5 star service when I visit a McDonald,  but I also don want an employee full of attitude handling",0
"Started with me having to get the attention of the Drive thru by saying hello to the order com because 2 cars had passed on my right while i was waiting. Then I pulled up to receive my order I was given my drinks but was missing the one from my Happy Meal order as I asked for it and the person at the window looked at me like what was I talking about I said that i am missing a drink and again he looked at me like I was tring to get something again i mentioned that i have 3 orders with a beverage and a frap but i am still missing one then he began to say ok it is coming just pull forward to the next window as i pulled forward they brought me my items and still no drink and was still missing items again they looked at me like i did not know what i was saying and then finally got my HM drink but i was still missing items was told they are in the oven again waited 10 min with no one coming to the window to inform me of the wait I went to the window where thire was a person and again he was confused on why i was still in there line waiting on food, then the manger came to the window asking what is the problem I said I am still missing my apple pies he being to tell me they are in the oven and it takes 10 min I asked am i still waiting at the other window or am i pulling to a number lane he said no next window so I pull back up and wait another 7 more min I have now been waiting 20 min for my items.  If it was communicated that the wait will be a long wait, I would not have felt forgotten at the window.",0
"Prices are way too high, got pulled forward only to wait an extra 20 minutes. Still no food. Went inside to ask for a refund. Food still wasn't ready. Ask what the hell was going on and the cow behind the counter said ""oh our bun toaster is broken"".  Didn't say that at the window!! This is an I DRIVE location. Absolutely ridiculous. Stay away. What a waste.",0
Took over a hour for my order and they need a PC system to let people know their orders are ready. THEY NEED MORE HELP,0
"Service is slow and painful, lost McDouble Bundle option on menu for budget minded customers. Still giving it 2 stars, because employees aren't paid enough to say, ""Have a Good Day"" when you getting order at pick up window.

Change my mind next time I drive through and you'll get more stars...

Like what you see? Just say... OYE!

-The Blond One-",0
"One of the worse McDonalds I have ever been to.  There is no welcomes or thank you.  Service treats you like you are a problem for them, ie: the server placed the food on front of the customer and started to walk off, the customer said what about my drink.  The server rolled her eyes walked away, brought the drink back reached through the screen put the drink down and walked away.  No I am sorry, no have a nice day.  For me it took over 7 minutes to just get a milkshake.  Never Again for me.",0
Worst customer service! Don even bother to go ... We waited 45 min for someone to take our order thru the drive tru! Horrible and then the l,0
"To whom it may concern. Your curb at the entrance of Hawian Bvld at International Drive is dangerous to cars turning right to park. The curb extends to far out to the drive and is blind to drivers in SUVs are high sitting vehicles. I can tell by the damage to the curb, that I'm not the first to experience this and damaged was caused. As a suggestion you may want to paint the curb bright red or install a Yellow caution post to alert drivers. The right think to do would be to correct it.",0
I could not recommend this place. We pulled up to the drive thru at 10:48 pm and the guy behind the speaker said just go ahead with your order with the most unpleasant tone. When I asked if I could have just a sec he replied again in an unpleasant tone well we close in 2 mins. So clearly they didn't want our business and something tells meet they won't want yours. Save your time and go elsewhere.,0
"Manager is horrible, system was down had an employee at the register adding the amount wrong and when we asked to speak to the manager she called the police because she would ot serve us?after we got upset that her only response was system was down and what the employee said was correct not even verifying his calculations were valid (McDonalds was old-school at this point writing orders on a notepad). I understand their is miscommunication but ho",0
Ordered curbside. The attendant came out to tell me that my apple pie would take 15 minutes and he couldn't cancel it. He said he can substitute for cookies. 15 minutes later I had my order with cookies and still no apple pie. Frustrating. Their soft drinks are always hit or miss as well because the balance of syrup and water is never correct,0
"Sign on door says drive thru open 24hrs and there is signage under the McDonald's ""M"" by the street that says open 24hrs. They are NOT 24hrs, they open at 5. The lady working inside was annoyed that I was trying to get service at 445 and rolled her eyes when I pointed out incorrect details. Need to fix their information.",0
"Absolutely the slowest service I've ever had at a fast food restaurant.  Me and my 3 friends went and we all used the kiosk to order our individual meals.  After 45 minutes and having to talk with the manager we finally got our food.  There was one person working fries, one cook, on manager assisting the cook, and one employee who was supposed to be putting the orders together and delivering to the customers.  The last person walked around like a zombie who had no idea what planet they were even on.  He would pick up a bag occasionally and put it back down and the clear orders from the system and not give anything to the customers. Then when customers complained he would ask them what they ordered and the try to find food for the. After seeing that 3 customers who ordered 20+ minutes after me and my friends I asked to speak with the manager. He proceeded to lie and said that once and order has been on for a while the automatic delete off the que.  So he had no idea what any of us ordered. We had to give him a receipt and the he helped us 10 minutes later. All the trash cans were over flowing into the floor and the restaurant was very dirty.   All the employees including the manager didn't even look 18 years old. They were definitely under trained, mis managed, and probably under staffed.",0
"They퐎e telling everyone in the drive they to come inside, but they are making all 20 people waiting in line wait til they take and make a couple orders. Been waiting at least 15 minutes- they퐒e helped a total of 4 people. Kiosks are all t",0
"Inconsistency on preparing my daily French vanilla latte. Some times perfect, sometimes bitter, sometimes similar to the much less expensive regular black.  Also very inconsistent on getting special orders correct. Very friendly crew.",0
"Wow, just wow! Incredibly under staffed wich may have led to EXTREME rudeness.  Out of, or simply didnt want to put out the effect of giving, straws, cup holder and ketchup. And when asked for these items, straight out nasty about it! This mcdonald's is in parking lot of my hotel so really convenient but will NOT be revisiting!! If only 0 stars was a option..",0
"Was awful waited 30 mins for food in a half empty place, not what I'd call fast food then the big mac was luke warm ",0
We did drive through. It took 45 minutes to get 7 cars out. The food was cold and the drinks were half empty.,0
"This place was a mess. They took FOREVER to serve the few people they had. A guy dropped a spatula. I was freaking out. They would take counter order cause the manager said ""When we are done in the back."" So upset with this service.",0
The cashier/servers look miserable and when you smile they just straight up look at you like youre vermin to them. They lack personality and they rudely say stuff. Even forgot 2 items out of my order. Went up and got the wrong reciept printed and recieved attitude from the cashier who printed out my reciept.,0
"There's only 1 way to describe my experience. Have you ever gone in to a daycare, and shook a basket full of babies, well I haven't but I could imagine what it sounds like, and that's how it sounded when I walked in the doors, I didn't order anything, and the employees were on there phones anyways. So ",0
Place was rude.  Ate there twice and this morning lady for mad and purposely messed up the coffees won't go back,0
"Over priced why because they're the biggest shame on this company,poor service and worst the food was disgusting, got orders wrong HOW was ordered via screen",0
I guess they got to rip off their guests to afford the building the management staff are rude when you order a shake medium it comes in a little small kids cup I order two Filet-O-Fish fish or they're not offering the 2 for 5  but that's okay they're not even putting tartar sauce on the sandwich I was just bread  the Fish so I guess they had to cut  cost somewhere when they charge you $15 for fish and don't put anything  on it. I won't go back. Here is how to save some money fire some of those managers that are rude for your guests and that'll save you some money and start building the sandwich correctly,0
"Went inside to order because wife was dealing with kids.  No line ordered at kiosk right away.  15 workers and no one working.  Manager walking around say hello to customers and no one working. 17 minutes to get 4 egg McMuffins at 8 am
Worst service ever",0
"Another experience.

I was asked to wait at drive thru. No other customers were in queue. They forgot about me. The order was reduced without telling me. The apple pies were removed without any explanation. When I called to report the issue a woman who answered the phone saying she was the manager didn't identify herself. She was rude and short and when I asked for her name she wouldn't provide it. Bad experience with the food too. The fries were so over salted I couldn't eat them and the big mac had so much lettuce and sauce on it I was wondering what happened in the kitchen. End to end bad experience.

Hello I came to your restaurant this morning and waited an extremely long time and was ignored by your staff. I waited at the drive thru order kiosk, then at the payment window and then at the pick up window. Your staff saw me waiting making eye contact several times but continuing to ignore me. I moved back to the payment window and waited while several cars pulled up waiting too. When Mitzy who had ignored me finally opened the window was really dismissive with her demeanor before taking my order. I asked why she saw me and continued to make me wait. Her response was I just put on the headset. Seriously that was her response. There were at least four of the staff who saw me so I am really frustrated with your customer service. Why didn't she acknowledge that she kept me waiting and just apologized for the delay like a normal person. I was really offended that she was so flippant when I asked her about making me wait. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE and lack of basic human kindness. NOT LOVING IT.

Visited again on 3/17/2018 and had the same experience. Even the white shirt manager ignored me.",0
"The service was TOTALLY slow and it took the clerk about 5 minutes before they could even take an order.  I'm a local and I wouldn't ever go back to this location again. Seemed like a LOT of chaos happening when I looked in the kitchen area.  Also, clerks do NOT have a basic understanding of English. This is difficult if you're trying to ask anything of the clerk.  Would not recommend.",0
"24 hours if you drive maybe advertises as lobby open 5am-3am however is closed to the public more often than its open, with no explanation of why the doors are locked but drive through is open and employees will just watch you through the window, terrible service",0
"Sorely disappointed. Outlets in every wall and not a single one working. The girl at counter looked at me like I was dumb the entire time I tried to order and seemed like she didnt have a clue how to answer any question I asked. The guy sweeping the lobby was very cordial and actually tried to warn me none of the outlets worked, so kudos to him. Place was clean enough I guess.",0
"Please calibrate The Soda's Machine correctly.

He has been mixing and preparing sodas wrong for days",0
"This location is incredible. It has two stories. Has automated machines to order from. You can get a variety of different items to try out that aren't at regular McDonald's. It's always super busy here too so expect a wait.

I'm a local and I decided to try something different when a friend was visiting so we came here and ordered pizza. I was so sick for the next three days that I couldn't leave bed. Never again.",0
Paid for nuggets by time I walked all the way to my apartment approximately 25 minutes and we started to eat we opened up the food no nuggets,0
"On Saturday, at 11:25am, drive through is moving at 4 to 5 minutes per car, which works out to about 30 to 35 minutes to get your food from when order was placed. Also, only use lane 1 and you will go faster.",0
"The worst McDonald's in the area. I have lived close to this McDonald's for a little over a year now and have yet ever had a good experience. My order is either not accurate or the food is unacceptable. Also the team members and management just don't seem  to care. I'm not usually one to complain about things because I do realize this is a fast food restaurant, however this last visit has really ticked me off, I couldn't even place my order because the person taking orders in the drive thru was so incompetent, and then she wanted to act like she couldn't hear me. Other times I have visited this location,  I have had an issue where items were left off my order, so brought the food back to have it all replaced because by the time I got home and had to drive back to pick up my missing items, it would all be cold. I asked for my order to be remade and I legit watched this manager put my sandwich in the microwave ... I could understand if I had a huge order to be replaced but it was honestly 3 items. With that said I will not be back to this McDonald's location ever.",0
Severely understaffed for such a busy location. I've seen McDonald's with more workers in locations in the middle of nowhere. Expect to wait at least an hour for food and make sure to check your order before leaving as I and at least half of the patrons I saw leaving came back missing something.,0
"Took more than 30 minutes in drive thru with 5 cars ahead of me. Not only the slowest McDonalds ever, but by far the slowest McDonalds I have ever been to.",0
"Ordered 2 cheeseburgers with no pickles. I got 2 burgers with no cheese and pickles. The establishment itself was clean kept and had a nice interior update to it. The soda machine is a touch screen and you can add flavor shots to it if you'd like. So, if you like Russian Roulette, this might be the McDonalds for you.",0
"We were not impressed with this location. They locked the doors at lunch and only ran the drive-through. We made it inside, but that wasn't much better. The workers were not friendly and I had to order at a kiosk.",0
McDonalds International Drive had really terrible customer service. Not sure what's hard about ice cream in a cup but they were determined to charge us for a sundae and could not have been less cooperative. Chick-fil-A this is why I love you so much.,0
If you prefer to talk to a person then DO NOT go to this location. They only take orders made by kiosk in the dinning room.,0
"Worlds worst McDonald's. Went there on may 7th 2021 at approximately 11pm pizza was closed ,play are arcade closed,  ordered food to eat in tables dirty, asked several times to get it cleaned, and to get better in had to stand on a line for 35 minutes to get my drink because they wouldn't bring it to the table what a joke Spanish manager was a witch to be nice I say nasty nasty and a joke to run it like this she had no care",0
"This is the worst run McDonald's I have EVER seen in my life, the service is super slow. Its complete chaos. The manager should be immediately terminated along with the rest of the useless staff. I would rate it zero but that wasn't an option.",0
"If I could give this place zero stars I would after my experience here tonight. The employee (manager) handling the front end was the rudest individual I've ever met of all my visits to McDonald's in my 30 years. Her attitude got her confronted by several of the customers waiting for food. One lady said she'd been waiting on her food for over an hour. They wouldn't even accommodate her with a refund. Infact my order $25 took 40 min to fill. The store shut down the kiosks, as well as the drive through window to attempt to fill orders of those waiting in the lobby. I understand it's easy to get overwhelmed but when you're filling orders for customers that have just ordered while you have customers that have been waiting on food for nearly an hour, your prioritizing methods are failing. And combining that with the attitude of the manager on duty at the time will result in a lot of unhappy customers. I'm on vacation and will most likely never be in this restaurant again. But if I were a local, they would have just received their last $25 from my pocket. My recommendation on would be to avoid the smaller McDonald's in down town orlando, the management  lacks in people skills and the whole establishment functions as a team poorly. The girl running the fries and the font end had better people skills and prioritized better than either member of management on duty. McDonald's, I'd fix this ladies attitude or I'd find her replacement.",0
All that technology and they can't remember how to put two sandwiches in a bag. Maybe if they had a few more people instead of LCD screens?,0
Drive thru 10 minutes to get to screen to order. Then no one to take order for another 5 minutes. Can't get out of line. Trapped!  Such slow service. Sort of silly for this newly updated McDonald's to be poorly run or staffed.,0
26min in queue is when the manager tells me i have to make my order in one of the machines because she doesn't have someone who can take my order. Really sad i waist my time and did not get my strawberry shake. International Driveway to busy for this time of the day. They need more personal.,0
"I wish there were warning signs on the drive in. Turn back now- unless you have 30 minutes to wait in the drive thru to order, pay and receive your food. Once you pull in and someone comes up behind you, you are stuck..... Hopefully you don't want any Coke with your meal. And forget any all day breakfast items that will add an additional 20 minutes on to your wait. Haven't even tasted my food yet. Do not recommend.",0
"You wouldn't expect it but it's not as good as it is in europe, not to mention if you'll go there really hungry by the time they'll serve you you'll starve.",0
Service and costumer service awful horrible!!,0
"I tried to use a coupon to get a free medium fries from the Mcdonald app along with my other items i purchased and after the scanned the coupon they gave me small fries. I even heard them making comments about the free coupon. Also the women at the window seem to be fooling around too much hence the extremely long line during lunch and dinner times. I stopped by 4 times in one week and had an issue each time.

The young white guy at the first window is really nice though hence the 2 stars instead of 1",0
"Took forever, which I've gotten used too, being a very popular location close to the tourist traps of international drive. But the service and order quality has been way less that satisfactory more times than I could count. And not to forget, neither of my kids of my kids even got the ""Pokemon toy"" or any toy for that matter that they asked for.",0
"Absolute worse McDonalds I've ever been to.  Restrooms were a mess, ordered food, gave up after 30 minutes and gave receipt to some other folks waiting for their order.",0
Soda machine on drive thru window was broken on 12/01/2018 at  around 10:30pm. The person who was taking the order was kind enough to give me the option to go inside with the cup and use the machine inside but his manager told him he could not offer me that option therefore I was unable to buy a soda. Great Management Skills.,0
"Was awful at this location!!!! FILTHY!!! Had staff just moving trays of trash around from table to table.. The self pay was out of order, took 15 minutes for someone to notice we were at the registers to pay, with only 2 other customers in the restraunt. Even (while patio obviously ""designed"") patio was horrendous. Trash everywhere, spilled drinks on every table. Very sad since this location I'm sure sees a lot of visitors.",0
"Terrible service.  Poorly run.  3 out of 4 kiosks were down for ordering. This was the only option to order at 11pm at night on a Sat.  Place was very busy, no cashiers on the line.  Took a number for food to be delivered.  Called receipt to pick up order at counter.  Order wrong.  Forgot Cookie and drink cup.  Had to go back up to ask for it.  Counter person did not apologize.   I will never come back here.",0
"Service was incredibly slow, they were out of coke, dr. Pepper didn't work, and they have light lemonade instead of normal. All while we were in a hurry to get to the park.  Very unpleasant experience.",0
"Giant line in the drive through, had to wait for about 5 minutes per car and after about 15 minutes we decided to not order there.",0
I could have gave 5 stars if it stayed original. I liked the safari jungle vibe. I went with my girlfriend on July 13th at night time. It wasn crowded and surprised that they renovated and got rid of golden women bathroom ,0
Arrived starving from water park.30 minutes after ordering large order of food( no deals on that was on other branches) still no food so asked staff who said would look into it. 45 minutes later one staff arrived with sandwich only out of 4 meals and desserts saying rest coming. 1 hour later rest of order arrived no desserts and on checking burger brought was wrong. Went down to complain so called manager shrugged shoulders said other stuff sent up and was attitude of so what that was terrible service. Half machine for kids to play upstairs broke and ridiculous amount of tickets to get smallest prize. Will never be back. If u want mcdonalds go to smaller local branch as will have deals and hopefully better service.,0
"I couldn't tell you much about the food or service because it wasn't open. Supposedly 24 hour location but closed for maintenance.  The sign had been updated closed from 11pm to 4am and then changed again to 5am. I gave up hope at 5:20am when it didn't look like it was going to happen.  Oh well, good luck!",0
Went new year's Eve and was a disaster!!! 4 employees in the heart of tourist district..We ordered at Kiosk and waited 15 mins and saw that others that had been There for 25+mins hadn't even paid for much less gotten their food... Would have just done as much good to have shut the doors and locked as opposed to being open..,0
"Found the drive through staff to be rude on a regular basis over the course of several visits. If you can go a few miles down the road, the Sand Lake location on I-drive is much better.",0
"This Mc Donald's it's always really slow. Simple orders like a Quarter Pound and Mc Nuggets can take forever. I'm already waiting 40 minutes on Curbside Pickup and nothing. It already happened sometimes, I will not come back to this Mc Donald's anymore. Terrible customer service.",0
Sat in the drive thru for 30 minutes before being able to order. Part of the delay was due to another car deciding thier time was more valuable by cutting the line so it pushed three other cars besides mine back in line. Two other cars followed suit so we couldn't even leave when we wanted to and were forced to stay and order because we along with the traffic trying to leave the parking lot was blocked in. When I called to complain while forced to stay in line I was on hold for 6 minutes before hanging up because the manager didnt want to answer my call,0
"Unbelievably poor service. Ordered 3 items. 2 bagged immediately but then waited 15 mins for final item - a double cheeseburger. By this time first 2 items cold so asked for a fresh re order.  30 mins later! Walked out with barely an apology. Given the numerous bad reviews for this outlet you would expect a change in personnel. Avoid if you can, don't expect if you cannot.",0
"Normally visit this location 4 out of 7 days a week usually early mornings and staff dont seem to want to be there which is ok because it is early 530am. On 4/21/19 the frappe machine is down for cleaning at 5am, and now on 4/22/19 the system is completely down. It's becoming a place that isn't dependable.",0
Just went through the drive thru and literally was in line for about 20 mins start to finish. For being a fast food they are super slow. They are in the heart of Orland and do not do a good job. My French fries were cold. One of my kids drink was empty and the cookies I ordered were completely wrong. I would suggest going to q near by restaurant which they have faster service than these people.,0
"Good luck being served if you have questions about allergies. We asked one of the employees to check the ingredients of the chicken nuggets to make sure there were no dairy allergens. He asked his manager to check. She straight out refused. We couldn't even complete one of our orders.

30 minutes after placing our other order, we received fries so cold, when I went up to the front to get fresh ones, I didn't even have to say anything. One of the employees brought me new ones automatically after the manager ignored my presence.

The bathrooms were nasty, the tables were dirty, every trash can was over flowing, and the whole lobby smelled like rotten fish. This is easily the worst McDonalds in Orlando.",0
The rep did not my order correct after I repeated it to him twice. When I got to the pick up window I told the rep I was missing nuggets and she said I was not charged for it. I told her that I would pay for it and said it was ok. She then gave me a 10 piece nugget instead of 6 I don't know where she got those nuggets from but they were ice cold. I felt so bad because my son bit into them and was so disappointed. Although I was less than a minute away I refused to go back because I felt that was done spitefully.  Usually go to this location at least 4 times but will NEVER return and encourage any one I know to skip this location,0
What a waste of time we were there in line for more than 30 minutes. The woman at the window asked for our receipt and still did not get the order correct. We spent 5 minutes at pick up trying to get it corrected . When I asked for my re eipt back she told me she lost it. When I said I wanted the Manager she slammed the window shut. The manager  said she put the order together from the receipt. He stated the order screen only holds orders for 25 minutes. Not sure what to think McDonalds at this location in the later evening I would suggest do not stop find another.,0
"Horrible service- stood there for 20 minutes trying to pay 6.00 for my food. Manager was talking to one customer ignoring others, workers were in back play fighting. Drive through line was around the building and over 12 customers in line. After 20 minutes, asked if I could pay manager when she finally came by  register- she told me I would have to wait very rudley and walked away. She was very ride to customer in front of me also who had waited longer for his food. Will never go back there and advise others to avoid this mcdonalds.",0
We shouldn't  even be waiting for fast food more than 40 minutes . For order of chicken nuggets. Please . Also they wanted to give us watered down drinks . I mean i know fast food   isn't easy but damn 40 minutes really give me a break. Staff is extreamly slow. Won't  be back.,0
"How hard is it to give us the unsweetened tea we ordered instead of sweet tea. We got on the hwy, took the first sip and realized the ineptitude of the staff. Too late to turn around...",0
"Waited 40 minutes in the drive thru, and then they started turning cars away. Would've loved to go somewhere else, but the options were sparse at 1 AM. Got up to the window and the manager literally didnt even care about the horrible service.",0
Horrible food.....bag the  chicken sandwich came in had a disgusting almost like a gasoline smell.....and the sandwich was not warm at all....and the sandwich tasted like it had been sitting around for a very good amount of time....I threw it away immediately and spit out the bite I had in my mouth....disgusting... disappointing...and I stopped visiting the McDonald's on hwy 29 Cantonment because of bad food and sloppy service...and this one on pine forest rd Pensacola..will be on my McDonald's never to visit too......,0
"Waited in line for 30+ mins to get to order and they said that everything was broken and were taking cash only. Nice. I wasn't even mad, just disappointed.",0
"If I could give this less than 1 star I absolutely would! I spent 30 minutes in line just to get 2 meals and 2 ice creams for my kids. Waited 15 minutes just to pay and another 15+ to get our food. Will NEVER recommend this location to anyone. The sad part, I didn't have high expectations because it was late on a Saturday night and all of the theme parks were letting out and even my low expectations were shattered.",0
"Warning avoid this location at all costs.Truly one of the worst McDonald's in the nation. There's always an issue in the drive-through there's always an issue when you go inside the store. The staff is not friendly not greeting when you walk in the door they have no idea what the 3' ruled is. Whoever their trainer is should be ashame when they have the McDonald's conference in Orlando Florida. If I could give them negative stars I would. When you go through the drive-through there is not a proper greeting. It as is if you are bothering the attendant taking your order. There is no quality service. It's all about quantity, instead of quality.",0
"Employees I dealt with were rude. When they got our order wrong they tried to blame it on us not ordering right. We showed them the receipt and still refused to admit they were wrong. The girl went to the back and came back with the right order, didn't say anything or make eye contact, just handed me the bag. This is the rudest I have ever been treated at any establishment, fast food or not. I recommend everyone drive a little farther up the road to the next McDonald's than deal with what I had to deal with.",0
"Absolutely one of the worst experiences ever at McDonald's. Ordered a ice coffee and cappuccino at 10:13 pm..waited and waited..drive through backed up, 20-30 people inside waiting, absolute chaos. Finally at 10:47pm the lady asked what I ordered and made them so I could leave. Literally 35 minutes for coffee. Horrible experience, short staffed and totally out of control.",0
"I usually frequent McDonald's at least once a week, whether its to grab a coffee or get some pancakes for my little one. This visit was probably the worst I've experienced. I ordered my food at 9:11AM - A mcgriddle, a coffee, and two hashbrowns. Once I paid I was immediately told to go to #1, so I did. After waiting until 9:30AM with no one in the drive thru line anymore I went back around where a female with red hair came walking out with a guy who looked like they knew each other. After handing me my bag, I asked about my drink and she said ""What drink"", I said the coffee that's listed on the ticket you provided me along with the receipt. She said okay and then CONTINUED to hold a conversation with the guy standing right in front of me. I waited an additional 2 minutes and she was still talking and laughing with the guy while me, a customer was watching her and patiently waiting for my coffee. Needless to say, my patience went thin and I told her to forget about it and I had to leave. I paid for something I never received and was treated with the most disrespect in my book. Coming from a long time McDonalds customer, I wont be back again.",0
Wish I could give a ZERO... food was horrible and the whole order was wrong.. paid extra for cheese no cheese no mayonnaise on anything. Food was cold and to top it off the dime size tomatoes on each sandwich 7 sandwiches and 2 were right.. cant post the pictures on here or I would.. service unacceptable,0
"There was one car in front of me when I pulled up at 5am. More than 20 minutes for a single egg mcmuffin. I was given no explanation or apology for the wait either. I'm honestly appalled at the poor service, especially at such a nice location. I will literally never come here ever again.",0
"Don't know why, but ever since the rebuild of this site, the burgers are unbearable. Never juicy, dry and unfavorable as can be... From the little burgers to the quarter pounder, it's the same. Doesn't even taste like meat anymore. They had the same problem with the nuggets at first but that got better after a few months, but we'll over a year now, and the burgers are just like eating flavored cardboard. What happened?",0
Ordered a spicy chicken sandwich....bit  into the sandwich and it was a bit hard to chew the sandwich was undercooked.... not happy with this at all.,0
It was awful!!!! 45 min to get lunch! Lines of people complaining.  No ice in the soda machine.  Told them we wanted are money  back ! They found are food,0
Spent over 30 minutes waiting in line at the drive thru at around 9 pm. Finally placed my order of 2 egg mcmuffins. Recieved 2 egg mcmuffins that must of been sitting since the morning hours from breakfast. The white portion of the egg was almost black. They are supposed to make them fresh after breakfast hours not serve on from 12 hours prior.,0
"Horrible service... waited over 40 min for my cold food! No one wanted to speak up but i did, manager turns around and tells me we are short staffed but no excuse for them dragging their feet and cracking jokes to each other...total opposite of a FAST food joint. I would of had better luck and service an actual sit down place..",0
Store is unprofessional not open during business hours. When does that happen at mcdonalds. Not a good look.,0
HORRIBLE! It took 54 mins to get our food and then it was nasty. We watched the manager mix sweet and unsweet to fill a mans tea. Noone ever asked for our order so we pulled forward at the window. Will NEVER stop at this location on our way home from Seaworld. EVER!,0
"Our order was messed two days in a row when visiting this McD on vacation.

The first day they rang up our at the drive thru incorrectly AND didn even match the incorrectly charged order. Second day we ordered at the kiosk inside and they didn give us 2 of the items we ordered (an apple pie and hashbrown).

Not sure if there",0
"WORST MCDONALD'S EVER!!!! unfortunately I cannot leave less then 1 star. They have 10 automatic screens to place your order from, but only if you want breakfast, cant order lunch from them. A completely waste of my time and money! Your better off going across the street to Burger King and getting a whopper!!!!",0
Wrong order through the drive thru. Doesnt surprise me any more with this location. Glad I'm not allergic to the items I requested to be removed.,0
"The ONLY reason I gave this place one star is because I couldn't give it ZERO!
we ordered on a kiosk at McDonald's because the counter line was too long.  Come to find out it's because the kiosks weren't taking payment?  I then proceeded to wait in line FOR AN HOUR to just PAY for my food.  When I asked for a refund for my friend's food the manager pointed at food that had been sitting there no less than 10 mins and said ""it's coming.""  Uh, no!  Needless to say we got our refund and ended up going across the street to iHOP instead.  Shout out to the waiter at iHOP and the whole staff for doing so much better than McDonald's!",0
"Employees just hate being there. Not one person said thank you, please you are welcome. Just What's Your Order, Pull around, here. Put people who actually want to work and a friendly. Its not that hard!",0
Horrible customer service tried to order at the register and the manager talked to me like I was a child and had to order at the kiosk. Mean while half the kiosk in the building was not working.,0
One of my worst experiences at a McDonalds ever.   I waited in a line at the drive through for 20  minutes.  Get to the first window where I hand them my card and end up paying for someone else's order.   Waited longer to correct that situation.  The order at the window was wrong.  Waited some more for that to be corrected.  Finally the lid to my soda wasn't on so when I went to grab it in the car the lid popped off the cup and spilled all over me.,0
"It took 26 minutes for them to make 5 double cheeseburgers. I asked the manager Daniel why, he said they just completed a large online order. I told him this was the 2nd time in a month I had to wait an outrageous time for fast food and he just starred at me blankly. Eventually Daniel told me I was holding him up and making other people wait. I thought that was pretty rude and unconstructive for a manager to say. Terrible location, regardless of how busy it is, it almost always looks like a warzone inside with trash everywhere and nasty, dirty tables, and the wait time for food can be really ridiculous and on top of all that the staff is rude.",0
"Seriously you have one job? Ordered a stake egg and cheese on a bagel they served it on a biscuit. Ordered a egg McMuffin, served a Sausage egg McMuffin?? Best part about it. A MANAGER walked it out to my car. Y",0
I went through the drive-thru the drive-thru was closed so I came in the kiosk was not working right and the lady would not take my order so I left,0
Worst experience been waiting in the dining room with it full during COVID  for the last 20 mins with no help from manager two employees just sitting on their phone not one person has enknowledge anyone who waiting for their food they haven asked for anyone order number that is waiting or trying to push people food out I have been waiting for 20 mins they walked passed me as I was tryin,0
New and clean but horrible service,0
Super impolite drive thru and cashier. We had to repeat the order three times bc she was talking to someone else and they didn,0
"The manager at this location is Mike. I was the only person in the drive through. Mike opens the window and hands me my food and walks away. I looked him right in the eye and asked for BBQ sauce. This is how little Mike cares about his job and helping his customers.

Pure laziness at this location!!",0
Terrible processed unhealthy food that squarely contributes to the diabetic and obesity epidemic especially with the underprivileged.  Went only as an emergency.,0
"We went here late night after EDC. Around 2am, we waited about an hour to get our food. Whatever its the night of EDC so it was crowded ok. In a 22$ order, we were missing 2 items equaling 8$ and a sweet and sour sauce that they charged me 2$ for. After going back and telling them what happened, they argued. I eventually got the egg sandwich and double bacon cheeseburger, which ended up having no bacon. Still never got that 2$ sweet and sour.",0
"at Night, they didn't give happy meal drink. they have a sign for if they don't  offer new dessert, they will give a free dessert. But they never mention about it. So, I requested them to give a free dessert. They don't want to give a free dessert..",0
"By far the rudest customer service I have ever encountered. I went around 3:32am on Sunday went to the drive through my husband asked what comes with the crispy tenders meal she responded so rudely ""ugh fries and a drink what else"" he laugh and asked if she had a long shift cause that was really sarcastic and again she responded rudely "" cause who doesn't know that"".  I don't work at McDonald why should I know what comes with a meal every place is different regardless it's no excuse to be rude to a customer.",0
No napkins inside and the buns on the sandwiches we ordered were on hard buns....the sandwich and nuggets we ordered tasted like they were made a few hours ago.....I don't think I'll be coming again,0
Hire more staffing during evening hours. Waited about 25 min with only about 4 cars ahead of me before finally giving up. Be more proactive and tell customers if there will be a long wait.,0
Order from the kiosks cause all the POS were unmanned and closed. Paying by cash made this a pain but not only that as everyone else was ordering and having thier order number shouted across the restaurant we waited and waited until after 30 mins got uo to ask how our order wasnt called or even on the board we were told we had to queue to replace the order and pay. Utter farce after being here multiple times and having no problems this was a shambles and insulting,0
They were out of chicken and ice cream. Waited 40 minutes on the drive thru to get our food. Cash only. Their credit card system was down.,0
had me waiting a whole hour on doordash just to cancel my order horrible service do better or try,0
We are British but never had the same problem on our many visits to Florida. He persons taking our order just didn't understand what we were asking for. Very frustrating seeing as our language is almost identical,0
We ordered on the online tablet and we sat down and waited for 15 minutes and got tired of waiting so we went to the front and was told that our food was given to us ten minutes ago and it wasn't clearly. They remade the order and of course it was incorrect so I had to go and get them to fix it again.,0
No inside seating. Rude employees that barely noticed I was there. No napkins in my bag and no one asked or seemed to care if I needed any. I had to remind them my meal came with a drink.,0
"Very poor. 22 minutes of waiting on my order to be wrong and it was sitting on the back counter the whole time. Didn't say anything because I knew I hadn't ordered what was on the tray. Employees only wanted to do one thing and passing the buck to someone else. The kiosks don't work properly. The line to get your money is quick enough but the wait is ridiculous. Only 6 words of English amongst the whole crew. ""Thand you"" ""I sorry"" ""Come again"". Wel here are 2 more for you, Never Again!",0
"Often very slow bc of the flood of people. Thirty minute wait for fast food is crazy. If you use the mobile app, stick to drive thru. I waited 30 minutes for curbside pick up and 25 minutes in lobby. I recommend getting back in your car and going to Chick-fil-A. You퐇l be there and back with your food before anything hap",0
"No card acepted
Have men",0
"This has to be the WORST experience ever at a fast food place. We used the kiosk and were thrilled because we placed the order faster than the workers that were ignoring us at the counter. THEN they only brought 1/4 of our order. Forgot our 4 McCafe drinks and condiments. Then when one of the teenagers told someone at the counter, he was told to ask someone else. Really? You want $15/hr for this? I had low expectations because no McDonalds gets the order right but damn.",0
"Make me wait over 25 min and still get my order wrong, if you want to get upset go to this drive through!",0
Super slow to get food.  It appears drive thru got all the attention.  15 minutes to get food is too long.  Also when I order a breakfast meal with a soda I want the choice to get a larger drink when they are all the same price,0
I would rate it a 1 star but people would not take my review seriously. I visited this restaurant last night. It was very clean including the bathroom. At this time there was one cashier with a huge line and a bunch of people waiting for their order. The cashier was overloaded and the manager told everyone to order at the kiosks and not the register. This wasn't possible because nobody could pay at the kiosk; they had to get a receipt and pay at the register. I left 20 minutes later and went to Wendy's when the line had barely moved.,0
Terrible. Sign says 24hrs. Door says till 3am. Was denied service at 10:30pm. Attitude was horrible.,0
I퐒e had one really positive experience at this McDonald and one really negative. First time they were super fa,0
"Rude and drinks and food was wrong.  Asked for sauce for nuggets, handed 2 of them and window closed on us and the drive thru person walked away",0
"So disappointing.Place is terrible.The food is even worse.Took the family and ordered.Food was cold,hamburger rolls were hard and fries were cold.I will not be coming back to this location.",0
Avoid drive thru like the plaque.  2nd night queueing for over 40 mins.,0
"If I could give this place a 0 star rating, I would. I work late and sometimes don feel like cooking when I get home, so I stop at this McDonald occasionally. But, 99% of the time they only take CASH! Which I퐒e never heard of in my entire life. Tonight at 12:25 am on 05/27 I was getting off of work, hungry. So, stopped at this awful place. WAITED for over 20 minutes in drive thru to just be tol",0
"We had to wait about an hour to get our food that we already paid at one of those""self order screens"", it was supposed to be faster but it was a waste of time. Fast food? What a shame guys, you can do better!",0
"New system of ordering at kiosks is aweful. Despite the most important thing to me being wanting to order with a human being, ordering at the kiosk took longer and was more difficult than ordering with a human...and I wanted to pay cash which required I go to a cashier after ordering at the kiosk, very frustrating. Also, the new fountain drink machines are equally aweful, I will never order a drink from a machine that dispenses all drinks from one spout because no matter what you dispense it always tastes like a mix of more than one drink. Why has McDonalds chosen to fix what wasn't broken and use systems and machines which customers so clearly dislike?",0
"Sorry, coffee was horrible, 3 of us threw it away. Pancakes were rock hard. I cannot find the 1 I visited the other day. They had the McMuffin 2 for $3.50. Excellent service and food was good",0
"Not Brother bringing food food to table,long wait and don",0
Hi-Tech = SLOOOOWWW 20 minutes into waiting for a 1 person order as the employee screams out order numbers without the table number locator.  Slowest McD ever and shouting employees because of a bad system.  Not 1 person whiping the soiled floor or tables. Pretty bad,0
"bad service, they don't respect the time indicated on the sign, mc Donald's disrespect for the customer, constantly decay",0
"They ignore me at drive in and they serve 5 cars that came after
Finally when shes5 answer I ask nice why she didn't serve me and she ignore me again
Never ever recommend 0 Zero review for this place",0
This is not the worlds biggest McDonald,0
"Horrible service!!! Whoever that moronic lady working the counter register at 11:50 pm on August 15th, 2018 is, she should be shoved into a corner of the rear of the store indefinitely!!! The fact that she couldn grasp the English language isn even the worst of if. On top of that, she had an attitude and acted like her doing her job was an inconvenience! I get it, it",0
"No hand sanitizer. Biscuit was dry and hard. Staff wanted me to take a number to place on table, but I refused. No telling how many millions of ppl held that thing. The germs. Ugh!",0
"It was really bad, the chicken wasn't good, didn't salt fries, forgot the sauce, and when I ask for it, he gave it to the person next to me!",0
"Terrible service, I order a few things and had to wait over 20 minutes in order to receive my items. No one approached me and another guy when we were standing at the cashier for over 10 minutes. Not even the managers. I had to ask one of the employees if they actually had a cashier.",0
"Worst McDonald's experience  ever.  Silent 25 mins in drive thru.  When ordering we were advised could not sub drink in meal with McFlurry and had to purchase separately.  When finally making to window to pay, they couldn't 'find' my order.  For this to be in a Prime location in Orlando,  they completely failed the meaning of fast food.",0
"Never had such a terrible experience at a restaurant which is a big deal for me to say since my 3 year old is allergic to many things.  This morning around 12:28 am 11/24/18 when asked the very standard "" may I see the food allergy menu"" or since that wasn't available, ""would you mind checking the ingredients on the package while I wait to place my order while others go ahead"" the cashier was told by the manager right in front of me that she would not get the menu nor would she check the ingredients and went right back to laughing and carrying on with another employee.  The same manager stood around looking at others needing help during the rush without any movement or intention to step in for her team or their long waiting customers.  The entire place was in disarray from the back to the front with filthy tables, floors, and bathrooms.  Every trash can in the place was overflowing and the pungent smells both in the lobby and the restrooms were enough to make anyone lose their appetite.  Black Friday or not... absolutely unacceptable brazen behavior from management that I would never tolerate under any circumstance from my own team at any level of the company.  Zero stars...would not recommend.",0
Stopped in to get breakfast and there was mold on my bagel and the oil must haven't been changed in a while because the hash browns tasted like old oil instead of hash browns. Never will stop there again.,0
"Bathroom it was a disgraceful experience. Lobby tables dirty. Drinking fountain super dirty. Hamburger box came oily. Unfortunately, it was NOT a great experience and cleaning McDonald's. Better to give up on McDonald's for once and for ALL. You can base a restaurant by their bathrooms.",0
I ordered 20pc. Nuggets received 10pc. Nuggets(BAD IN ORDERS). I ordered pasta and what I got was more sauce than actual pasta. I had to ask for my cups because they they give it to me. I recommend to not come here if you dont want to stress out. BAD SERVICE.,0
"The employee's are nice, location is always dirty. Tables have to be clean more often. The food quality has gotten better.",0
"This McDonald's location used to be great. Since their renovation it's been just a disaster. Customer service is non existent, managers and staff are all in the kitchen pushing food out. No one at the front to help, just disgraceful...",0
"This place deserves no stars. My order, which was just a sandwich, was messed up three times and it still wasn't right. The staff was lazy and unhelpful. There was trash on the tables and filthy floors. Definitely no smiles served at this establishment!",0
Picked the wrong lane and did not get asked for my order as 3 cars passes by in the other order lane. I pulled up and the manager told me I had to pay inside. It took 30 minutes to order and get my food. Horrible.,0
"Ok, so everytime me and my family come to this place is a disaster because we have to wait a lot on the drive thru, I mean a lot of time waiting and they usually have us the wrong order. The service is not that good either, they have a rude attitude.",0
Order is wrong everytime i have went or missing items!,0
This was the worst experience I have ever had! It took 20 minutes to get our order and another 20 minutes to get our correct order.,0
"Plug ins dont work also took 20mins to order, the cashier was just standing in the back. Asked about the plugs in, she told us that it's not their problem. Horrible service",0
"This McDonald needs work. By far the worst, and most over cooked food I퐒e ever had. Just bought a cheeseburger and it tastes and looks like it was reheated in the microwave. The worke",0
"Slow service. They even work with one hand . If we didn't asked for our food after waiting 40 mins , it was just going to be sitting in the kitchen. The place was packed and the service was slow.",0
Didn't even get to eat line never moved and I left after waiting 20 min,0
Awful employees they all talk way to much to one another instead of getting their jobs done. None of them work together to accomplish any work task and who ever works the front ordering station is not well at their job,0
"Two days in a row while attending a convention nearby I stopped for a quick breakfast. They don't listen .... they don't care ... and they DON'T GET IT RIGHT.

I've repeated my request for something simple so many times in one day they should be paying me for the teaching experience. Product and service have sucked both days.

IHOP is acrossl the street. They listen. They get it right.",0
Really poor level of service. Waited over 20 mins for a quarter pounder :-(,0
"Ordered the Quarter pounders deluxe with cheese no pickle and one with no onion.
They both had no lettuce and tomato on them. I call them about it and they were glad to replace them. I go back and 10mims later we get hot fries and two sandwiches but both had onions and pickles on them..
#nevergetitright #McDonalds",0
"I want to give this place 0 stars - the self ordering system is inefficient and way more confusing than it has to be, and staff is unprepared. Not their fault. They need training but as is right now it's awful. Took us an hour and a half to get two meals. Ridiculous.",0
extremely busy/highly understaffed. waited 1 hr in drive thru (last resort) for my food. this is not fast food.,0
"Curbside doesn't exist. It's just a waste of time as you still have to go in and  when you try to go in, the doors are locked.. Most ridiculous experience ever!",0
Ordered quarter pounder on 2 different nights and both times burger was still raw in the middle. Totally unacceptable for place that sells food. Stay away unless you want E. Coli poisoning.,0
Employees just talk amongst themselves not fulfilling orders or payments as we sit in the driveways like dummies waiting for a bag of cold food. Thanks guys...all 3 times (different days and times),0
Past 2 recent visits my order has been incorrect and required remakes.  They have a lot of employees and all are doing their own thing.  Not an example of fast food.,0
It has been 20+ min and im still sitting here as I am writing this waiting for my food. And the employees seem too busy to acknowledge your presence half the time when you are trying to speak to them.,0
"Cold food, expensive to take advantage of the tourists and poor service",0
"For a prime, busy, tourist filled location, the processes and procedures at this McDonalds are absolutely terrible.  Many of the self-ordering machines do not work, when you use a normal line with a cashier, it's like the employees have never even been to a McDonald's before as they don't even know the menu items (I ordered traditional chicken nuggets meal, so it wasn't pasta, or some sandwich that only special locations have).  When you order at a kiosk, you can order things they do not have such as a waffle cone ice cream.  Then you wait 15+ minutes to find out they don't have waffle cones and wait for an employee to make a fresh one, which she doesn't know how to do so you end up paying $4+ for a cup of ice cream.  I did get my money back for the ice cream because I couldn't believe it took that long.  Don't bother going here; it's not worth it, unless you want to feel like you're waiting at Disney at a subpar place.",0
Can't even take an order correctly! Couldn't repeat the order back or even put it on the screen for us to review.,0
"Waiting for someone to take my order.. 5 minutes later told to use the screen.. no thanks.. I don't work for mcdonalds.. Im the one with the money making the purchase.. I appreciate the option of the screen should there be a long line, but for me to fiddle through all that garbage because no one can take the order.. no thanks.. there are far too many other options out there.. bye mcdonalds., no loss..",0
"Very slow service, took over 10 minutes to get two coffee's and cakes despite there being hardly any customers. Also restroom's were dirty.",0
Waited 20 min for a qtr pounder at 3am only to witness a worker scrape the onions off my burger with her bare hands I asked for a new burger she argued that I didn't see her do this  absolutely unacceptable,0
My fries where overcooked hard and greasy and the manager who brought our food to us spilled my drink on me never compensated I will not be returning. By far the worst McDonald's I ever been to ...your team is only as good as your team leader and this place has a very bad team leader,0
You can not get service at the front counter. They only cater to drive thru and kiosk. Past 2 weeks have stopped and after 10 mins no one would take order after having 3mgr look at you,0
Pretty cool but didn drive a 4 hour drive to for the cashier to catch a attitude wi,0
Extremely slow! Gave a free drink but didn,0
This place is really clean but the service was awlful my food was cold n they don't HV a dollar menu ,0
"Very over priced, but did bump into my nan so we did have a good catch up about Corrie, but there is a much better place near, BURGER KING. The straws are thicker and the drinks are cooler. I would of gave macdonalds 3 stars but the old women in front of me how took 2 mins and 47 seconds to decide. Yes I counted. Drew the final straw.",0
"Used the drive thru. Ordered three large fries. Paid for three large fries. Received only two large fries, and no receipt was given to me, so I couldn't go in and prove that I ordered three.",0
The service and food was terrible. It took so long to get it that I didn't want to wait in line another 20 minutes. Manager didn't care about us.,0
"Waited 25 minutes in the drive thru with 7 cars in line. Not busy, just poorly managed.",0
It took over an hour to go Thur the drive thru and the order was wrong,0
Manager is a complete joke with zero customer service service skills. Place is dirty inside and out.,0
Wait for my order over 10 minutes drive thru#2 Deluxe with extra onions. Fries where soggy. Had to go back inside to get fresh fries. Looked under staffed,0
Took forever and drive through was down. Took over 30 mins to get food after they said the drive through was down and we went inside. Terrible service.,0
The dining room said open until 3:30am and it was closed by 10:30pm.,0
Worst service I've ever had waited over 45 minutes in the drive thru for a 10 peice nugget meal..... workers didn't seem to know what there job was!!! Manager looked lost by what it appeared from the window.,0
The service was awful and rude. They messed up my order when trying to get it fixed the manager had and attitude even though I had my receipt to show I wasnt lieing.,0
"Staff were swearing on the tills, wandering around in non uniform and using their phones. The girl on the till in the ferrari jumper was flat out ignoring me as I tried to order as she was busy sending Whatapps to friends and the few people who seem to actually care and work hard are stressed as they work with slackers.",0
Had to constantly repeat myself. The manager had asked me to use the kiosk for a custom order when I didn't want to make a custom order.,0
Repeated my order 8 times. They still got it wrong. Called back and was hung up on when I asked for my money back. Called again... same result. Called a total of 3 times and each call was hung up on.,0
"Just plain horrible , 30 minutes sitting in drive thru, taking orders one car at a time",0

"Quite literally one of the worst McDonald's ever! Staff is incompetent, unfriendly, and doesn't get the order right or the food is OLD. As the manager of a 1500 room resort, I advise all of my guests to detour this location.",0
Slowest MCDS IN THE ENTIRE STATE OF FLORIDA!!! Stay away unless you want to waste time in the drive-thur,0
No one had on hairnets. We get our food and wasn asked if we needed anything,0
"Horrible service, staff was very rude and we waited over 20 minutes for our order. When we asked why it was taking so long the lady said ""well you can wait for the food or you can just leave now""",0
Horrible!!! We waited 1 hour in line to get mediocre food. We were told they were understaffed,0
This is the WORST McDonald ever!! I wouldn even give them 1 star if I didn,0
This location is NOT open 24 hours! Please adjust your google advertisement!,0
"Went there today and went through the drive thru and the girl taking my order was very rude, so I told her get the manager  and she was rude as well. Poor ass customer service if you ask me the don't even deserve my one star.",0
Raise all their prices due to the Convention center. Some sandwiches raised by $3. As a company this large they should be able to keep the prices lowered rather than ripping off all the people in the area.,0
Bought a happy meal the other day and they decided for me that I didn w,0
"Nasty tables, wiped our table with a paper towel and no soap or sanitizer! No soap or sanitizer in bathroom.",0
You have to order at kiosk. Several people were frustrated.  Took about 15 minutes to get our order,0
I ordered hot chocolate and they gave me hot milk.... I also order an ice coffee which was also completely milk. they weren,0
"A great franchise that has gone terribly wrong. Service was bad, order was wrong, and it's suppose to be fast food, not was in line for 21 minutes",0
Beautiful establishment both inside and out but the soda dispensers weren't working and waiting in line to get drinks and ketchup sucks when other customers are placing orders and facing the same dilemma...,0
Terrible service!!!! Waited at the drive up speaker for minutes before anyone asked for my order.  Then proceeded to wait in the line for over 10 mins.  If someone has food that is taking longer you should pull them up!!,0
"The nuggets from this location were the WORST I've ever had! Unfortunately I didn't taste them until I'd gotten back to my room, otherwise I'd definitely have asked for my money back.",0
"Worst service ever. They didnt have everything in my order and then look at me like I did something wrong. Actually, wouldnt even look at me. I will never come.here again.",0
"Took 15 mins to pick up my mobile order. 3 ppl working there and nobody knows where my order was. When I got it, it's already cold.",0
Sloooooow service! 1:00 PM and just got a cheeseburger & small fries from drive-thru because I was late for a meeting. Took 15 minutes for this simple order!! Really...for a burger & fries?,0
I am so tired of these franchises ripping off customers and upscaling the prices on items that are supposed to be a dollar! McDonald's just needs to take down this $1 $2 $3 deal. It seems as if every McDonald's I go into now is ran by either Hoodrats or Morons that are unable to perform their job duties.,0
"Not very good customer service at all except for the manager, more training needed to deal with people",0
"Worst experience. Drive thru line was longggg. I left the line and came back again at 12.15am, by then it was closed. 24 hours???",0
"Costumer service is terrible, approached register to order was told they were to busy i had to use the self service computer, talked to a lady ""looked"" like a manager she asked the casheir to take my order but then i heard how she told her to keep sending people to the computer! Managers are rude and not well dressed",0
"I work around this area and have stopped here a handful of times, every time I've waited at least 10-15mins and cashier's are rude. I will go out of my way to not stop here again",0
Waited at the register with one person in front of me for about 20 minutes without one employee even acknowledging our presence.  I left and went to Dennys,0

"Mario - glasses, dark hair. What an irresponsible manager. Left everything to manager Stephanie whilst he disregarded customers. Food missing from orders, another customer (young teenager ) spoken to like dirt by a female member of staff.
I tried to complain about Mario who did not respond appropriately (couldn't be bothered to make any verbal response) but had to wait forever for Stephanie as she was putting out fires all over the restaurant. You could not pay me to work with Mario or the newly appointed manager who was called to speak with me  but never came over despite eye contact and him making a grumpy sound(young, black guy who was more into showing off in front of the young female staff than treating any woman with respect).
What ever the main manager, Stephanie is being paid isn't enough. I saw her run, rule, command the show in a way that got the job done. She was gracious with all customers whilst her staff were ignorant gits.",0
"Waited 45 minutes for 2 drink cups, and then the ice machine was broken.",0
"Got nuggets and fries. Asked for barbeque and ketchup for the fries. Got no barbeque or ketchup, good thing we went to the big mcdonalds, enjoying dry nuggets now. At least the food was hot.",0
Will not make it with current management,0
45minute wait for food and a rubber over cooked chicken burger...very inconsistent with McDonalds standards,0
$5 for a 10 count of nuggets...?  Fries tasted like metal.  Change out the oil! Ugh!,0
Kept trying to give me the wrong items did not speak very good English. Food was hot though when finally got right stuff.,0
Took an hour and a half to get food but friendly staff.,0
"Epic McDonald's on International dr. Is lacking customer service.  Had the coupon for free Happy Meal from Visit Florida.  They didn't want to give it to us because we downloaded from site and printed not from tourist booklet.  Then said it was not actually for a happy meal.  Just drink, fries, and burger/nuggets. "" No box, toy, yoghurt or toy""  even though the coupon stated ""HAPPY MEAL""  no small print.  Girl at drive thru wasn't nice.  Prices at epic McDonald's are quite a bit higher than the other locations and no $1,2,3 menu",0
In almost all McDonald's I have been going have self order post. The bad news is when the machine freezes up you have to go at front and ask for help right? No help you need to l look ace the order again.,0
Fries were very cold children's burgers were creased as if once wrapped they were smashed with something service wasn't terrible but food put out was.,0
"Slow service and attendents don't acknowledge customers....I ate there multiple times since it was close to where I was saying and could get a quick bite to eat, but it was slow",0
THE SLOWEST AND TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Definitely not coming back!,0
"Terrible experience. Came this morning at 4:28am, no egg whites, no scrambled eggs for big breakfast. Long story short.. waited almost 25 minutes to get the order. Unacceptable",0
"Wait time of over 30min, and then they had the order completely wrong after repeating the entire order again at the pay window. Not fun after a long day of travel and you are just looking for the normalcy of a dang McDs!!",0
Pathetic. we placed 4 orders. all 4 were incorrect. not busy and utter chaos. ONE PLACE TO AVOID. .   needs a good manager to control things.,0
I waited 58 minutes to get my order SMHFSTS they need help.,0
"It literally took my boyfriend an hour and 13 minutes to receive our food. (two meals)
I get it,  things happen and it's one thing to be understaffed, but maybe corporate needs to step in to save this location.
We won't be back",0
Worst drive thru times. Waited like 20mins to get my order. This is not the first time either. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and it happen again tonight.,0
"associates would not help me,  they expect everyone knows hows to use the ordering kiosks.  then after ordering , associate did not know how to count change back to me, I had to do it for her.",0
Went here in a lyft on my way to hotel from airport. they were out of ice cream and fries.,0
They can't handle a lot of customer. Waited 10 minutes for my order outside,0
"So, they can ring you up at the counter but you have to order through those machines? Ugh. Place smells like disinfectant and bleach, charges tourist prices.",0
Great place to go and have you're entire order screwed up. Then have them tell you there's no milkshakes after you pay for one meanwhile they give the lady beside you one,0
Fries were cold and burger seemed very old. And we ordered at 1am you think the food would of been fresh,0
"Fine in the morning, go at night and the staff were terrible,  rude, unhelpful, lots of food not available,  I really thought the lady serving us was on some sort of go slow medication,  if we hadn't already paid for the food and the kids were moaning that were hungry, the server would have been wearing the food!!!!",0

"Slooooooooowest McDonald's I've ever been to.  Seriously we waited in the drivethru for probably 10 minutes for a happy meal and some chicken nuggets- and, no, they were not fresh as they were old and cool to touch.",0
Service was very slow. Managers did not work with urgency to get orders out on time while people waited 20 minutes for their orders,0
Soon they will just use 3D printers to make what they call food. It can't be cheese they use and nothing fresh ever. I would pass and feed your kids anything else .,0

"All self ordering machines... food took forever to come out, drink machine didn't work",0
"Order was wrong, fries were stale and cold, typical mcdonalds service",0
No vegeterian options,0
Manager stops doing uber eats after 4am so he wasted my time and gas that I wont be getting back. Don't do eats here you'll be disappointed,0
Was not open for dining in on Friday at 11pm- even though it clear said open on the door and the line for the drive thru was ridiculous. Better McDonald n,0
"I get off work late, made it to the McDonald by 11:45pm, had to sit for almost 5 minutes before finally someone answered me then promptly told me they were closed- I asked if I had it correct that they close at midnight- she said it is midnight, I said oh that weird my watch, phone, and car clock all say I got here at 11:45 and by the time I got to talk to someone it was still only 11:49 and she just told me to leave that they were closed. There was also 2 other cars behind me that I assume she turned down also. I understand real restaurants not wanting to seat people so close to closing, but my drive through order would퐒e only taken 5 minutes tops and I still would퐒e been gone before 12. onald is ",0

"I received a red raw Quarter Pounder at this location on 6/29/2022.  The order taker did not understand me when I said I had a mobile order code.   Though the contents of my order were accurate, my burger tasted weird and when I looked I observed it to be actually raw.  The photo below is unfiltered and unretouched.  It's upside down because I tossed it that way in my plate.   It was terrifying.   I called immediately,  and was requested to come back with my receipt which the manager did refund JUST the burger part of my order.   I really can't get over it.  Just a word of warning before you go to this particular location.  It was disgusting and disastrous!",0
"About half of my visits are pretty terrible but it's a drive thru option that's on my way to work.  Today my ""bacon egg and cheese bagel"" had no bacon.  $8.99 for a missing ingredient is absolutely ridiculous.",0
"I've been ordering from this location via Uber Eats for a couple of years.  They are no longer able serve an acceptable Breakfast Burrito.
OLD, CRUNCHY, NUKED TO THE PAPER WRAPPING.   Why?  It can't be laziness.  It's their business ... training poor?  EVERY TIME all other items are fine except for this item.",0
Order for mobile pick up. Checked in and waited at the pick up spot for 15 mins. Went inside and food was sitting there without delivering.,0
Unwilling to keep someone at the register. I had to yell after standing alone over 2 minutes to get their attention,0
They couldn't understand us. Three times we said no egg yet they still gave us egg. They gave us back our food by taking the egg off in our faces. Some egg was still present. My sandwich wasn't well done because the sausage was grey ,0
"Customer service sucks! When I get to the 2nd window no talking they just hang my drink out the window and then shove my food out. I ordered a bacon quarter pounder plain and I get  a mc double with extra mac sauce! 2 times in a row my order was messed up, not returning.",0

"Checkout took forever.  Only 1 cashier. Didn't  receive my drink cup, had to ask for it, as well as the size, also staffer didn't  give us the milkshake ordered. No sense of Urgency. They need to be more like Chick Filet. I heard several ordered after mine weren't  right. Disappointed.",0
"I ordered and CLEARLY STATED that I wanted two sandwiches, four hash browns and two ice coffees. They only put me for one coffee. I told them I ordered two so they charge me for the other coffee.
I ask for my ""extra"" coffee they were confused and said that they ordered me an extra sandwich so they had to fix that and refund me and gave me my 2nd coffee. I finally thought It was fixed, so when I left and got to my destination, I realize this INUTILE a cashier only ordered me one hash brown instead of four. Moral of the story, McDonalds, either train your cashiers right or buy new equipment because a simple order shouldn't have taken me more that 10 minutes of my day.

"1 hour ago at 11pm, we had 4 people, came to the restaurant but all doors were locked. We rang the bell, and one of the staffs pointed his hand to show us to the drive thru. We came there to wait about 15 minutes and no one answered us even though no one were in front of us and couples cars behind in line. We let a car behind came before us and she got no response, too. Terrible service.",0
"Did the drive thru today (08/22/2020 approx 11:15 am) the drive through attendant (who I can only describe as a heftier young man) was rude when I asked for a burger in my daughter happy meal. Not to mention I specifically asked for no onions. Not paying attention to my order on the screen, I drove up only to find the lady trying to hand me 4 large ice teas in addition to my regular order. Confirmed on the receipt that I was charged, I was not willing to wait for further fumbling about for $4. I said don't worry about it, dont want the teas and don't care about the $4. I get home AND MY DAUGHTER'S HAMBURGER IS OVERFLOWING WITH ONIONS!!! Terrible customer service, terrible attention to detail, terrible experience.",0

"This McDonald's needs to improve.  The facility is good and updated. The food service is slow.  They also mess up our orders often, at drive-through, in particular. It appears that the employee turn-around is high, so I don't really see regular employees here for long.",0
"Food was cold! At 11:30 am I went to get 8 people lunch an couldn't believe it everything was cold from Chicken, french fries, to burgers including nuggets. With only 45 min lunch break what a waste. I'll go elsewhere. WILL NEVER AGAIN GET 1 PENNY FROM ME!!",0
go to a different one if you want a good/decent experience. went through the drive thru and then told on the second window that there isn't an order from me even though I paid. then forced me to go inside to pick up my order that I ordered through the drive thru.,0
Got breakfast from this place today and found mold in my orange juice. Feel so gross,0
"Post renovation, this place sucks.  The kiosks are worthless because you spend extra time filling in things about your order that are self serve anyway.  And the order comes out wrong anyway.  Also, have 2 boys and instead of explaining there are no boy toys, they just throw girl toys in instead.  Also... No sauce dispensers??? Now gotta open tons of packets? Down hill for sure.",0

"Its really annoying that Google does not seem to let you report an Unknown Closed.  I do not know if the location is permanently closed.  All I know is that I visited on Sept. 11 and there store and some of the surrounding parking was blocked off with fencing, the store did not seem to be conducting business, and there seemed to be some dumpsters and signs of demolition.  No indication of nature or duration of the closure.  Hence cannot say if its permanent.  But they seem like they may be closed for a while.  No notice beforehand from staff or signs.",0
"Every single time I have gone through the drive thru at this location, it has taken at least 20 minutes to complete the transaction. They have a sauce they're advertising on a poster at the drive through that says ""Honey"" sauce, but when you get to the window, no one knows what you're talking about.
Anyhow, the most recent experience was a great example of poor customer service and why we won't be returning to this location.
Waiting at the drive thru for almost half an hour like usual, the manager comes to the window where they give you your food and says that our (my husband and I's) nuggets aren't done yet and requests us to park nearby to wait. That's fine, as we do so without complaint. The manager comes out 5-10 minutes later to give us our food. We take it and get home to find that the bottom box in the bag was some nasty ass Buttermilk Crispy Chicken sandwich, and not 20piece nuggets. That's not what we paid for or ordered. We go back to this McDonalds another day and ask for the manager; his employees had to yell for him and almost convince him to come up to the window, as I heard them yelling to him, ""They want to talk to you!"" countless times, as if he asked out of frustration and anger. After he was torn away from the slow work he wasn't helping with while in his office, he pretended he didn't understand what I said and said he couldn't write anything or give me a coupon for anything since he didn't have some kind of coupon book? I asked him if he could give us  what we bought next time since we had already paid. He said yes and we left. Yesterday was the last day we visited this location; and we asked for the manager at the first pay window. He acted like he had no idea who we were after that whole ordeal and gave us HALF off our 20 piece nuggets that we were buying! He lied to our faces after he said he would take care of it! You would think how much revenue, McDonalds brings in, the manager wouldn't be so stingy and would apologize and provide what's necessary to remediate the situation! He acted so snide and unapologetic too. Needless to say, experiencing slow service, disrespect and a poor account of responsibilities; we won't be returning.",0
The worst possible McDonald's in the eastern side when ever I go to get breakfast im always either missing something or my order is never taken correctly and the ice cream machine is either being washed or Is broken at 9pm they either wash the machine early so they can leave early and the crew there is just terrible they never seem to have anything,0
How do you run completely out of fish filet at 7 pm on a Thursday night that is not during Lent? Inventory control must be non-existent. Sound like pretty piss poor management.,0

"We usually always go before the zoo because it was cutely decorated to the zoo theme and the kids enjoy the experience. Service has always been meh but the atmosphere made up for it. Now it's just a boring, modern McDonald's with bleh service. The remodel was a mistake and if you're going to take away the only appealing part of the place at least make sure the service improves. Probably won't come back during our zoo trips anymore. 占쏙",0

Everyone was hiding in the back so nobody to take our order for almost 7 minutes.   Had I walked around and noticed the mess, we would have left.

As I'm writing this, I noticed there is a wrapper glued to my shoe.   The only nice person was the homeless lady sitting in the corner.

The workers are really rude, don know how to work, take millions of year to prepare the food OR take your order and when you try to ask for basic things like drinks they treat you bad or ignore you. I waited for them to give me my coke for around 15 minutes and when they finally hand it to me, it was a Dr. pepper, guess what? I waited 10 minutes more for them to have the decency to",0
"After visiting with a friend quite a distance from our home this past week, we stopped off at this McDonald location to get us a late night dinner. I really wanted an Oreo McFlurry and was willing to even settle for some fresh baked or classic McDonald character bag of cookies, but they said that their ice cream machine was down and they were completely out of any and all cookies (sad face). As we pulled away from the drive-thru and continued on our way to our final destination, we realized that they gave us the wrong order. We spent about $20, but only received maybe $5 worth of food. The lobby was closed, the line was long, and we were too tired to turn back. I tried calling this location more than 3 times and even submitted a complaint/help request via the McDonald app to try and get some sort of resolution to their mistake, yet I still have notignoring all of my attempts?",0
They have destroyed their animal themed building and now it's boring. Not worth going to anymore. Why are McDonald's creating such boring buildings? What a waste of money! It doesn't make sense. It's as if they are deliberately trying to lose money and encourage people to stay away.,0
SLOW SLOW SLOW and the younger people there are so RUDE!!! New renovation but same slow workers and RUDENESS ...this past Saturday waited 15 min in drive thru and never placed an order we as many as 10 cars backed out and left,0
"We bought food and drinks with the kids. After playing in the play place we tried to get refills on our sodas and were told they do not offer refills and we would have to buy another. There were no signs or anything stating such, and I've never seen another McDonald's telling people this, so I'm pretty sure the worker just lied to us.",0

BE AWARE : There was a MAN that looked weird. He asked me for money and my boyfriend for a cigarette then he wouldn't leave us ALONE until I said I was calling the cops!!!!The place is cool because of the decorations but  -1 The burger was greasy disgusting -2 French fries NOT fully cooked -3 One of the workers was not even wearing an hat -4 She messed up the order and behind me there was another Lady mad due to a wrong order,0
If you want to watch employee's fight and spend a half a hour waiting on fries and a Frappe this is the McDonalds for you. Service between 5 - 6 am horrible and the 10pm line is backed up onto Ewing Ave. Very Childish and unpleasant employee's.,0

They or rude and order was wrong food was cold . When I ask for hot food the employee was upset and said she about to complain about her food your right because I paid my money for it yes and for her to be so rude no customer service at all who really over this place no one could just allow y,0
"Extremely hot in play area even after renovation. Customer service not good, French fries are not fresh.",0
I visit this place often but after witnessing the tall guy in a manager uniform one day doing a drug exchange in the parking lot. would rather not bring my kids here to witness this type of thing.the owner should be ashamed of themselves for allowing drugs,0
Newly removed.  You would think this place would be better.  Yuck it worse!!  My bread on my Big Mac was moldy and my chick,0
Boycotting until McDonald corporate corrects the issue and brings all the animals back at this location. If they only knew that was why peopl,0
Normally every experience I퐒e had at this location has gone smoothly but unfortunately this Sunday when my family and I arrived the employees weren in the best mood. Rushing thru my order and taking it in correctly missing items that were not even on my receipt had to get in line again. The staff very unwilling to help over hearing a conversation with another customer a Hispanic father and young daughter trying to pick up a order and knowing very little English the employee being rude and acting like she couldn understand. Just plain old being disrespectful that my husband had t,0
Apparently when ordering counter pickup after 9 or 10 they don't allow you to and gotta go through drive-through,0
Worst thing here at this location is ordering from the app an waiting for your order over 20 minutes now they need to get better service.,0
"The App let's you order breakfast and pay ahead, but when you show up and it's 10:03, their system won't let them complete your order.

The location is relatively good, the employees are always friend and fast.

But someone needs to pass along yo the corporate office/app devs and need to either decide to

1) prepare prepaid breakfast orders and have them ready before the 10:00 shut off, or

2) allow them to prepare my prepaid breakfast order 3 minutes after ""it's no longer breakfast time""

I do not want to eat a burger as my first meal of the day at 10:03 on the way to work.",0
Horrible costumer service the lady taking my order never even talked to me I even told her thank you after she had taken my order to be polite and she just turned around she filled the fries I didnt even care to complain but as u can tell from the picture I would have got more out of a small at most mcdonalds,0
The food was good but only 1 stall for going to the restroom,0
I can believe how rude this people is,0
Rude staff complaining about us sitting at a table. All because they don want to do their job. Should of ,0
"Update. Placed an order at the counter. Attendant took my order, upon me handing her my cash I was told she didn't have all my change and would that be OK. I said no and left. Great scam Manager, round up, why not round down?",0
Used to be a fun place to go to but everything has changed,0
Gave me wrong order. She doesn,0
"So, I got to this location frequently, despite hearing the horror stories about this location, because it is close to me. Well, tonight my order was messed up and they yelled at me about it.
First, I tell the person taking my order that I would like a Bacon Double Quarter Pounder w/ Cheese, Tea for the drink, make the combo a large. So, the first thing we have a discussion about is that he gave me an unsweetened tea on the screen. I tell him I would like a sweet tea for the drink, and he tells me that I ordered it wrong. I said, ""Well, normally when I come here, they default to sweet tea."" I said that because they usually do  He said, ""Nah! That's not how we do it. Then, he clears the entire order and puts in a Quarter Pounder with Cheese.

I tell him that I ordered a Bacon Double Quarter with Cheese, sweet tea, and make the combo a large. I saw that it was not right on the screen, but he repeated the order to me correctly.  I pulled around to pay for the order and waited on it to be served to me. I checked the order and told the person at the window that it was not a double. The person at the window talked to the person who took my order, and he came to the window and yelled, ""I MADE WHAT YOU ORDERED."" I told him that I said ""double"" several times when I ordered, 5 times to be exact. He person who took my order, who looked to be a manager, yelled at me, ""NO! IT WAS THE WAY YOU ORDERED IT. YOU ASKED FOR A SINGLE.""

I repeated that I asked for a Bacon Double Quarter with cheese and he started arguing with me about how to order sweet tea. He finally told me that he would make it order, but I did not trust him at this point, so I said that I was leaving and I would not be back.

This was an awful experience and I will not be back. I will also tell my friends and family to avoid this location despite that it has served our community over 10 years.",0
Worst and slowest McDonald's I've ever been.,0
When this McDonald's first opened. OMG it was cool seeing the zoo theme. The animatronics made noise and moved. The service WAS excellent. But now it looks like a tourist trap. Some days you'll sit at the drive through line for a long time then get told to wait in a parking spot. Whoever owns this franchise should be proud of it and maintain it's quality that it had. As far as the food goes. Well it's McDonald's same as any other.,0
Never get my order correct always something missing !!!!!,0
Line is ridiculous. They need new and faster workers,0
"Staff was very rude, not the one at the counter but the manager was yelling at me to come get our food. Me being pregnant and just visiting the zoo, I was letting my husband get the food after he was finished getting the kids drinks as the lady continuously yelled at me to get my food! Very unprofessional.",0
"Went to drive thru window at around 11:30 ish and employee with copper tone hair like was very rude and disrespectful I was gonna ask her a question about another order that I wanted added to my order and she rudely said no , when I get to th window I asked her if that was her that I was talking to she said yes talking about that there only two employees working mind u it customer service how hard can that be also wen I get my food and I get home I checked my food and it was spitt on my food , I understand that you guys ar understaffed but that is no way to give customer service I will be making sure that",0
First I only added the 1 star because that's the only way to do a review ... I  had 4 drinks so full they were spilling through the lids.. the woman at the window saw it spilling and still passed while they were dripping... guessing she saw a look on my face... this woman looked me in my face and said it's just a little bit... and closed the window ... so I she came back to the window with half of my order... my son opened his cheese burger and looks like a arm hair... a eyebrow... or puuuuub (maybe)... I asked for napkins she gave me sooo many napkins... I'm like you should've fix this before you gave it to me.. i. worst of the worst experience... ,0
Rudest night crew I've ever experienced. The boy they have acting as a manager is horrible and very unprofessional. All they do is blast rap music and play with each other and be rude to the customers.,0
"Night employees are stealing from customers, and probably the restaurant as well.
They short changed me twice on the same order, and claimed the receipt machine was ""not working"" when i asked for the receipt.",0
"I could not eat the food from the zoo McDonald's so I gave the food to the cats outside...and the cats outside my house did not even take a wiff at it...idk?
Becarefull with the food up there in the Zoo McDonald's?",0
I used to love McDonald's fries but not no more. You can't never really get anything fresh from McDonald's. I used to tell them could they make my McChicken now when they did it taste so much better. But everything is preheated or been waiting for you LOL,0
"They where not friendly. The girl at the drive through was on her phone and didnt give us change or receipt. Got to the 2nd window was handed our drinks and asked to pull in a spot. Waited at least 15 mins before anyone came out to our car. Asked what we ordered....and for our receipt ..which we didnt have....
Finally brought our food out and 2 burgers where wrong...",0
My order was handed to someone else who IMMEDIATELY ATE MY FRIES! MGMT OFFERED TO REMAKE MY ORDER FRESH WHICH I AGREED. THE ORDER CAME OUT LESS THAN 30SECS LATER. I USED TO WORK FOR MC.Ds AND OTHER FF RESTAURANTS AND I KNEW THAT WASN'T RIGHT!! TRASHED THE FOOD.SMDH!!!0,0
"Just avoid. This was by far the worst experience I've ever had with a McDonald's. I feel like you have to be trying to be terrible to be as bad as this location. There are other McDonald's close by, don't bother with this place.",0
"DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS MCDONALDS.
I ORDERED 4 MEALS THROUGH UBER EATS
AND ALL I GOT WAS THE BURGERS
NO FRIES
NO SAUCES
NO DRINKS!!!!
I EVEN ORDERED A MCFLURRY.
ALL I GOT WAS BURGERS.",0
Why remove the animals??.. This remodel looks cold & uninviting.. Horrible,0
"Food was definitely not even close to being fresh ""ish""and the location, although you'd think is convenient after visiting the zoo ... It's a wreck waiting to happen if you try to drive in to their location.",0
Who idea was it to destroy the famous zoo McDonalds ??? I hope revenue sales go down the drain.,0
In drive through at 10:58 AM- tried ordering lunch. I was told they couldn't take my order. I told them I'd just wait 2 minutes... LIke the car ahead of me that took 5 minutes to order. No big deal right? Nope manager comes out and yells at me to move/pull around she didn't care... I just had to move. 1 car was behind me still ordering. Would have thought I was blocking a fire escape or something. By the time I actually got through the drive through (due to cars ahead of me) it was 11:01AM... Really smart move guys. I'll happily take my business elsewhere. No longer stopping by after zoo trips with the kids.,0
"I work five minutes away from this store, so I go there all the time. Everytime I go there's a problem. This time my bun was so hard. The bottom bun. There's always something wrong. I worked for this same company for a lot of years,(swing manager). It's crazy. I've only got good service once or twice there.",0
Did not know that at this mc Donald u have to wait 30 min to get your dam order wat happen to fast food when you went and left 10 min later its crazy,0
Worst people ever. The girls were being rude for no reason. The zoo theme outside is very nice but the customer service was the worst. We asked a question and she slammed the window on us,0
Wow!!  Today I went through the drive thru.  The cashier freaked out when I presented a discount coupon.   The cashier told me the receipt printer was out of paper.  When I pulled forward to the food pickup window.  I informed them and requested my receipt.  It turns out the cashier was lying just hiding the fact I was charge double on my credit card.  I waited 7 additional minutes for my tiny order to be prepared.  I brought to their attention about the overcharge.  They said to call and they will take care of it over the phone.  I have been calling the entire day.  No answer.,0
"Awful experience. It was 10:15 and I needed a sweet tea and nuggets. I order my tea in the drive through line. The line was pretty long. When I got to the window to pay the cashier with light brown eyes, said they could only take cash. I said, what!!! I have stayed in this line this long and no one said a word!! I said, for my inconvenience I would like to have the tea. She looked strange, and I said please let me speak to your manager. She spoke to someone, and the manager said no and wouldn't come to the window. AWFUL!!!",0
"Zari was absolutely incompetent! We specifically ordered 4 meals to be placed in 4 separate bags during the first stage of ordering (as they were for 4 people). When we requested this again at her window, she rolled her eyes, huffed, and began changing them out. She also gave me 3 Cokes and 1 diet Coke (for the diabetic in the group). They didn't mark the diet Coke so she told us that it was the wrong one! Luckily there was no need for a hospital visit due to her total lack of concern for safety and health!",0
"Always something with this location. Either system down, only cash or sometimes no respond on the drive thru at nights",0
Well what can I say I use to work mc Donalds and their custermer  service  was great I went to drive through  tonight no one help me on the speaker so I drove  to the window the cashier tell no that will need to go back in line and order again that he could get my order at the window I was in line for good 10 15 mn then I go to  the window to talk to manger nothing and he just left to the back and ignored  the custermer in the front he was asking for him to get him something  he did not get any help he left I drove up then he was not there at all with a big line I went back to the drive thru and well to oder then he tel their is no ice scream so I get inline again for nothing had to stay in line until they served every one in front and again no one in the windows to help  but just the some  need to ck cause I have it all in video  I will posting it on line to she how horrible  custermer service  Mc Donald's  have compare to Chick-fil-A  they don't come close of the quality  and custermer service they have and people need to start speaking about  Mc how not only tge drive thru people wait for 20 to 30 mn some all the pollution but that's another story I hope this makes some ck this out,0
"Went today after the zoo, it was a very bad experience to say the least.
We were given over seasoned  fries, one straw for three drinks, and the drinks were all bad.
I thought how do you mess up a drink?
It is my belief that this was attributed to the mistake that was made with coffee order wanted moca frap was given hot coffee.
She took all drinks back and brought tray back with correction.
It tasted like instead of coffee mixture it was blended with old filtered out deposits, I mean really sour.
The manager however corrected the moca and recooked fries.
When we left a second time I tasted the unsweetened tea and Coke... It was horrible foul I thought omg I almost served this to my kids!!
Will not ever return.",0
"Doesn't deserve one star! Waited in line 30 minutes. When we finally ordered the girl couldn't get the order right after 3 attempts. When we got to the pay window, the girl was talking on her cell phone. When I asked her to repeat my order, she looked at me crazy. When we got our order it was disgusting. Soggy oily fries, burned chicken nuggets, water down soda ... plain disgusting. They need new management for sure!!! Someone please contact corporate!!!!!",0
These teenagers with bad customer service have the worst attitudes and are lazy. I bet the hiring manager is the same way considering her terrible hires. I wouldn give this place one star. The only good person I,0
I ordered a 6 piece nuggets and 3 chocolate chip cookies I got my nuggets and had to wait 15 minutes for the cookies I had to call and let them know I was still waiting in reserve 1,0
I was disappointed that the play area was closed due to it being filthy and the speakers were blown so the animal noises were bursts of LOUD static.,0
Worst experience ever. I pay for large fries and only fill it half way. I said if I want a medium I'll pay for a medium. Now fill this up or give me my money back. Service is just the worst I've seen. I really recommend people to not go there. Waste of time and will leave you with a headache,0
"Same ol"" ready in 2 minutes food. Idk how they do it . But ramen needs to step up their game because it takes longer to cook noodles in the microwave . Great Job Mickey D's",0
"My wife and I was going to this McDonald's for some morning when they had another crew. But here recently they changed the morning to a new crew(an old man, a young vanity lady at the drive through window that is very rude). This crew need to be removed. They never seemed to know how to work and prepare your order in a timely manner. This facility is also made where you can't just get out of line in the drive through which is very dangerous if a car stalls or a real emergency arrives. We will be skipping visiting the morning crew. Plz. change crew or train them better.",0
"Would have have it a negative if possible. I have went to this location for the last time. Drive through you will sit at the speaker for 2 minutes before they even say anything to you but you can hear them talking/laughing/and cursing to each other. POOR MANAGEMENT. THEN, my order was wrong so I go inside to get a refund only to see my receipt had about 15 streks of ink on it nothing legible. SO I go inside and say I would like my money back and the manager just shrugs me off like it doesn't effect her. If you are going to the Dallas Zoo drive further and don't let this McDonald's ruin your day. TRUST ME.",0
"Horrible place....rude employees, burnt fries, and fudge sundae had fudge all over top and outside of plastic top. .",0
"Be careful with young children here! We had a women approach our booth and asked personal questions about my young niece while my brother was getting the food. We tried to dismiss her and did not answer her questions, but she just sat herself in our booth uninvited. We asked her to leave several times, because it was very uncomfortable. She just continued to sit and stare at my neice. We made it clear we were having a private lunch and would like her to leave.
Then the women's boyfriend called her back to his table, she left us and then they walked out shortly after.
Another patron approached us after the women left our table because she believed the women was planning to abduct my niece. She noticed the women staring at my niece and told us to be safe. When we left they were parked next to our truck as well. We will definitely not be going back there.",0
Dirty! Dirty! Dirty! We saw previous customers coming back to get their orders fixed. Every table in the play place was awful. (Ours had spilled milk). The employee took one trash can out but didn pick up the trays and didn clean up the busted bbq sauce on the floor. What was also bad was that we moved to another table and the floor was covered with napk,0
Terrible for getting rid of the zoo decor.,0
"***Deserves No Stars What So Ever !***

This Place Is By Far The Worst! The drive threw lady  on 12/6/17 was absolutely rude! I came  to get some breakfast around 10:45 she continusly kept asking me"" is that it?"" I asked for a minute to see the menu. Then within a ""Second"" she asked if I was done with my order!  Sausage burritos had No Sausage. Orange Juice Cups Were Only Filled Half Way. Hash browns were cold ! By far the worst service ever! Your management needs to  work on their employees attitudes !",0
"Well it might have been ok, if I was not rushing, but I still stayed for my items. For this to be McDonald's, they should know that it's busier during certain hours then others..there were soo many ppl in line, the average person would have turn right back around n walked out.",0
The service could be better they always forget to give you condiments and napkins. Even after you've ask. Then soon as you drive away.  You have to come back and go inside and explain that you were lied to.,0
The employees are very rude one of them snatched a bag out of my boyfriends hands because they messed up our order and when we complained to the manager she laughed and did nothing about it. I would expect better seeing is how it,0
Their icecream machine was broke. They didnt have any toys for the happymeals. The tables were disgusting. And I counldnt understand the cashier. Plus she was using 2 registers at once!!!!! If i could give negative stars i would!,0
"This mc donalds is very slow and the employees are rude and always have an attitude when you ask to get your order fresh . I always count on this mc donalds not to mess up with my order but they ALWAYS do . Also they tell you to wait on the 1 or 2 waiting spot but never come out with your food . Today i ordered chicken nuggets and asked for them to be fresh , they were ok until i noticed that the chicken was BLACK inside one of the nuggets . Maybe was black inside of more of them and i didnt notice . I have picture proof as well . This mc donalds is just trash .",0
"Very Disappointed, 40 minutes to get my food due to short of staff per shift leader. No manager to get my money refunded. I've waited in the drive-thru. No apology whatsoever from that shift leader.  Will call coporate office myself.  My order was all screwed up.",0
"The drive thru took forever and it was 10p!! The young attendant felt the need to chat with the car in front of me for a full 7 mins. Doesn't sound ridiculous until you're sitting there watching it with a full line of impatient cars behind you. Then when I pulled up the kid realized he never handed back the guy's credit card, and started laughing about it. His co-worker was shaking her head saying ""it was cuz you got distracted talking to him about guns for so long"" ...
To add insult to injury, I got my food, I had to remind the kid about my drinks that I ordered, I left, and my food was cold and my order was wrong.",0
"Horrible service, I'm just done with McDonald's. I tried a few different locations and apparently none of them can offer a friendly service i will just take my money somewhere else.",0
"A worker called MY order number so obviously I'm gonna grab it. It didn't even occur to me to look at the tray the only thing I noticed was that I was missing a coffee so I set the tray on the table and on my way back I see the manager yelling at my family about how WE grabbed the wrong order and see at first we tried being cool about it. She said she was taking back the extra food and we said that was fine so then she starts grabbing the food we ordered and says we weren't charged for that, after an interesting conversation we establish that my receipt clearly said I was charged. Ten minutes later they've manned to give two BIG orders but haven't managed to give me a bacon egg mcgriddle. So eventually I get the burger and as the manager hands it to me she's telling a worker she gave us 8 hash browns. I obviously heard her and said ""no ma'am, we got 4"" this same manager then has the audacity to say we already ate them. At this point I'm pissed. I've been accused of not paying for my part of the food, I'm hungry, I've waited way too long, the manager has an attitude, AND she's a accusing my family of eating 4 hash browns in less than a minute. NEVER eating at this McDonald's again. Especially with a manager like that.",0
"I eat at this McDonalds at least 4 times a week. Never again. The service is always questionable and the drive thru order is screwed up as often as not. Had to wait at drive-thru order 5 full minutes before giving my order. That's at the speaker, not in line. Was told (rather rudely) to wait several times. When given the order, the server practically threw the bag at me and disappeared. When I got to work, I found I had to eat my hotcakes with no plasticware, no syrup or butter and not even a napkin. Calls placed to the store went unanswered. Poor service all around.",0
Burgers are always flat. Good for on the road food. I sure do miss the dollar menus tho. And they charge for mayo if you add it but not if you get packets.. humm,0
Worst experience ever!! They closed the lobby early!! Then the manager found out people were still coming in and started yelling!! The nice officer apologized for her attitude and gave us complimentary drinks for patiently waiting for our burger. She needs to go over a customer service training again or find another job!!,0
"9/3/18 @ 1:50pm I came by McDonalds today and I went through the drive through the girl that takes your order did not even bother to Greet me and take my order she was just talking so much I guess she did not know she was gossiping and knew we can hear her but she was saying the most rudest things through speaker, it seems like she was talking to another employer. I kept saying helloo hellooo helloo and did not even bother to stop talking. Then when I pulled up to the first window the one that was so rude was the one that has a ring in her nose she is african american she did not even bother to repeat my order and did not offer to give me receipt. There was another girl next to her biting off her Acrylic Nails and was falling all over the table where the order computer were at SO DISGUSTING! I used to work here things have changed and these ghetto girls are so RUDE! At the pick up window that lady was so sweet she had a smile and greated us well.",0
I am really surprised that McDonald refused service for food at 4:00 am when we were starving and reached there for food. The lady at the dr,0
Their ubereats need to be more attention to detail n packed nice not just thrown in always missing something i asked for bought the big breakfast meal and got sent no silverware no syrup nothing like Damn how am i going to eat this i even put a note in the app to add napkins and condiment n still can't receive it what's the point of leaving a note if no one reads it I've order different times and never fail to disappoint me,0
"So today.. 11-4-18 about 4:30 am. I stop at this McDonald's by the dallas zoo i order a bacon egg and cheese biscuit and a large drink, i get to the window and she says 8$ and some change,  i say FOR WHAT???  SHE SAY you ordered the combo, right.? I say NO JUST THE DRINK AND THE BISCUIT SANDWICH... SHE SAY ok..... And then she charge me 4$ and some change... So WTH was she charging me for.. She even say YEAH THOSE COMBOS ARE EXPENSIVE!! WITH A SE",0
Terrible service. 2 minutes off breakfast and wouldn't serve us anything. They had bad service took 20 minutes to get through drive through. Not fast food and quality was the worst mcdonald's I've ever had,0
DO NOT EAT AT THIS MCDONALD'S TILL THEY BRING THE ANIMALS BACK!!!!!!,0
"Staff was great, but cook are trash...
How can you screw up a simple burger? when you don't care that's how...",0
My order is always wrong. I was making my order in the drive through she ask me what I wanted to drink when I answer she we have no soda.smh,0
Disgusting food and terrible service. If your ever in the area make sure to right past this place. Dont even look it's way. You will get sick if you eat this garbage and I mean in the worse way. I wouldn't feed this stuff to animals. I wouldnt eat this stuff if I was starving. Horrible end of story,0
They forgot what people order.... I order 5 ice cream and they just give me one n they say that is everything.... Them i show them the receipt n i had to wait 10 more minutes for the order 4 cones they dont napkins.......,0
The employees cannot count for nothing. On top of that the coffee tasted like cardboard it's very obvious they do not clean their machines. Disgusting store.,0
Good food. I waited 15 minutes for one bacon cheeseburger. The store is very sloppy it look like a hurricane came through. They were understaffed. I deserve a free meal for that experience.,0
My family and I get to this McDonald's we are shocked it looked so nice from the outside and they have the jungle themed play house. I ask if they have an outlet so that I may charge my laptop and phone and no. The Wi-Fi here is not even strong enough. I could not complete my homework.  Bummed out.  Not the best as usual.,0
The customer service is just not what it used to be. There is no Welcome to McDonalds just how can i help. I ended up payimg for someone elses order. At 1st i thought it was more but it was 20 cents less. I'm glad i only go there for drinks.,0
The service was alful everyone working the front was either on there phone or joking around. They got my order wrong twice. New management is needed and a whole new crew to go with it.,0
"Stopped to grab some food and go to the restroom. RESTROOM WAS SO nasty ,with wet stuff all over the floor, no toilet paper and toilets were nasty.We walked out of the restroom, I told hubby no tissue paper .He said let's go this whole place is nasty. Trash can was overflowing around the floor ,all tables dirty and and no jungle sounds coming from the animals .. Disgusting.  THEY only had 2 families sitting in  the dinning room and 2 families in line ..",0
"I was just at the drive thru, my son wanted some breakfast number 13 and the girl just kept on saying, no maam, no maam, what the hell you mean no maam.....well she said that is not a breakfast,  uuuhhhhh yes it is, well she decided to tell me to wait, well I'm already mad because she doesn't tell me why can't I get it and to top it of she's taking her time, I just told her to forget it and she says, well ok,,,,,I had to stop at the window and ask her what she meant, ,,,oh lord ....she talked to me like I'm stupid or dumb,,,,,she's like well we only have that...and points to a sign on the window with the all day breakfast menu, if she would of explain that through the speaker. ...I wouldn't be complaining now, so I told her she should of explained that to me, she told me ""oh well"", si ,  left, and  here I am at Jack in the box enjoying breakfast with my boys,,,,no issues and great customer service. .....one thing for sure I will be doing, is telling my family and friends not to go there,,,,,,",0
"You can't pay me to eat there. I heard about that food online. Try the meat at home
and french fries leave it out for two weeks and it never turn bad. What the hell is in that food. Everything look good...ain't good for you.",0
"Today June 22, 2017 at 21:05 aka 8:25 my order was taking in drive thru I ask for Double chesse burger with no oins and no pickles with large sweet tea extra ice add lemon. So my drink had no extra ice or lemon and frys I drive home to eat my food which I stay 22 mints away from store it by my school... I get hone to open my bag to have only receive Hot & Spicey and no Fry's which was not my order and young lady at both windows ready my order back. I have called the store 8 times to speak with manager and nobody has pick up the phone",0
Manager at this establishment is very disrespectful and doesn't want to do her job. Do to the fact of this the line was held up for over 30 minutes. Wouldn't recommend this McDonald's to anyone,0
This location needs serious rehabbing. Only drive thru service. The line was wrapped around building and onto the street. My food was cold fries old n refried burned...smh... NEVA AGAIN,0
Let me put it this way... GETTO. Most of the employees are on the phone and acting like they are at the park. Need to be more Profesional and get this place more clean. Frys taste like old oil. Macdonald fix this place please! The place is nice just need to work on your employees.,0
"I want to add a small fry at the window after I ordered at the speaker n the black lady   refused to add, and I'm asking for the manager and she said I can't  because you ordered is ready... she was black and  without uniform how the MANAGER  come to the window n tell me she can't... 05/25/19 in the  afternoon",0
I like that it is animal theme and has a playground but the cashiers are rude and they can't get your order right so they get mad when you tell them you are missing something. Also they are dirty.,0
"Stopped by for a quick grab on my way home.
Got my burger wrong but the drive through line was too long so I feed it to the birds. (10:30pm)",0
"Horrible, First my nephews cheeseburger, The bun was to hard to cut through then the burger patty was old. I know bad buns and burgers, Ive worked at a McDonald's. Second was my Mcflurry, I ordered the oreo Mcflurry. She put the oreos on the top and didnt mix then in and when i asked her to mix it. She said ""We dont do that."" BUT THE MCFLURRY MACHINE WAS BEHIND HER?!? Then she rolled her eyes at me! NEVER GOING HER AGAIN! HORRIBLE SERVICE! HORRIBLE FOOD!",0
Worst experience ever. Customer service is the worst in this location. The staff working 6/16/19 at 3:00am is the worst. The messed up the orders and didn,0
I was just there this morning; to order a couple meals to go ; the word is TO GO right? Okay so we order and tell me why my food was wrong and I didn't get my iced coffee ?And when the cashier asked if it were for here or to go; I said to go. Hmm they always mess up orders and nevertheless get them right; the floors are always sticky and dirty as well some tables no where to really sit. Bad to come here,0
"I went this week end with my kids the indoor play ground smells like a mens gym
the temperature was warm inside there for the activity needs to be cooler. The outside ketchup dispensers don't work and the servers get upset when you ask for more ketchup or sauces. If I order a 20pc chicken nugget and 4 med fries I will need more than 2 bbq sauce and 4 packages of ketchup. Plus a Vagrant was hitting people up for money inside the restaurant. Not going back ever again you guys need to clean up that place",0
"I had to ask for every single little thing.  Ie: napkins,  catsup,  spoons for the sundays,  peanuts,  extra peanuts. My receipt. Clearly she didn't want to be at work.  SMH. 0 RATING.",0
Did not provide a receipt and didn't give us the chocolate milk in happy meal! Rude service. Shame on this location ,0
Terrible food and terrible service. While waiting at the window someone started yelling at the employee in which he stopped to yell back and call her a bit** and tell her that someone named bebe won't be in till 5. Highly inappropriate and I felt I should have drove off which would have been the better decision. No one should ever go here and they should rethink the staff,0
Doesn't deserve a single star. My burger was slopply made and half sticking out of the box. Way to much pepper poured on the chicken and gave us a drink instead of a shake that I ordered. By far the worse mcdonalds in Texas area. Would never come back and rather drive out of Dallas to order my food at another Mcdonalds.,0
"Every time I come here they never get the order right, and if they do they never give the correct sauce. It don",0
Probably the worst McDonald,0
"The people from the night shift they are so very rude ! I pass tru last nite and i try to buy a burger the manager told me on the speaker i em not ready yet  WTF , it was only me on the drive tru , the i wen araund and she was talking to her boyfriend on a black chalenger selling drugs and smoking weed they sell DRUGS TRU THE NITE OMG !!!!",0
Horrible customer service. I ordered waited 5 min at the window and ask me 3 time what my order was. Then was told to pull up and waited 8 more min and  no one came out. So I went inside and they forgot about my order.,0
"Awful. Just awful. 1030 at night, waited 20 minutes in drive through, finally got to window (after being harassed by homeless people) and told manager I didn't think I should have to pay for food after waiting 20 minutes. All I got was a bunch of children that gave me grief. Unacceptable.",0
"I came there with a fiend and we were told a price for our total, and after I arrived at the window the lady charged me another $5 dollars. Really? I did pay them, but come on.",0
Always great to go there but they need to work on giving food or right to there customers several cases of not handing me the right stuff,0
Theme has been removed...,0
Leave Don Sp,0
"A mess all trash overflowing cashier more worried about who didn't come to work . I expected better from this md,s by the zoo. Clean up people.",0
Horrible .. received a cheese burger with literally 7 slices of cheese on it. When we came back to change it we sat in the drive thru for 5 minutes while the cashier talked to her friend in the drive thru.,0
"Cashier and staff made us feel very unwelcome. Unfriendly staff. Very rude and disrespectful. Needless to say, we didnt stay.",0
I had to wait 15 minutes for a Happy Meal and Mc Chicken sandwich. The person bringing your order had  no mask on.,0
They just put the fries back in the oil so you think there.fresh and fries didnt even had salt also the fries had alot of oil and the meat was not fresh the buns were hard   I try to call back and they never answer the phone these happen in the night shift,0
Cancelled my order today due to the fact this location doesn't serve water. Cancelled my family's order. How can I wash this greasy food down if cant even buy water here. Blows my mind,0
"Same as Jack in the Box, they mess up your order because they can't hear out of those stupid headsets, then there's another charge, & more wait time.",0
This place customer service is TRASSSSSH throw the whole McDonald's away NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! By the way I HAD TO ADD A 占쏙,0
These people are slow as hell. I waited for 20 minutes for some yogurt. 20 minutes!! Don't come here until they hire better people,0
Kids love McDonald's but when people making drug deals in the parking lot there is an issue.,0
The very poor and unsatisfactory customer service reflects the equally subpar food products being sold here. I pray to see the day this franchise leaves this earth like the black plague.,0
Past service has been good until recently went in stood for about three minutes at the counter while olga laughed and giggled it took a person from the back to ask me did I need help  and take my order and no it was not busy,0
"Food was cold as their heart. And the classic, they forgot to add the barbecue!",0
I ordered a caramel machiatto and it tasted really spoiled. Last time I will be visiting here.,0
Until they do the upgrades at this store in this area just throw the whole store away.  The entire crew needs training just to fix a mocha coffee sad real sad.,0
No one should have to wait more than 20 minutes in a drive-thru lane at a fast food restaurant for their order.,0
"Dirty,service so Slow,Only Odered a shake,friends ordered to eat here a very large order & it was served to go,Cashier rigging her nose,sniffiling",0
"Poor customer service skills, consistently mess up orders. We drive 4 miles further to a better location more often than not.",0
"It was  very bad. In the wrong side of the neighborhood  .  Road was all messed up .
Employees were very dis respectful",0
Can't even give it a star it was nazty service sucked too many things just going wrong all at once decided to go else where ooooh and who in the hell has a bday party at the McDonald's at the zoo really I know ,0
There were no cars in front of me and it took over ten minutes for them to take my order. I would have left if I hadn't had a starving 5 year old with me.,0
Restaurant very dirty trashcans were full the whole hour I was there. No one even wiped down a table. Sad to see there is no pride in anything.,0
this is my second time going through drive thru in the same person gave me my food with an attitude if u do not like your job dont work. on 3-29-2019 07:30pm,0
I used to not have issues with the location I went to last night but in recent months they have been giving me the wrong order or not giving me my whole order amd when I went last night the night employees came off like they hated their job and didnt care about customers,0
BRING BACK THE ANIMALS,0
Roaches in this place. They have totally let it get run down. Hope you enjoy your McRoaches,0
They don't know the definition of costumer service.  Wrong order twice on 1 day.  They respond so rude . Horrible experience avoid this place,0
My fries were cold (thats all I ordered) and took 14 minutes.,0
No wifi,0
"Customer service is bad, they were super slow. They did not complete my order and when I asked them for the rest of the stuff, no apology when they handed it to me.",0
WHY DID THEY REMODEL THIS GEM,0
"This manager tru me out.
Siad a was not welcome n his store just cus o told they need open at 5 am",0
better than most.but the burger meat was cold fries was hot and good tho,0
Beware they walk away with to the back with your bank. They not suppose to do that. I went off on the cashier. I will be calling up there to speak with a manager,0
We are relying on the workers to take the orders correctly.  Thanks for coffe with no cream or equal.,0
"Worst McDonald's food ever. Mcchicken was so dried out I couldn't even eat it, the service was terrible and the guy at the window was rude and was cussing with employees while we were at the window. Smh",0
Went in late visiting from out of state thinking lobby was open since door was open and manager acted like we broke in and threatened to call cops if we didnt immedietly leave. Very rude,0
Went to order something to go .. I get it that there a long line that,0
Depends on the worker that you get can either be really nice or really rude! What can you expect from McDonalds in oak cliff?!,0
I saw them hand mixing a shake and my Mcflurry wasnt even mixed. Best thing here are the animal sculptures.,0
Just a rude staff who seem to have a bad attitude.  Order was correct and fine just rude people.,0
By far one of the dirtiest McDonald's I've ever been to. 10 dirty tables the entire time we were there. No hand sanitizer...,0
No electric outlets to charge phones!!!!  This McDonald location is falling back hard. The staff have very poor work ethics. Tattoos and lack of respect are prominent here.,0
Over run with pan handlers and drug users. I didn't even feel safe in drive thru.,0
Fries were hard and cold tasted like they were from the bottom of the pan and nuggets were old and nasty. Never will go here again!,0
Slow service and the food was wrong not once but twice. Complete waste of time and money,0
"Very bad customer service, i didn't even get a thank you. They  made me way long time for my order",0
Food was terrible. My friend and I both threw up after a few bites.  Ordered a coke and got a dr pepper,0
"They always get my order wrong, either they don't give me something ,or they give me the wrong thing.",0
Bad service. Very dirty. Bums are everywhere  begging for something. And did i mention very dirty? I'd go somewhere else next time.,0
I asked for a side of Big Mac sauce a did not receive any also I ask for large fries and got a small instead and to top if they assumed I spoke Spanish how rude!!,0
They was loud and had attudes and hanging all out the window my food was cold this was a bad place to eat at,0
"Sign said dining room open, but doors were locked.",0
Service was bad waited a long time for my food and coffee. Then they gave me the wrong coffee,0
They messed up my order and did not want to fix it,0
It would be nice place if you could enjoy your meal without people asking for money the whole time,0
Never get your order right!! And when let them know they got your order wrong... They get mad smh,0
Service was very slow. 10 minutes for 1 egg mcmuffin. No apologies for the long delay.,0
The person taking our order took forever to get on the speaker because the crew were all inside playing around.He was rude on the speaker as they continued to play and laugh.,0
Rude!!!!.....and they gave me the wrong order.,0
Stop by here February 16 in the morning at 6:00 am I waited 20 minutes and they gave me the wrong order in the end they have no service and I asked for sauces for my food and they didn't have what kind of store is this,0
Check you food good because my wife had chewed into a frie that she thought was burnt but no she spot it out and we checked it out who knows what it was but it smelled really really bad and tasted nasty my wife said,0
Pure attitude from young lady at window.  Not a place I will go to ever again.,0
"This McDonald's is slow and they're always messing up your order..you go through the drive for fast service, only to have to wait 10 to 15 minutes for your food...AFTER you've already waited 10 minutes in line to pay..its ridiculous..",0
My husband found a LONG black hair as he was chewing a piece of his big mac.,0
"They keep serving stale food and when you request fresh food, they put your food in the microwave and reheat your fries, I saw it with my own eyes.",0
"This is the worst McDonald's I've ever been to how there still open I don't know the employee at the drive thru was rude, buns were hard, I was missing two burgers out of the order, the nuggets were cold they tasted like they were old if I could give them a big fat 0 I would very disappointed with this restaurant...",0
Got hit up by a beggar with 30 seconds of parking.  Beggar then proceeded to move inside to converse with employees.,0
Girl at the counter much rather text than take orders. Then told me to mind my own business.,0
Night crew really sucks I had to go around twice to get my order correct and when confronted they want to get a attitude like it's my fault they work there smh,0
Worst macdonald  in the world. There are people asking for money in there which is very ,0
Very crappy place they have me waiting 15 minutes for a cup of coffee finally I reminded him and they had forgot that I was waiting for it crappy place bad service,0
This is the worst mcdonalds ever!!! There is always something wrong or out of stock. And the customer service is the worst. employees always look mad and never greet or smile.,0

I went here 3/23 around 9:30pm and there were 3 women working that I witnessed making racial slurs against a Black man. It was incredibly upsetting and uncalled for폠 understand the best of the best aren,0
I order through Uber Eats often. Every single time I order Chicken nuggets they Always forget to put the Barbeque Sauce I Requested in the bag. Always!! It's not nice. It's not ok. I order 40 Nuggets. 40 and not one Sauce in the bag. This has happened too many times. I'm sick of it. Today they also forgot to send an item I paid for. I'm done with this location.,0
"I came today at this store at 9pm and the person in charge scream from a table to us. That it was closed (a lady with red curly hair) i  didnt said anything to her and when to the computer because people was ordering, when she came to us; she said again it was closed, i told her it said outside and in the page that this store close at 11pm. She said in a rude way: if you order your food will not be prepared. And she closed the computer. I didnt said anything to that woman, because im not wasting my time and energy with  people as rude like that.

It's McDonald's so I don't expect much if anything but the people running this one don't have a care in the world. Staff walking around in the back wearing scruffy old pyjamas looking street wear. (ie not the uniform and not even clean looking personal clothes) No hairnets. Kiosks not working. Slow service at the counter and long wait for food. Missing items. I could go on.,0
"The worst McDonald I have ever been to! First we waited in one of the drive through lane for over 15 minutes just to find out it was out our order. No signs and no one notifying the customers. The other lane was long so I parked and ordered online for curbside pick up. After waiting for a while, no one deliver my food so went inside believing maybe they were short staffed but the employees were chatting and wondering around. order.
Even more disappointing, fries were cold and soggy. What happened to the tomato, lettuce and mayo in ",0
I can't believe how many times they ask me if I wanted cheese on my double CHEESEburger I ask for it only ketchup n onions I'm surprised they didn't ask me if I wanted the meat as well. SMH,0
"Worst McDonald's I've ever been to. On Friday, February 17th, it was closed at 9:41pm. Wth? Really? Couldn't believe it. Staff that turned me away wasn't very polite either. What is this? Chucky cheese or something? Although I think even they stay open longer than that, Friday night c'mon. I hope someone from corporate will read this, might as well shut this dump down if you're gonna close around 9 on weekends",0
Slowest fast food restaurant I퐒e ever gone to. I,0
I went today to get food and they said two times they were not open. It clearly states they are open 24 hours. I asked nicely twice why they were closed and all I got was we are closed. Not professional at all and not right. I understand things happen but why no answer back? But the whole place is lit up. Just give me an answer.,0
"Came here at 4 in the morning and they told me they are closed, but right before I drove up to the window there was another guy Infront of me that they served. Something else funny has happened at this McDonald's before! I went there in person to get a milkshake but they told me they don't have it, when I got home I went on Uber eats and ordered a milkshake from that same McDonald's XD. LOL",0
"For workers like her big companies' name are ashamed.

What a horrific experience I just had;  this lady you see in the picture for telling her she was giving me a wrong item and not the one I paid for she started a big drama and spilt my son's smoothie and started singing a vulgar song/lyrics as per offending me through that and not directly addressed to me. All that in front of the manager ..

Besides that waiting time was ridiculous long with a lot of customers not satisfied and even a uber eats guy had to cancel in front of  me because they didn't make his order in more than 20 min that I was there ...

Another lady in the back was not using the yellow paper that sandwiches have she was placing the  buns/bread directly on the table as she was preparing food for dogs. She saw me and start acting like nothing happened..

This place is a completely mess

JUST STAY AWAY",0
We spent more than half an hour in the drive through. One person is doing all the work. The ice cream machine is not working as well as the milk shake :(,0
Got me waiting for to long to take my order,0

TERRIBLE service they took 10 minutes to take my order when no one was in line. Then in the next lane someone pulled up had waited 5 seconds before someone took their order before me who had be been waiting. They charged me the wrong food and never got my correct receipt. Next window they lost my order and then got it wrong after I said very clearly what i wanted and it wasn't a complicated order just two burgers.,0
"This is by far THE worst McDonalds I have ever been too. They  consistently deliver poorly McDonald service and food  menu item.
They poorly assemble burgers , chicken  sandwiches etc as it always their team members do not care on how McDonald standards are taken.
Please",0
"I rarely eat at mcdonalds but for convenience and the 40 min drive I had to take home I decided to give it a shot, it was 10:20 pm and went to the drive thru, the lady told me that ""they were not going to take orders until 11 p.m"" but it says 24 hrs isn't it? While I gave the round about I saw all the staff just sitting and chilling in the dining area... look I understand it's not the best job, but at least try... anyway do not try to go between 10-11 pm because you are not going to be attended",0

Depressing & very sad memorial evidencing what happened during the Holocaust period!,0
Worst mcdonald's ever this morning I went inside no cashier they told me to use kiosk to order my food. I ordered and then had to wait 30 minutes this was so crazy and then I asked to speak with a manager and then I had to wait about another 15 min and then no staff members would speak English. They all need an attitude adjustment. I will never ever go to this Mcdonald's again never ever had to wait 45 min for a cup of coffee!!!! Please don't go and spend your money here!!!,0
This place needs more attention and better management employees only do is play around flirt with each other and scream too much and the also have no hat or any hair net on the kitchen staff the only person I saw with a hair net is the cleaning lady,0
"I ordered takeout from the McDonald's app. After waiting at least 20 minutes they finally talked to me and asked about my order. I said that I put my order in through the app. They said that because their system was down they could not give me the food that I paid for. I spent ten dollars and wasted a half hour of my life. I have had to complain to corporate, I have had to talk to a manager via email. Nothing has been done, they don't even want to give me a refund they merely offered me a coupon which they never gave me. It has been months since this had happened and there is still no resolution. If I left a McDonald's with ten dollars worth of food they would have me arrested but because I am a customer they are fine with stealing my money and my time. This is a terrible McDonald's and because of this experience I will no longer be going to any McDonald's in the future.",0
"I love McDonald, so I going to eat my BigMac combo, very good! But the big problem is, very very dirt, dirty tables, dirt coming out of garbage cans, dirt on the ground!  I made a video and now I send it directly to McDonald Company!!! I talk with the manager!!",0

New remodel makes it way more closed off and industrial and cold. You get wet sitting under a/c vent. Printer didn,0
Id give it zero starts if I could. The drive through only had two cars ahead of me to order and in total it took an hour. It took ten minutes no exaggeration at the order board for someone to take my order. When i get to the window he didnt know what i had and literally just then put my order in. It was not that busy at all and it had at least 4 people working. At the window he took my card for about two minutes and i froze my bank account just in case,0
"Just horribly slow! Waited 10 minutes to get to the order screen at the drive thru, even though only two cars ahead of us in the right lane. It took another 40 minutes to get my kid's food. It really makes no sense",0
I ordered a medium vanilla latte hot I got a large cup of ice cream. To completely  different items so how did they screw up my order. Coffee not ice cream it's really sad,0
"This mcdonalds is wayyy to disorganized and they take forever to attend you. Yea, they are friendly but honestly waited to long just to get the order wrong.",0
"The general manager of this location had the worst customer service I have ever experience! I order food , it was cold.

I have been in line for an hour to get 2 Quarter pounders meals. What ever happened to FAST FOOD? This is ridiculous. I have a starving child at home.,0
Customer service was terrible! After waiting five minutes just to try and place our order we decided just to drive up to the window to place our order. Once we got to the window the young lady that was suppose to be taking orders for the drive thru was just on her phone texting. The sense of urgency was nonexistent! All we wanted was a large fries and sweet tea ,0
"They are always late in their orders
I was there today 10/02/22 with my family and my food were done 40min late
They need more management",0
The worst McDonald i came across. Just takes them mire than 20 minutes from order to receive. Hope the building burns down.,0
Was basically out of half the menu. Then we had them repeat back our $56 dollar order to us twice and once we got back to our hotel 2 sandwiches were missing. While paying with my card through the drive thru the cashier said I had to give her my pin number because the pad didn't reach out the window. I've NEVER had something like that happen to me anywhere in my life. Not a single employee had on a uniform. Just a total messed up experience,0
We wait in the line for over 20 min. When we arrive 2 employees were outside the store speaking. The worst drive thru service ever!,0
"Every, time, I, come, here... EVERY TIME!! I don't think I've been able to ever successfully pick up an order from here.. like ever. They either don't have the order, or my pickup gets cancelled because of the wait time... Smh",0
"If you like to have your order messed up, having people mumbling at you, and don care about getting any sauce with your nuggets this place is for you. The crack heads hanging out in the drive through is also a nice touch, although based on my experience those might just be workers on their break. Oh and the fries ... so old and stale they would make a great ",0
"Terrible. In line for over an hour and my whole order was messed up. First they told me over the drive thru intercom that they don't do the coupon on the app then told me to pull around after taking my order. Make matters worse was the one worker kept scratching her hair, her hoody on her head, then take it off and scratch hair again. Not once did she wash her hands, but had the nerve to be mad at me because your coworker didn't ring up the order correctly. Definitely will not be coming back to this one. I'm glad I'm on my way back home to Texas, so I can get some Southern Hospitality.",0
"Not 24 hours, more so when I feel like working especially late night. They sit inside and let a line build up and don't respond to multiple hellos. I don't get it. Customer service does not exist",0
"I never leave reviews but I had to here.

Honestly, if you visited every single McDonalds in the country and ranked them I am convinced this one would be dead last.

I spent an hour in the drive-thru and when I got to the window it took 10 minutes before anyone even came to the window and when they did they had no idea what I had ordered.

I have never seen a group of people move so slowly and with such little purpose or interest  in what they were doing. It seems like they were just annoyed to be working at all. Literally it looked like the whole crew was moving in slow motion, it was a sight to see.

Then when I finally did get my food the order it was, of course, not correct. But the weird thing is they didn short me they gave me an extra quarter pounder and fries.

I am just visiting and will never go there again anyways but ",0
"DO NOT GO! As soon as I got in, I got yell at by one of their employees to get out and go to through the drive thru. I told her I did not have a car and she told me to wait in the line anyways. I standed in the line for cars and they took forever to make any orders. After  my order was done, they made me wait on the sidewalk and let other cars go ahead of me just because I was not in a car. The two cars behind me had bigger orders (I am talking 2/3 delivery bags). They yelled at me, they basically threw the food at me and I left with the worst experience. Is not fast food if you have to wait 30 minutes just to order.",0
They never have anything - Their Menu is always crossed out and when you order something,0
Second time in less than 2.weeks apart. More than 20 minutes waiting in the drive thru because these guys take the wrong orders. A complete disaster.,0
"I move close to this unit, ordered via app to avoid the drive thru line, but for my surprise when I went to get my order that was ready I was forced to take an hour in the drive thru line.

This is supposed to be fast food.

When I went to pick up my order, the drinks were wrong, the potatoes were the wrong size and old, the Sundae machine was broken, they didn't deliver our sundaes and the attendance was super rude, saying that the problem was mine and not hers, burgers were in the correct Double Quarter Ponder box but when we got home, there were cheeseburgers and the third burger wasn in the bag!!

The amount charged on my card by the Mc Donald app was greater than the closing of the order.

I made a complaint to customer service that notified the unit but unfortunately no concrete action will be taken.

Never had a more disappointed experience estaurant again!",0
"Awful service they had ran out of everything so we had to order 5 quarter pounders, two large fries and 2 reg cokes?the sodas were mixed with diet and something else and the quarter pounders were made with three hamburger meets and they were stuffed with Mayo and like 20 pickles?disgusting

They made a mess out of the order it was late and somehow 34 dollars later all all we had were three cups of water and one quarter pounder. When I asked to. Speak to the manager the youn",0
"Food was fresh and fast, however the lady working at the drive through window was rude and nasty beyond belief. Her disgusting long fake curly weave was not put up and she kept flinging it around as we watched it dip into many of the drinks. She was too busy putting on lip gloss and rolling around a fat piece of gum him her mouth. Very rude at the window and impolite to her manager. Health department would have a field day with this Sorry excuse for a worker.",0
They need to shut down this Mc Donald or sell it to a different management. Worst service ever!,0
"The young ladies that work during the day are too busy chit chatting and texting and making the coffees wrong. Cashier at the drive thru window literally handed me my receipt with her head down and other hand texting. Very irritated that I paid for two coffees and it wasn't until I reached my next destination that I realized that they were made completely wrong. Ladies making the coffee were talking and laughing and didn't say hello, or thank you. Very rude.",0
"Update: updating to 1 stars. Was at the drive through for over 20 mins today. Cars were leaving the line bc it wasn moving. Got on the 2 lane and no one came to the speaker. I left.

Customer Service is terrible. Starting from when you get to the ordering screen. Drive-thru employees never greet you, never thank you, they look  tired and moody. There is one or two exceptions, I did look at the name badge because I was surpri",0
"Disgusting as always , I think they pre make the burgers a day ahead , the bread cheese and the patty is old , fries fells still frozen lol or they wish to be frozen",0
Terrible. Consistently understaffed. Just waited 45 minutes at drive thru. Food is disgusting,0
"Ordered a large iced coffee w/cream and sugar and an order of hot cakes.
Received a medium iced coffee with no sugar. And an old pancakes that are basically rubber. And to top it off no syrup, no butter, and a spoon to eat pancakes. Definitely wouldn recommend this location. It",0
Service is slow.  The neighborhood is so bad they have security in the lobby.  A person has to wonder just how safe is it to stop and dine here.  Lock your car.  Leave nothing if value in view.  Broken window glass in the parking lot,0
"Do NOT go to this McDonald's if you're in a hurry. We were just picking up a drink so it wasn't a problem but ordering was chaos and there was a guy beside us who had seriously been waiting 35 min for his chicken sandwich. He showed us the receipt showing when he ordered and was trying to ask the staff what was happening and they were quite rude and just said ""man you can see we busy"". Also note that this was the only McDonald's we encountered in Florida that doesn't offer $1 any size soft drinks.",0
"Staff are busy talking and they don't care about customers . And, they make us wait for long time at drive through all the time!
When I called at the store, they picked up the call. But when I start complain about this situations, they hung up on my face!  This McDonald used to be so good and professional.
I don't know what happened.
since they changed to new staff, got worse .",0
"Homeless people walking on  the restaurant, asking for money. Employees ignore it...",0
"Drive thru cashier completely got my order wrong.  She order what she saw on register and not what I wanted.  Then look surprised when I told her.  The manager should not let her work drive thru. Which explains why the line was so long.  I'm sure I'm not the only order she screwed up. Don't normally post these comments,  but it's becoming more of the norm these days.",0
"This McDonald's needs to close. I've ordered 15 times in 6 months and had 1 correct order. Don't order delivery, go yourself, and check the bag before you leave.",0
no stars!!! this is the worst ever service i have ever encountered 28 minutes in the drive-thru. I asked for a refund and the managers name and they refunded me my money and decline to give me the food. I ask the manager for her name and she walks away.... at the end i got my food for free but perhaps a better management team needs to come in and train cus these young women that were there yesterday 6/23 around 2pm were exchanging snapchat videos and chitchatting like they didnt have 8-10 cars in the drive thru,0
Bad costomer service slow workers,0
They have the worst manger ever. One of them have a lack of speaking which is Arlene Ledesma!!!!! She doesn't know what is being said to her. You can't get your point across because she won't understand . Can't handle the  customers and she's very disrespectful.,0
"the slowest mc Donalds in the world!  It is supposed to be 24 hours, but they leave it closed to customers and by car mac it takes 15 minutes per customer.  I mean I wasted 1h of my life waiting for such a bad and slow service",0
more than two hours waiting and I left without the order rude and drugged staff did not even know what they were doing,0

The worst person in the world taking orders at the window 12 16 18 at 7:48am with red yarn braids very nasty disposition rude and verbally abusive when I ordered I was cut off no repeat of order no price given so I went to the second window no one was in the first the person was full filing the order with HUGE attitude I stated that no attitude was necessary she proceeded to bark at me as though she was ready to fight me with the whole neck action and more attitude......I will not go back to this location its the second time in 1 week that Ive been there to such treatment. I can not believe that the mngr allows this behavior this can not be the first issue with this person nor can this behavior not be unnoticed......,0
"Almost everything I order was wrong. I order a Sunday with chocolate syrup, and they brought me caramel. I also order and paid extra for bbq sauce, and they didn't put any; the food was also cold!  Worst restaurant!",0
Warning- Check your order every time you come to this location. Guaranteed to be missing an item you ordered. Don let them tell you,0
Cant hate on the workers... its Mcdonalds... just dont go to this location. And good luck trying the drive thru if you have plans in the next 2 hours,0
"They won't mess up your order, but you will sit in the drive through for at least 15 - 20 minutes before you get to order and then wait another 10 minutes to get your food. Overall unless it's your only option, you should drive on to a better run McDonalds.",0
The new order system that takes the food to the table was not working .employees are very disorganized. Talking instead of doing their jobs  my coke spilled because it was poorly lid. I had a terrible experience at this location,0
Worst experience ever stood in line for 10 minutes to order asked when my order would be taken was told the system was down and was given a nasty attitude instead of proper customer service I was treated rudely bad enough the store was filthy fries everywhere on the floor the manager and the young lady was playing around with each other he tickling her on her side instead of fixing the solution I,0
"Avoid this location at night. It's the worst! First the whole staff hates thier jobs and second the wait time for your food is like 30 mins or more, between them doing your order and all the uber eats, postmates and grubhub also waiting to pick up orders. Its a mess. They are understaffed and everything is wrong at this location.",0
"I like the new design but the customer service has gone down hill. Way too many employees go there on their day off to socialize, they hang around the registers distracting emplyees who should be focused on their stations and tending to customers. The worst part is that one of the managers (a young latino kid) was engaged in of these conversations. I asked the manager why he wasn't controlling his staff and he just looked at me and laughed.",0
Never again clueless manager with no management skills or understanding that you aid where your employees lack because she just stood there during the holdup. Never again,0
"What a joke! Parking is awkward, went and asked for breakfast - they were out of muffins. Okay... asked me to wait a few minutes they'll start lunch at 10:30. Come up there at 10:30 on the dot - they tell me they won't serve lunch until 10:45-10:50, because they still have breakfast food left???? I didn't know the cashier's decide when to serve lunch now!",0
"I placed my mobile order, they made me wait 30 minutes in the drive thru before I could get my food, this is a dump! Always a $h!t show there!",0
The worst experience.  Staff and management ignored the customers. Talked to each other.  Took 10 minutes to order.  Then 10 minutes to get my food.  No apology.  Management watched and said nothing during this whole ordeal.  Total rude and unprofessional.,0
"This is the worst Mc. Donalds that I have ever visited. Sadly, this is the only one which is near my home and sometimes I don't have options to chose another one but, today, was the last straw. I made an order through the app and selected the pickup at the Drive Thru but when I got to the screen where we should order, the girl who was there didn't know what to do with my Order Code and when I got to the window and ask for it they didnt know anything neither and they pretended that I went inside because they do not dispatch mobile order by there. Also told me that the payment had not come through and I requested to cancel the order but, 3 minutes later I was charged with the order that I never got so, Im  making this complain because I am pretty upset and disappointed because I always eat in Mc. Donalds but in this store is always the same disgusting and poor service at all time or unless when I have gone: mornings and nights. Also, I disputed the charge you made to my credit card because, as you noticed, I never got it.",0
Went late one night to the drive thru and was told they were closed. I pulled forward and someone was paying for their meal. I thought this was a 24/7 location.,0
"If I could give 0 stars, I would.
Food: not fresh, not the right configuration
Staff: dude handed me an oreo Mcflurry without making sure the cap was on properly and it went all over my car. Asked for a manager and he said there was none.... ok dude, if you say so.
Drive-thru menu: half the screen was off and the drive thru lady could not comprehend that - even as I pulled into the store and told her. She didn't get what was happening.

I can't believe McDonald's would let a franchisee get away with this location's issues.",0
They couldn't even put the cheese on my sandwich properly. Terrible.,0

"I'll never come back to this McDonald's again. Went by for lunch & when I asked for a refill on my tea when leaving, I was informed that because I didn't buy a combo meal I couldn't get a drink refill. I guess the sandwich I bought didn't count. Tables were dirty too. Their not worth 1 star!",0
"this cashier treats us very badly, nasty attitude he should not work here,",0
"Used drive thru at 12,15 am; finally got my food at 12,45 am. They have two lanes for offering and only one window to dispatch food for those, plus the uber drivers on foot at the window waiting for their orders.

Food was kind of cold, fries and breaded chicken tasted like burned oil and on top of that, they didn't put any mayonnaise or ketchup for the fries.

These big chains have no quality control.
It's actually sad when you compare the food from the picture to what you really get.",0
Extremely slow service.,0
Slow service manager working register and takeout not enough help.,0
Worse service ever!,0
Both bathrooms are locked and not functional. No one in the store speaks English.,0
"I have had two bad experiences  with this particular  location , cashiers at drive thru dnt greet customers , and we waited for like five minutes for someone to come back to take our  order , we were told it wasn't any ice cream , but when we came inside there was a customer leaving with ice cream . That's when one of the employees said  quote on quote why yall played  like that . Both incidents ms Taylor whose suppose to be manager could not control her staff , neither could she tell me who was in the drive thru taking my order.  She has no control over that staff !! And clearly does not know how to run her shift!!! Horrible horrible experience when ppl are spending money at this location You guys really need better staff and managers who can run their shifts and not let the employees run over them because clearly that's what's going on at this location  I have reached out to cooperate  once and until this  is solved I'll keep reaching out !!!!",0

"Be aware of cashier at drive thrue not providing costumer with card  receipt , charging in excess.",0
This location takes cash only. No cards accepted.,0
"If you want to stand in front of the register for half an hour and be ignored and end up not ordering, this is the place for you.",0
"The manager the works , black her, in the morning thinks that treating bad people is good! Her service is totally rude!!! And as a manager sucks!",0
"Super slow. Many items not available, disgusting customer service. Staff did not care at all.",0
Take to long and they don't get your order right  employees to slow and on there phone joking and laughing,0
"What's up with this Lady taking 2 Hours every morning to clean just the men's restroom,this is every morning,and don't even ask her to let you in just to wash hands...she'll send you to ypur house or women's restroom.",0
"Long waits, even on drive-through! Not the friendliest staff either..Wasup McDonalds...step it up on your customer service...your fries can only keep me coming back for so long",0
Quite possibly the worst McDonald on this plan,0
They said is 24 hours but do not come to this place at 3:30 am they said is close ! Is not right I drive 15 min to come here and they said is close ! Worse ever !,0
Honestly can't give a zero stars but I would if I could. This place was nasty. Dont know how they havent been shut down by health department.,0
Place didn open ,0
Would've eaten there if there wasn't a homeless man sitting their loitering and making the dining area smell like piss.,0
They never get your order right and if you go between 5 and 6 am through the drive-through they going to always tell you system down customers please check your order before you leave there please,0
"Mornings after 6 system down, therefore no food to be served. Or they sorry we're closed. When you have 24hr service and nothing is ready.",0
Worst Mc Donalds ever visited!!! The worst service and quality!,0
The lady working there was VERY rude and loud. She yelled at the delivery guys who came to pick up their orders. Very disrespectful!,0
"Is not possible,always long wait for the drive thru,always 1 hour to get your food,please fix the problems.",0
"Slow employees, not being really kind, to many uber eats before you, not too much attention on the place being clean.",0
"Food is disgusting like any McDonald's
Staff...not so much different from food
If u wanna be fat, suffer a heart attack...those kind of things...come to this place... it's the right one.",0
Long waiting time at nights I waited for an hour for drive thru,0
"Terrible,the works was rude..I had to ask for napkins,ketchup,and BBq sauce for my nuggets  and they gave me buffalo sauce instead.The ice tea tasted old and smelled sour.",0
I today sat in line For 40minutes for a order. They need more staff if that case,0
"Ordered 3 sandwiches and received only bread, no meat no cheese. Only noticed when I got home. Congrats ",0
Garbage service. In the drive thru line for 30 minutes. No exaggeration. Place should be shut down.,0
Horrible service 30 minutes for chicken nuggets... that should never happen management is definitely a must,0
Food was ok for Mickey D's... But the basket was horrible.. Didn't care... Didn't even wanna be there.. Didn't want my business..,0
They don't honor their own advertises specials 1.49 ice coffee any size,0
The web says open 24 hours and they closed when we were in the line No customer service,0
"Closed bathroom because of covid or cause you don't want to clean ?
Basic service for customers.",0
I had 2 laptops and phone stolen from the car park in this restaurant. There are no safety cameras and this is a locally known by police trouble spot along with Dennys,0
Waiting 45 min in the drive thru.... never again.. horrible,0
This is the worst McDonald I hav,0
"Terrible service!!! My fries were cold and soggy, chicken nuggets were burnt and old and even my soda was flat",0
Very dirty place. Restrooms without toilet paper. Cooked burger in wrong way against directions placed in the order. Not recommend.,0
"Saw the manager come out the back picking his nose, straight up digging for gold in that thing, then start serving people with no gloves #CmonSon",0
"Don't forget the condominiums,  because they won't offer it. No ketchup,  no napkins  being so rude. Won't come back here again.",0
"Cold food, gave different order to us, forgot to put almost the half of what we ordered.",0
"Poor attention from the team, casher and manager, discrimination against homeless person that wanted to buy food. Not a recommended place to visit.",0
Horrible the employee that work in that place they don't  care. I WAITED 1HR for a drinks in drive thru.,0
Horrible service. Closed before time posted. Dirty,0
"The employees are not in the cashier window for more than 30 min and all the cars are waiting .... I
Am waiting",0
Rude employees and managers and a lot employees or managers DONT speak English. This is AMERICA!!!!! I should not have to go to a place in America and deal with non English speaking people. RIDICULOUS,0
Sat in drive thru lane for 45min at 3:40 AM. Ridiculous wait time. Ended up going to Checkers.,0
"Thru the years, I have seen how the people working in this particular mcDonald's changed for the worse.",0
"Terrible went for breacfsdt drive thru and  they give me my order incomplete, sadly I found out already at home with mi wife and 2 children what a disappointment.",0
"Rude cashiers, waited for lmost 40mns in drive thru why do they make 2 lanes waste of time",0
Very rude at drive thru. Management needs to work on who they have at the speaker and window.,0
"If you go to this store after 10 pm be prepared to wait for your food more than 30 minutes, terrible service, I waited for a meal 35 minutes!",0
"Takes way too long come to answer at drive thru, drove around and staff were on their phone.",0
"This is the worse service I ever seen in my life, they have all those emigrants working, slower than snails.",0
DO NOT GO!!!!!### the WORST customer service!!!! Manager does not do anything to solve a problem when drug addicts fight with customers!!!!!!! It's literally a McDonald's for the homeless.,0
"Such bad, rude , and unprofessional service. Worst McDonalds I've ever been to",0
Too much wait at midnight. Burger had unsatisfing taste and coke had no soda,0
Girl at drive through with ear buds and very rude .. .stay home and give a job who needs it,0
"Horrible customer service
Long wait time",0
Food was slow. Manager (short hair woman) was having a mental breakdown or something and was being rude. She needs to be fired. Her name was Elizabeth or something. Very unprofessional.,0
"4 consecutive weeks, Every Monday the dining room is not swept or mopped. They don't open at 530am. For the last month on Mondays they won't have orange juice. They say the machine doesn't work and they can't serve it. The cashier tells me Some other worker will squeeze the orange because it's freshly squeezed. I would understand one mistake, but it's occurring every Monday.",0
"My daughter, her friends and i was at this particular McDonalds while visiting the boardwalk (out of town visitors). There was roaches all over the place and they were big. The place was not clean. Homeless people surrounded the place.  I will never go back and i have already told a lot of people that were headed that way.",0
"Waited in line for half an hour, and it seemed like forever at the pick-up window.  I asked if they were short staffed, and she said they were waiting on the fries. But when I got them they were cold. She offered no explanation until I got tired of waiting",0
"this McDonald's is more expensive than others in the area, and be warned that individuals in their garage are very sensitive to the fact if you have your phone out and become vocallyworried that you are taking pictures or video of them.",0
"Frequently at this location, someone is spewing toxic gases into the air, violating local laws (& humane rights; despite a security guard on site).
Cashiers are expected to be able to actually perform elementary subtraction, such as 12-7=5; (because the US doesn't mint 3 dollar bills) and I already have enough singles to stuff Magic Mike's g-string.
If this location has take out hours & dining room hours, that should be posted; on entry ways & online. Otherwise, we patrons expect to sit down, not be told the seating area is closed 30 minutes prior to closing and 20+ minutes after opening. MGMT should schedule site & employee hours accordingly.",0
"Rude staff asked the manager about the birthday grimace promotion and she said ""I don't know"" and walked away.",0
Did not help me with a refund and took awhile to convince worker to take a look at kiosk to fix it.,0
"Honestly the worst McDonald's, you'd expect more from one by the beach and turns out to be the worst experience.",0
I'm really disappointed in McDonald's in Santa monica went got food to take to husband and the drink carrier broke they wouldn't give me a replacement for my loss had to reorder and replace myself they were ice coffee and a mocha frappe,0
Horrible service walked in with wife an 3 kids ordered 3 pancake meals an 2 sandwich meals 5 people 5 meals they called our order got 1 pancake 2 sandwiches no full meals had to wait as they dissed us in Spanish (I speak it I know what you said) then get my other 2 pancakes but they absolutely refused to give me 2 hash browns will not stop again,0
"Full of homeless people not like I'm unaware of our global situation with homelessness, but if you looking to sit down chill and eat don't do it at this one. It doesn't have a drive thru, so order ahead for pick up, it does have self service ordering kiosk.",0
Homeless hang out ! Every day customers are being attacked in the store why security guards stand around and watch !,0
"SOOOO busy, all I ordered was a drink and who knows who actually got it!",0
"This is hands down THE worst McDonald's ever! The staff are rude, racist, and intentionally slow. Don't waste your time. There was a fistfight in the dining area and the men's room was full of weed smoke.",0
"Very bad service the employees are very roud the security guy not professional
I won't never come back to this ugly store",0
Waited 20 minutes for a mobile order that they have to serve to our table. Finally I went to the counter and asked about my order. They rudely said they don do table s,0
They fired me for refusing service to a rude customer,0
"Not happy with that location!
Dining room has a big sign in window stating Dining room open. But yet it was not open. It was 12:00 in the afternoon!! Why wasn't it open?! It seems that they have their own rules!
Plus wasn't allowed to order at window either! I don't have a car, I was on my bike.",0
"Horrible customer service and they messed up my order. The lady who took my order was rushing and had a rude attitude. She didn even listen to what I wanted. She kept staring at me and almost forced me to get something easier off the menu, as I had ordered somet",0
The worker could not get my order on time and had an attitude,0
So I come in for my daily coffee but need to use the restroom and of course you have to buy before you can use the restroom and wash hands ,0
"Order was screwed up, and the hash browns in both combo meals were barely cooked to just above raw.
Amazing their staff could screw up two breakfast meals in the same order in an automated process. SAD.",0
"To many young kids was there
the place was to busy for family & tourism",0
"Had to go and wipe my 5 star review and turn it to a 2 star since last year this whole place has turned into yet another slow Hispanic ran restaurant. Used to have a diverse staff and be consistently speedy and hot, now it takes 10 mins with no one else in line to get some fries and nuggets?while everyone is standing around twiddling their thumbs, I퐒e been here at least 60 times, and every time I퐒e been here post COVID reopening it been this same situation with the change of the whole employee personnel now it",0
The worst and most expensive McDonalds I have ever seen. I had to request a manager to intervene before the cashier would let me order what I wanted instead of what she wanted me to buy. Definitely not a happy meal.,0
"On Nov 22//21, I went to use the men restroom and it was so filthy and because this is a place where a lot people visit the attention to the restrooms should be made more often",0
Definitely everything has changed in this McDonald location. The food was alright what I didn like was the area location homeless getting crazy inside the restaurant. Looks like the one security who,0
"The locations looks great and has 8 of machines that allow you to order and pay, but the service was horrible. I ordered a sundae for my mom and after 10 minutes of waiting, I saw one employee feel a tear in her pants below her butt and then she went and fixed herself a sundae and left. At this same moment another came up and asked about the sundaes for his family that he ordered 20 minutes prior. I was given a refund without fuss before leaving. The bad part to all of this was there were about 12 people working at the location during my visit which was more than enough to prepare and delivery the food quickly.",0
It's a McDonald's that food is the same as every other McDonald's is decent didn't like the place because it was too crowded too messy and took forever just to get a soda or no people were nice workers were nice,0
"This Black lady at cash register took my order fine, another black lady with dark blue shirt red brown hair served my food.
Minutes later I return one item was made wrong!
Same black lady asked her staff to fix it then she gave it to me without checking it and I find out that they did it wrong again! I took to her for the third time and then she asked her staff again to do it again!
Instead of making sure it done correct! She proceeded to go help another customer which took her about 4 to 5 minutes when she knew I come first but she didn care! I asked her again when she returned to her post where is my food and She got quickly defensive with me and refuse to get me a hot free fries since I had to wait too long for my order!
I throw away my cold fries and just proceeded to get the hell out of there!!
I am done arguing with these black or not black l management fault!! They just hire any one for the job and they don pay attention to what goes on in thei",0
So overall they usually have one of the fastest services especially when it comes to McDonald's in regards to what I'm doing doordash. Only problem being at this location is a hub for intoxicated panhandling homeless people.,0
"The People Who Work There Were Very Rude&Short In Response.
There Parking Garage Is Hazardous!!",0
"Really rude staff, too bad service. Avoid if you can. There are so many other better places to eat or drink around.
They would literally cheat you!",0
"Too many homeless people that kept walking in and out of this location, we couldn't eat comfortably because they smelled so bad as they passed by. I understand they can't help it due to their situation but if you have a hard time tolerating body odor of various homeless people walking back and forth in this McDonald's location then you should definitely avoid this location.",0
"This plave is not a good place. They used to have blacks there too. Now all hispanic and trey just remodeled. All of sudden after the remodel all the staff all like the same race. I though McDonald's was equal opportunity employer. Guess not. Today I went there to use the restroom. I was told I couldn't use the restroom unless I bought something. I explained that it was an emergency and I just have to take a number one and I will be on my way. I asked to speak to the manager, the manager told me the same thing you have to buy something. I told the manager I really had to use the restroom it was an emergency I'll be in and out that's all I need it and I was still denied. Every time I come to this place is always something. Things to give me cold food all the time I would ask for fresh food and they would make me wait 20 to 30 minutes I would just wait while standing there looking at her. I wasn't really strong with expressing myself oh, now I express myself a little bit more. I just thought that everybody should know is this place really isn't a nice place to be I wouldn't give them a dime of my money. When did they treat people and I've always treated people is not okay if I was a business owner in a McDonald's along to me I would fire the entire staff shut the McDonald's down and start new with the whole new staff of all Races and ethnicities different religions in different ways of being themselves instead of running it like Fort Knox and no one even speaks English. Not a respectable place and I think a lot of changes need to happen. The last thing that we all need is a petition being signed to shutdown a very nasty, disrespectful, unprofessional in very unreliable restaurant in one of the most popular places in California. Let's get back together McDonald's or else I'll go to the next level and bringing all these customers that also it's like this McDonald's. We even go one more step above and bring the in all your future customers who have never been there before just to mention on how they've had experiences at McDonald's that were so exceptionally great and then compare it to the way that you treat all the customers who've walked out of McDonald's and see if they'll never come back I don't think we want this to be a topic of discussion.",0
I ordered from here twice and I ordered a cheeseburger with bacon and onions and the first time they didn even put the bacon on it (The bacon that I spend my money on) and now they didn put the onion on it.,0
"Very bad exp, I believe I goten bad food.",0
"if you're a tourist DON'T go to McDonald's especially this one, rude service, poor choice, worst fast food chain in US by far",0
No dollar menu anything but drinks here! Even coffee is 2 bucks! The service is spotty and confusing at best! The place is small and serves the end of the busiest street that leads to the pier....ultra poor planning on space for quality of service/business. There are a lot kf vagrants at this location but they are for the most part harmless.,0
They allow the homeless to beg in front of their door and people buy them food so they go inside and eat. The problem is their smell!!! We bring our tourists families and end up totally embarrassed.,0
"Manager sucks. I called her over for help and she ignored me. Seating arrangements are disorganized. The soda fountain machine is always dirty. Hardly any ice. When you press for a certain soda, it runs water for a while. Too many homeless people. The only decent thing here is the food.",0
"Worst McDonald's in the world, that's a big statement but its the only one that fits.
I ordered breakfast on a Saturday. It wasn't too busy but when I got my food I was missing some sandwiches, my pancakes were super cold like if they had just defrosted them and put them in my bag and the hashbrowns were literally stuck to the wrapper and the bag they came in looked like it had been dunked in the deep frier.

Save your money, go eat somewhere else where the food is actually edible.
To clarify I'm not bagging on all McDonald's, I quite like the food BUT this location is terrible, my suggestion is to go elsewhere",0
Got my order wrong took forever to serve my sweet tea. Crispy chicken had a large piece of not so crispy chicken w/ the foulest tasting sauce I'll never order again  watered down sodas so much you'd think it was club soda. Never again,0
We asked for a cup of water after we were done eating our food inside. Lady said we needed to purchase until she seen my orange juice cup.. she then proceeded to give us a tiny cup. What exactly were we supposed to do with that? Meanwhile others got a decent sized cup for water. What do you lose to give out a cup of WATER?,0
"This McDonald is always very busy so I understand why their customer service isn the best.

Even so, I still don understand",0
"I expect crowding because it's close to the beach. The ice machine is always out, they don't have enough fresh brewed tea to refill the container, and some of the employees have attitude. The security guard tends to trip, but it's not always the same guard. Service is pretty fast considering the volume of customers. I only go there because of proximity.",0
"No Refills!  It took about 10 minutes for me and everyone else in line to get their order done. They could only give you 3 ranch for 20 Chicken Nuggets, not even 4. Fo",0
"This was an ok McDonald, but I liked going to this place because it was so busy during the summer, so you are more likely to get hot and fresh food. Now that it December 2020, they are slacking, I guess they are having more problems with the homeless or druggies or drug dealers outside of their business, but twice in the last two weeks I got cold and half-cooked fries after 9pm.

Maybe because I퐉 a gang stalking victim, this is happening.  REPORT ANY AND ALL COMPLAINTS TO CORPORATE.

On December, 13th 2020, I got the free double cheeseburger, it was a cold burger a",0
Loads of homeless people around,0
"Go anywhere else. Not here. Beyond the counter, this place is never clean.  Glorified truck stop.  Too many other options, next door and, nearby that are more deserving of your business. Especially, since the ""dining room"" is no longer open 24 hours.  No drive through. Sad. Literally, steps from the pier. The collective grime of all of Santa Monica resides on this location surrounding sidewalks. The homeless aren't the issue.  It is the mentally disturbed , the hustlers  and questionable addicts. This is not a family friendly location.  Wisely most families recognize this and steer clear.  These truths sometimes slip pass the trained smiles of the cashiers and you see the weariness and defeat.  No other business has these issues!  Not one.  Food?  No problems.",0
I got a raw meat burger. It was cooked outside of it. But inside under the part was cooked was very raw meat. That was unfit to eat. And made me sick. I don't prefer NO body to go eat their at all they will. Kill you with uncooked meat in your burgers.,0
No drive thru; there is a parking lot area; very busy and chaotic; service was reasonable.,0
Had been driving for several hours and needed to use the restroom before ordering. But employee was refusing to open the locked bathroom before I ordered. Extremely rude. At least it was clean and food was ok.,0
"If I could do 0 stars I would. There is no place to lock a bike so I had to take it in with me. The ecurity guard?tried to get me to leave because I have a bike. I퐉 not leaving a $3,000 bike at the door with all these homeless people around who will steal anything. Then they refused to take my order because I wouldn lea",0
"No drink refills.
Bad service ",0
Food was not hot fries to salty,0
"Worst McDonalds ever.  Customer service is non existant. They act like they're doing you a favor by letting you order food in their establishment. Then it took 20 minutes to get a simple order. Heard MANY complaints while we waited. All McDonald's are worse since the kiosks came in, but this location is a disaster.  Avoid .",0
They used to be super cool! Since the remodel they turned into nazis! No water without a receipt. The stupid guard started a fight with a homeless man who came in. I dont know who sprayed it but pepper spray was sprayed. There were little kids in there. Cleared the place out. They are trying way too hard to not help ANYBODY,0
"Ordered a triple cheeseburger & when I opened up my burger it was single, I go up & say it's wrong and I get ""We don't have triple cheeseburgers"". Apparently putting 3 patties on a burger is prohibited, but other locations are fine with me ordering this. Will not be returning.",0
"Filthy place, both dining area and rest rooms. Staff member who took our order didn't know what an Americano was, even though it's on their own coffee menu, buttermilk chicken tenders were inedible, looked amd felt like it had been reheated too many times.",0
Poor customer service with the cashier,0
"Worst one I've ever been to! They were rude, an employee was arguing with a customer plus it was super dirty! We walked out!",0
"I need to use the bathroom facilities before I ordered. Mind you, the line was long. I was refused until I purchased something which was my intention but first thing first. The manager as well as security staff were very rude. I will never step foot into that place again.",0
"At first, I felt hungry so I went to this very fancy Mickey D's.  But then while getting back home ( which was a long way from the Santa Monica Pier ) I felt nostalgic and my stomach was hurting really bad.  So I had to stop at Carl's Jr. on  Newhall for the bathroom.",0
"Worst customer service ever. Manager is rude and racist. I have been there twice and have witnessed the bad training of employees. Manager in nightshift charge wont help out at all. And I witness how rude she was to some customers, and when I asked to talk to a manager she insulted me and turned me away .  Mcdonalds. You should take complaints into consideration. All those complaints from us the customers.  I'm afraid if I go again instead of a big mac I'll get a mcwhooping.",0
"This review is for the young lady that worked the night of April 7th, she was repeating the ticket numbers to customers after her cowoker behind the counter yelled out the numbers. I was standing with all the other people waiting for their orders. I hear my order get called, i grab it, and she tells me 퐇et me see your ticket im literally right here?.. Ahhhh of course your right there but since im also right here Ill go ahead and grab it since im there with my ticket in hand mind you. To the lady with braides and glasses who appears to be the age of a co",0
The worst service ever... the people behind us got their orders but our order never been processed. We decided to cancel our order instead. The manager never apologized for that error. I still got the receipt. If ever the corporate head wants to contact me I am willing to give them what took place in that McDonald's. I hope the manager will get fired for it!!!!,0
"No refills, ruins the Mcdonalds tradition. Staff is nice , but its too packed and not to much staff to help getting drinks.. Bring back the soda machine.",0
Too many homeless hang out in front of here. A lot of them are violent. No drink refills here because people would take cups out of the trash and steal soda.,0
"Cold food, not prepared as ordered. Complained and they didn't seem to care. Would not recommend at all .",0
"Cashier had her hair in a ponytail and so did all the other workers (that's not allowed , servsafe states you can only have you're hair in a braid or bun when working with food) one of the cooks had on of the sides her shirt in a knot exposing her lower right stomach. I asked the manager and he said the cashier had her hair down in a pony tail because she was almost leaving and the chick with the shirt up was because he shirt got in the way of her cleaning. OH! BTW she was cooking and sweeping with out washing hands !.",0
This place is dirty and employees don't care. Also homeless hangout here all day everyday. It's a good thing police come here often so they keep crime down.,0
"Attitude. Lack of knowledge of procedures. Terrible customer service. The place is filthy. Who runs this place? Definitely not a place I would recommend if you're having a good day. This place will ruin that, wholesale. Good riddance.",0
The old lady on the cashier is so RUDE. She speaks poorly english and is rude.,0
"Massive homelessness dirty outside.
No parking NO drive thru security more worried about masks then the drugs dealing at the door.",0
"Horrible service after the remodeling. Very rude attendant, they refused the refill traditional on all other Mcdonalds restaurants and security was super rude reminding I should leave the parking in 30 minutes (I was in the store for 12 minutes)",0
Rude cashier. Dirty seats and tables. And full of very crazy looking people/drugs (i felt a little bit uncomfortable) The Hot chocolate didn't taste like HC at all.,0
"Asked for refund and the cashier faked the transaction I asked if it completed and she said yes. I did not get the refund.

The sandwich was disrespectful 占쏙",0
"Horrible customer service I have ever seen. There is a staff named LOVE, she has the worst behave with customers ever. She even dont know how to talk. She did nit gave me a ranch",0
Definitely not a great place to eat no refills they charged for it employees wearing air pods  hats to the back restrooms dirty no trying to clean it. Just horrible restaurant,0
"I ordered a chicken buttermilk combo. Didnt get a drink. And when i tried to explain to the manager what happened, she wouldnt let me speak. Unsatisfactory",0
very bad experience the employee are super rude they have very bad attitude,0
"My experience visiting this place was not good. It was not because the place that is a nice building with many things to do specially for kids but for the service. This McDonald's offers Pasta and Pizza and I had the terrible idea of order a pizza along with many other things. I have to wait more then an hour and 15 minutes for it.  The place was plenty of tourists many of them in groups like mine and most of them had the same problem. The staff attention was not good. They were overwhelmed and didn't warning about the long waiting time. In some cases one hour and a half. This is considered the largest McDonald's in the World so it is another tourist attraction in the city. They should improve their service, especially in the pizza area. As a positive comment, I received a second ration of one of my orders for free in retribution for the long wait. My recomendation is not to order pizza if you are in a hurry, with a large group and during busy times.",0
"Long wait at drive thru despite one car in front of me. 15 minutes to get a fish sandwich and drink. Sandwich was disgusting and wound up throwing it
Out. Staff seemed confused as my order sat on the counter with workers waking past it many times before they finally gave it to me.",0
This is the slowest McDonald's I've ever experienced.  The staff is difficult to deal with and 5 out of 5 times our order is wrong. Great location and clean facilities though.,0
"Pure trash. Worst experience on multiple occasions. Card swiped and charged twice. Took and act of Congress to get it reversed. Paid at the first window, drove to the second window, and employee says, ""You didn't pay for your food!"" Show the receipt and no apology or remorse, just ""oh?!"" Hands food to me. Last episode, shortchanged $20 of a $100 Bill. GM says next, we checked everything except what was actually take from the register and denies error in the transaction, but say I'll give you a free meal and dessert?! I can't wait to see that location shut down for good. Shame on the franchise owner and the corporation for the service at that location. Filing a police report and BBB complaint.",0
"Good morning, Please tell me if this matters or if I'm being to sensitive or petty or overly concerned. Maybe because I didn't have my coffee this morning.

I patronize this McDonalds in Oak Park every morning. This morning I forgot my wallet. I asked the Supervisor if I could pay them the less than $5.00 breakfast tomorrow. They said so sorry No. I pleaded with this new manager that I'd never seen before. I asked for the manager that I'd spoken with on several occasions.
She refused to see me, and he stated that her response would be the same!!! I asked him what was to happen to food on the counter in front of us. He said it would be discarded!!!!

Seriously, I asked. So, I said that you'd rather throw it away then let me have it, a faithful customer.....So my lesson is now, Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson. McDonalds doesn't care about my patronizing their establishment and I'm going to seriously break my coffee habit. No more McDonalds from Oak Park on Madison for me.
A lesson well learned, can you believe my feeling was hurt when he said that my breakfast was to be discarded.",0

"After decades of serving families, McDonald's is on their way out. I blame it on the district managers not doing their jobs. McDonald's needs individuals who can read, comprehend and speak English. Today I went there for lunch. I ordered #6 Filet-o-Fish sandwich meal. I ended up with 10 peice chicken nuggets. Hmmmm....I  guess the order taker did not know the menu item or understand when I said Filet-o-Fish sandwich. I quickly caught the error and told the cashier. She said, ""So you don't want it?"" Then, the manager came along to find out what the problem was. I  explained and received the sandwich. I left and when I  got home, I found out I  had a frosted breakfast pastry in a ,Filet-o-Fish box! Come on now McD's. May we get better service and expect a lot more from you? If not, please close your doors to save the public from the irritation.",0
"What can I say, it's McDonalds.  The food is never cold or smashed. It's hit or miss on the type of employee you'll get at the drive through. They either ""don't want to be here and hate the fact that you're making them work"" or they ""smile and make you feel welcomed"". It's close to my office for a quick breakfast or lunch.

I'm editing my last post and changing my rating. I waited in the Drive-Thru for 10 minutes with no one coming on the line. The other line however three cars went through while I sat there. I pulled forward to place my order at the window and I was told that I had to drive back around. The level of unacceptable is insane.  I try to be understanding of fast food workers because I know they deal with ugly people but this takes the cake.  The day is Monday June 11th 2023 at 345pm. The morning crew is a good bunch of workers, however the afternoon crew has always been extremely slow.",0

"My order is WRONG every time; the most frustrating customer experience. I live near this new location and have visited 6 times since the remodel, and I've concluded that this location is a 120% mess. If all of my orders are wrong I can imagine thousands of others are driving off with incorrect purchases. I ask for no cheese every time, and guess what is in my order.. CHEESE. Or my frys are half full, or the hashbrowns are completely missing, no syrup/ utensils are in the bag as requested. On 3 occasions we were told to pull ahead and park on the side while they remake my order, an employee brings out an incorrect order.. yes 3 times. Today this ""New"" team member blatantly tells me to go in and take of it... what the hell? Every other time I let the incorrect order slide, but today I decided to speak with the store manager. I let her know politely about all of my incorrect orders, and she replies ""Sorry"", I then ask ""what is mcdonalds doing about this, its every time the order is wrong?"" She responds ""I'm so sorry""... I ask again and same response.  Meanwhile the woman next to me is asking about the replacement order that she put in ten minutes ago, they apologize to her and say they are going to reinput it.... this new location is a joke, its truly insane that a Mcdonalds is operating like this, and its been a few months since their brand new building opened.",0
"They forgot half of my order, when I called them back ( it was drive though) the girl that worked there gave me huge attitude, rolled her eyes on me and shut down the window , after new moments have me my bag with NOT CORRECT ORDER still.

Tip to owners : don",0
"The white guy at the drive thru was good and friendly.  The reception was right.. But when I got my order, it was wrong.  I went inside to get corrected. The cashier and manager had some sort of rival  gang problem. Instead of walking away from the problems. They all started fighting. It was horrible. I won't ever go back there.",0
"The studio city location has the worst service of any restaurant I know of. Drive thru is marginally ok, but inside is chaos. There are people in the kitchen who occasionally come out to the counter to reluctantly help customers. No one is charge. It makes me wish we had a real McDonalds nearby. I left a cold order of fries on the counter because no one called out the order number. Never did get my hamburger. I'm giving them one star because the food is fine, if and when you get it.",0
How rude of the driver thus person that worked on 3/15/2023 around 7:50pm we were wanting to get some fries and chicken nuggets and some drinks and hoping to enjoy a amazing meal from this McDonald's but we lost our appetites due to the drive thu person using a loud rude unprofessional tone the worker seemed rushed and we didn't even get our sodas due to the person being so rude.

If there are people in the Drive-Thru everyone in the parking lot is trapped in the parking lot.... no menus, no front of store employees and when you do show at the counter, it's like the employees are scared to leave the kitchen like they have high anxiety of actually facing someone or something. You can stand there at the counter forever and no one will ever come",0

"Very disappointing after they rebuilt the whole building.  It is supposed to be the most modern of Equipment and yet it was the slowest experience I have ever had at a McDonald's, and only for two egg McMuffins.  Then, the English muffin was burnt on both sandwiches.  The staff definitely did not want to be there.  It is my closest McDonald's but I will definitely be driving the longer distance next time.  Just avoid this spot no matter what.",0
"It took 1 plus hours to get thru the drive thru.  The drive thru is such that once in line you cannot get out. No one apologised for the abnormal wait time.

Especially for a fast food establishment.",0

Never again will I order from here. 2 times ordered mistakes were made. Both were using the app so was apps fault but because they were short staff they could not find time to help and fix my order. Waited 20 minutes to leave with nothing and not even sure my order was canceled.,0
We have given this newly remodeled McDonalds a few chances. The only difference is they now can jam more cars in their drive thru. They will still make you pull up and wait for your order and forget that you're waiting. Same problem as before. Having this happen multiple times seems ridiculous and we don't even frequent this place. Location is convenient but not worth it.,0
"My experience was ok. They forgot little things in my order, like a straw for iced tea, and cream and sugar that i requested.

What's that a consolation prize for losing the Big Mac.",0
Worst drive thru set up I ever experienced. No way out unless you go into the drive thru line and wait.,0

"After waiting in drive through for 20 minutes,  I ordered a filet o fish and large fries with ketchup,  just to get a regular size fries not even filled to the top either , and a  filet of fish with no tarter sauce , and 1/4 of a peice of cheese.  I always check my food right then and there because this location usually messes up drive though orders , and  when I showed them  the employee gave me a attitude and rolled their eyes at me . She even tried to say the fries fell out of the box into the bag . I showed her the bag being empty ,and even made the comment. Even no ketchup.  She then said I had to pull out of the drive through to wait for my order to be fixed it would be 5 to 10 minutes, since my lunch is only 30 minutes, I had no choice but to leave.",0

Won't recommend this location to anyone looking for decent McDonald's food/drinks. Makes me glad I only ordered fries and drinks, I'd hate to see what else they'd wreck.",0
"Used the app to order, but took 30 minutes to get it to me at the counter. That's way too long. Tons of people got served before I did and my order was placed well before the other customers showed up. The only thing going for this place is that it's 24Hours drive through. And dont use the app, relaying orders to individual stores may have some bugs.

Update: this place is torn down. The building razed and the lot surrounded by fencing. I guess the bums from the nearby overpass finally took its toll. Too bad cuz the 24 hour drive thru was pretty convenient.",0
This location should have stayed closed. Why do they have a re-opening sign when they're only operating for drive thru. What about the pedestrians? The ones who can't drive? At least I was able to walk in and  order food before they remodeled. I live less than a mile from here and I can't walk over and physically order food? And why is there a parking lot if we can't walk in. And how rude the associate was that I basically should have known better that they were only running the drive thru? You're better off going to the one on burbank Blvd. Who puts a double lane on a drive thru and doesn't expect problems? This isn't it McDonald's... 20 minutes sitting in a drive thru...,0
Employee at the first window was very helpful and he made sure my order was right however the girl at the second one ignored me and looked confused. The muffin sandwich bread was stale and very tough and the hash browns were cold and also tasted like they sat on a shelf for way too long. After 2 bites I threw it in the trash and purchased a sandwich from a near by gas station much better food). I'm from out of town and on my way to a meeting so returning wasn't an option.,0
"I had quite possibly my worst McDonald's experience ever here. After ordering a sausage egg mcmuffin with a biscuit instead of English muffin, the order taker said

""ok I'll punch it in so it comes out a good deal for you.""

Um... Ok...

When I got the order it ONLY had egg. I politely informed the person at the drive through window, but they refused to correct the order, saying in a absolute terms that this is what I ordered and if I wanted what I ACTUALLY ordered I'd have to get back in line and place a new order!!

What the hell???

I won't be coming back here!",0
"I'm not sure what's wrong with this location, but half the time I go there the food I get is old and cold. Today I went through the drive-thru and they had a rush, there were about 10 cars ahead of me. So I'm not sure how they can serve me cold food when they're constantly feeling orders. Just extremely disappointed with this location. I ordered a big Mac combo and the big Mac was cold and the fries were even colder",0

All I ordered was 2 mcribs for $6 drive-thru. They asked me to pull into parking lot and wait. Ended up waiting 25 minutes before I got my order. They claimed the manager couldn't find me. It is a very small parking lot. The manager didn't try very hard. I ended up calling them to remind them about my order. They came out with the same mcribs and handed them to me by this time the were slightly warm and very soggy. The only explanation I got was we're so sorry. I just left immediately otherwise I would have lost my cool if I stayed. Ended up just throwing my order away after one bite. Lost my appetite.,0
Bad Service Bad Attitude! Gave me the wrong drink and charge me for 2 sandwiches when I ordered one. I was in a hurry to the office (around 8AM) and I didn't have time to argue.

The woman on the intercom wasn't really friendly and did not explain to me why they were not serving breakfast at this time. I thought breakfast was served throughout the day no matter what but I guess I was wrong. I've never had an issue with this McDonald's but this was a first and disappointing",0
"This Asian guy on the second window asks me to drive to their parking area because the order is not ready and said he will bring it to me. I waited for 10 minutes in the car and he never brought it.  I decided to walk in the restaurant, they had the bag just laying there.

Why would he ask me to wait in the car if he never planned on bringing it to me??  Bad service!",0
"My whole order was a lost, the oatmeal was not closed correctly and so all the order got wet and the oatmeal did not cook right .Then, they didn't even supply me with spoons. I asked for cream and sugar in my coffee, and they gave it to me black and  they got upset because asked them please add what I had asked for, in my coffee.
I ordered two breakfast burritos and they were cold, it's frustrating how bad some employees are trained they don't have any pride on what they do, nor care about service they provide is just a shame.",0
"We ordered our food (It was free egg mcmuffin day) and before we even sat down they brought it to us, clearly it was made before we ordered. It was cold in the middle. They proceeded to stare, whisper, and laugh at us. I was uncomfortable eating the food, afraid they had spit in it so we left without touching a thing.",0

"It took several minutes for someone to take our order, then our order took forever and was wrong. My Mc muffin was rock hard and instead of the cheeseburger my friend ordered he received a Mc chicken with cheese. they were out of sweet tea and the little straw trash bin on the soda fountain was bursting out and spilling into the ice catch. This facility is dirty, packed both inside and in the drive thru, and is obviously understaffed.",0
"They got my order wrong... This happens often.

To make things worse they are very inefficient. Ordered a small fries, they served 10 other people before I got mine. Seriously, fill up a small bag with fries while you await other order burgers. I used to worl at McDonalds 10 years ago and know how it should be run. Horrible!

Ironically two other individuals complained about their order while I waited and one got into an argument with the manager over cold cheese.",0
"The drive through at this McDonald's has always been busy every time I've gone.  It's honestly worth driving a little extra to another location if you are in a hurry.  I've been stuck in the drive thru line for over 15 minutes on several occasions just ordering a single cheeseburger.  Granted, compared to In and Out that's nothing, but this is McDonalds.  That aside, the interior has always been pretty clean when I've went inside.  If you go for breakfast on the weekends, once again, be prepared to wait.  They do take Apple Pay and Android pay!  The one time I used it, the person behind the counter actually knew what it was.  So many places tell you they don't have it but just don't know what it is.  Another big plus is the drive through is 24 hours.",0
"The staff who took our order doesn't have customer service. Very impatient. In fairness he is so quick taking our order and he knows his menu.
Sad that frappe machine doesn't work.
No choice as thia is the only place that's open for breakfast here at universal.",0
"I ordered a Mcdouble, which was on their outside drive thru menu. When it came up on the order screen it was shown as a Bacon Mcdouble, I told them that I just wanted the regular Mcdouble, no bacon. So all they did was note NO Bacon, and still charged me the full price for a Bacon Mcdouble. When I got to the window I clarified again, but was told they didn't have that in their system, and that I had to pay the full price for the Bacon Mcdouble. I asked ro talk to the manager who then told me they didn't have what I ordered. I told him to go out and check his menu, because it was on there. He told me he didn't need to, that it was not on the menu. He was very rude and dismissive. I realize it is just a few cents difference, but why should anyone pay for something they didn't order, especially if what you ordered is on the menu. I see no reason to be treated so unprofessionally, and rudely. I don't recommend visiting this McDonalds, luckily there are plenty of others near by who treat people with respect.",0
"Drive thru order was botched. We paid for two milks and upon arriving home, discovered that there were no milks and instead of the healthier grilled chicken that my wife ordered, she was unable to eat the crispy chicken that we received due to dietary reasons...what a waste. Hopefully somebody got the milks we bought-

Avoid the drive thru at all costs! This was not the first time; and we should have stopped and checked the order-

Never again",0
I just left there 10 mins ago and my fries were horrible. They weren't even fresh and definitely something I would NEVER give to a customer,0
Had a terrible experience from start to finish.. An order taker in the drive thru even though there was not a back up- he interrupted my ordering- got it wrong(i corrected him)- the cashier had it wrong(i corrected him)- then they handed me the wrong order- then the fish sandwich was burnt and tasted old and the chicken nuggets tasted like very bad chicken.. Worst McDonald's experience ever.,0
I asked for a peppermint mocha and all was well until I realized the hot cup they served it in was cold by the time it was too late and I was already home. Drive thru service not the best when you have to yell out the order multiple times.,0

Kinda scary the way it just lingered in the parking lot without a worry in the world.
Maybe It was Stuart Little and was waiting for his food in the drive thru.

People brought their own food to this place (like 12 people) yams and hard boiled eggs and ordered2 sandwiches and 12 coffees and too all the tables.  People were complaining but management did nothing,0
"The food there sucks, it is so tasteless & I've even got a sausage mcmuffin here & it wasn't done, plus the coke is really bad.. no coke just seltzer water... never again",0
"Cold burgers disgusting looking and tasting meat, the fries were the only ",0
"Slowest drive thru ever, avoid at all costs",0
"Do not eat this food. It will kill you. Is not even food. If there was -5 stars, I would give it that. If you feed the stuff to your kid, there's something really wrong with you.",0
Just left... asked to make sure to add flavor to my iced coffee cus last time they didnt.... well... I got plain iced coffee again!!!,0
Used drive-thru around 2am just to find out that they were only taking cash because the card terminal was not working. I only had a few bucks cash to spend and I even got my oder wrong. Terrible experience!,0
Chicken tenders were hard as rocks. The bun on the buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich was burnt inside and hard. Could not eat!,0
The worst McDonald's to get breakfast really early in the morning I always go try to get breakfast around 4 in the morning and there card reader is never working I don't understand how every day at 4 a.m. they can't accept debit or credit card this is been going on for a very long time,0
"This was one of the worse experiences I've ever had.  We sat in the parking lot for 20 minutes waiting for our order.  They forgot about our order.  Then when I got it, it was missing stuff.",0
This place has changed a lot.They forget about your order or forgets certain things in your order.Now there are more homeless's.Now there are teenagers working there and messing up your order.My grandma asked for a ice cream cone but they gave her a cup instead.I recommend going to a different McDonald's for right now until they fix the problems.,0
How do you mess up this many orders? And the fries were weird. Just go to a different McDonald's,0
It appears this location burned down or was leveled for reconstruction.  There is no building only steel support beams and a fence around the lot.,0
Dining room has gnats Told employee but no reaction Maybe the gnats amoing others is why i raely go. Was in a giant hurry only reason,0
Waited about half an hour in the drive thru.  They informed us they could only accept cash.  No sign telling us that before pulling in.  Don't go here late night.,0
"Same as any other Mc Donald's in the world, a lot of the homeless comunity visits there so it's good to always give them a hand",0
"Disrespectful Employees, piss-flavored nuggets, somebody forgot to flush the toilet avta they've tooka SHET, my a**h** is nicer than this restaurant.",0
"Bad customer service, rude, they lie about giving u condiments. Food is usually missing when u get home.",0
Long wait times for simple orders. Poor management. Unacceptable cleanliness standards.,0
"Unhealthy and poisonous food. Acidic lack of nutrients. Nothing but fat and carbohydrates. Food should be illigal, period",0
Cold fries. Incredibly long wait for 3am (were talking 20 min for each customer). And incredibly horrendous customer service. AVOID THIS PLACE!!!,0
"There is an ""entrance fee"", upon entering and exiting the drive thru. LOL",0
Says 24h but they were closed at 2am (including the drive through),0
They don,0
Did the mobile order thing I asked for extra onions and got none at all that's how difficult it is for these people to understand English and even said it on the receipt extra onions,0
羲羲 羲羲 trash,0
Don't come to this mc Donald's. They always takes forever to prepare your food and constantly passes people in front of you,0
Went thru the drive thru and they forgot 2 fries and reversed my request I asked for no lettuce they gave me lettuce only.,0
"Worst drive thru, took 26 minutes to get order. WORST McDonald's in the world!!",0
"Park lot was very small and congested, I was stuck for 10 mins. Employees are very arogant too.",0
I got my order wrong twice first they gave me coffee instead of hot chocolate and then I said no ketchup on my burger and it had ketchup probably not going there again,0
Ice cream machine always broken. Very low quality location.,0

"Very very slow took a long time be completed,  unorganized but we're very nice employees",0
Long line in drive-thru. Machine not working for atm or credit card. Very sad for such a huge company.,0
Avoid it if you can. The service is terrible; some employees need to go back to training to enhance their costumer service skills.,0
Night service suck and manger has an attitude. During the day. No problems,0
"Could barely get through the line to park, spaces are way to small, and waited 22 minutes to get two coffee's!",0
Very dirty and staff.is.not friendly at all. They act like they don't like their jobs,0
Ordered something small took over 15 mins. People who ordered before me got their food before I did.,0
Slowest McDonald's I've ever been to. 20 minutes trapped in the drive thru line.,0
They were not letting homeless people eat or use the bathroom that we're buying food that's wrong,0
My cup was fingered by the cashier.   Two stars because he gave a new one when I asked.,0
"Crowded parking lot
Homeless camped outside refilling dirty cups
Uber drivers hang out in lot refilling their dirty drink cups
Dirty inside and out
NEVER EVER EVER fill your fry container to the top!!!",0
Not good for health as we all know but a little good food,0
Poorly managed. Management as no problem lying to the customer when an error is made.,0

"Small place, recomended for drive thru or take out",0
"Typical McDonald's just with REALLLLLLLY long drive-thru lines. Nothing special, nothing to write home about.",0
Really long SLOW line at the drive through. Took FOREVER.,0
Too much mayo and burnt bun. Homeless come in and get sodas with old cup - ew,0
No one should ever go to McDonald's for anything but going to the bathroom,0

Very rude female employee. Look like she didnt wanted to work,0
Worst food ever. The hamburgers taste like a paper.,0

I got 3 sloppy vanilla ice cream cones today.,0

Too bad I only bought two coffees and it took me more than 19 minutes and they still moved me to the parking lot and then I had to return because they didn't take what I bought with them lousy service,0
"The food was put in plastic bags and the steam was so hot that it came out as watery. They are supposed to have special delivery bags.

They put some of the food in plastic bags, causing the sweat from the heat of the food itself to cause it to arrive in a watery state. They are supposed to have delivery bags that are not plastic",0
Bad service  I asked for a double hamburger and they gave me one with only one m,0
"Check orders! Sauces are not included.
Long time to cook",0
"Bad service and they always forget to put the complete order, there is always something missing even meat in the hamburger",0
"I bought two meals from them for my friends, and they gave me bread and cheese in exchange for meat. Hahahaha, and the account came out with 30 dollars. Damn the mother of fraud",0
"I ordered a fish burger and it only brings the bread, the fish and mayonnaise. I expected it to bring lettuce and tomato but no, I think it would be better with luchuga and tomato",0

No-no-no-no-no THEY DEMOLISHED IT ,0

the heavy set woman with the short cut quick weave with glasses is very rude and miserable looking . i stood there waiting on the doordash order for 20 min and she didnt ask how could she help me she didn't say anything  she was skipping over the doordash order  and just let me stand there then when the order was done she threw the bag,0
Poor ,0

"Perhaps the most poorly run McDonald in Texas. Visited on the weekend,  so naturally busier, but the management, attitude of employees, and physical condition make this a location, in my opinion, the worst location we퐒e ever visited.
1. Trash everywhere, see pic for example. Trash on the floors, tables, parking lot.
2. Dirty tables. Obviously tables get dirty. So we asked if a team member could wipe down a table to remove ketchup and prior visitor",0
"This is the closets Mickey D near us and we usually always have a good time. This time tonight we asked for extra sauce, the white lady with black hair, thick and wear a brown cardigan and bun? Was VERY RUDE when asked if their was extra sauce in the bag and closeed the sliding door before we can ask for more. She then re-opened it after seeing we were missing additional sauce from our order.. she was very rude cutting me off and stated you need to ask for extra sauce when ordering, since it now a charge for sauce? But anyways we don mind paying? It",0
"Incorrect orders most of the time, missing ingredients in the food or missing chicken nuggets. Poor quality of food.

I am not really a picky eater and don usually complain, but I gave this location a handful of chances?",0

"I ordered a artisan chicken sandwich no tomatoes on 2/22/19 through the drive-thru and when I went to get my food they told me to pull up and wait. I waited half a hour to get this sandwich and chicken nuggets. The sandwich looks like it was thrown together, way too much sauce. It was all over the entire sandwich and on the inside of the box that made the bread soggy. And to top it all off they gave me the head of lettuce and brown lettuce.",0
"Frys were cold, did not give me my large drink that was ordered, and when I asked for my receipt, 3 people just walked around lost.. said forget it and left.",0
I always order the same 4 orders of the 20pc Nuggets. For some odd reason it $12 more expensive at this location than all the other stores in the metroplex. If you like to spend extra money for the same exact thing you can get from another location for cheaper than this is your spot. For me it not. The manager g,0
"Employees always seem bothered by having to work. If you ask for extra of something on your burger, they'll give you none of that and if you take something off they'll make sure you get extra of it... This has happened multiple times now.",0
Nice people but this location lacks staff. Childrens play area not clean. Smells of dirty mop. No soap in children bathroom bathroom smells of  bad odor,0
My hash brown had sooooo much grease that it soaked through the bag. GROSS!!!!!! I'll never get food from this location again!!!!!!!,0
"Manager on duty was very rude.  My husband went today to pick up a missing item from order from the previous night that they forgot to give us.  Instead of going above and beyond to correct their mistake and guarantee excellent customer service, she proceed to interrogate my husband rudely.  In today's world where there are so many options to eat, you think that people would put their best foot forward to make sure their customers have a good experience. I WILL NEVER spend my hard earned money at that location EVER AGAIN",0
"Staff wasn friendly AT ALL and these are literally the worst, coldest, most unsalted, most un",0
It use to be good but they got new owners and it like they are cutting corners to save money. Also the manager  just looks at you and not take your order,0
"Absolutely TERRIBLE customer service. Never in my years of walking this planet have I ever experienced such a terribly trained and terribly managed location. Charging me almost $30 for an order of pancakes and giving ME and attitude when it is THEIR mistake. I very calmly stated that there was an obvious mistake on the receipt, the cashier seemed new, but for some reason the manager thought it was appropriate to put the blame on ME and not their lack of being a good manager and training their employees properly. Disgusting behavior for a problem that required next to NO effort to fix, but the manager sought it better worth their time and effort to be nasty.",0
Incorrect order and couldn't mix Powerade and sprite for some reason.,0
"I have been in line for 10 minutes and how you have it set up you have one line you veer to the right of the intercom or to the left but you only have one lane going to those intercoms. I had several people behind me this lady comes around and cuts me off. I got out of my car I said excuse me you almost hit me and could have caused a catastrophic accident . She said that the lady told her to cut in front of me and I said who and the manager of that McDonald's Sylvia said I did. I told her you almost caused a catastrophic accident and she said it's a two-lane and I said no ma'am and other people in line roll their windows down and said it's only a one lane and Sylvia argued with all of us that were  in line  waiting. You're going to have a catastrophic accident there if you don't get two lanes drawn up. Number two, Sylvia should not be arguing with the customers in line and she did not serve us. I never use profanity I told her it was unprofessional and that it could have caused an accident and other people were telling her the same.I'm very disappointed how McDonald's has lowered the bar in hiring people that will argue with their customers when the  are trying to prevent an accident. I thought the motto is safety first.",0
"Absolutely TERRIBLE customer service is an understatement. The manager screams at everyone who is a customer. To me his young pond has no experience in customer service, I have never been to a place had experienced such a terribly trained and terribly managed location, this is very true. I have gone through drive threw and walked in. To see bad people working there, just do not care. I did send message to McDonald's Company, hopefully someone will see what",0
"The drive through service is horrible. They gave me the wrong order and was told to wait. I waited  for over 5 minutes for them! The manager Maria Gutierrez (might have her last name wrong), FIRE HER!! After waiting for so long, I had to drive through again, only for her to lie and say she gave me my food. Very rude individual. Had lost all my appetite by the time I got the food!",0
"The manager who attended this Roanoke store was very rude, the ice coffee had no caramel flavor, the cookies ",0
"Delivery- complete joke! Don't bother taking the time to order sauces for your Nuggets! I ordered 20 spicy,  40 reg, picked out at least 9 different dipping sauces as ""required "" not to mention Desired by my kiddos!! We did NOT get ONE sauce or even a ketchup!!! Just to make sure they were consistant with disregard, they didn't even give us straws either to go with our $3 mango smoothies...2 of them! So, 60 Nuggets-NO sauces  AT ALL!  Not the first time they have done us wrong on the Nuggets so buyer should be cautious!",0
"f I could give it -5 I would. Ordered on their own mobile app so it seems like they chose not to read /deliver the order actually ordered. I collected , drove 10 + minutes towards home before the kid figured out that his order had every single add on we had requested not be added. I called and , zero apology,  was told to drive back to the drive thru and collect. OH-KAY. Lovely customer service already. I get there and the 'manager' asks me to return the wrong order, I handed it back (untouched) and he made  huge scene of firing it in the trash. emmmm, your mistake. No apology and ALL the attitude ? Never , ever again. Calling the franchise owner. I would hate this guy to represent my business . I felt so sorry for his team mates /peers who were embarrassed by him.",0
"The person who takes your order always seems to be mad, the cashier is never polite and orders are almost always wrong. Good thing other better places to eat are around here.",0
They canceled my online order even though I ordered it 40 minutes before close and was just turning into their parking lot. They still had 10 minutes to be open. I understand I퐉 skimming time but that,0
Good quick service! But the lady that works at night front counter is very rude. It's a way to say something. People are spending their money.,0
"Went through the drive thru in a hurry to get my daughter to school, we found a hair in our food and was given the wrong drink. The manager on duty was very apologetic and gave me a refund. Even though I was disappointed with the hair in the food, we were treated very kindly and had no problem getting our money back",0
The food is fine. Service at the drive through is horrendous. Unprofessional and unhelpful.  It good that ther,0
Very unsatisfied. My husband and i came to this McDonalds it was locked and we had to used the drive thru and they told us they were accepting cash only. We ordered and they told us to pull around to the second window. We weren told our total. We weren given a receipt either and we were charged $25 for some late night driving home snacks. Coffe,0
I went there today with no cars in front of me in the drivethru.I ordered one large Sweet tea it took over 5 minutes for them to get. I should've have just went and got a fountain drink from 7eleven. This one is always slow.,0
"I went to McDonalds this morning for breakfast and got charged for an extra sandwich so I asked for a refund. they refunded the cheaper sandwich which was not the wrong one and I pointed it out and they said I was wrong and they refunded the right one, I was like okay whatever. then they closed to door to fix my drink. they apologize for my inconvenience, smile and tell me to have a nice day, handing over my drink. I get to work and realize they literally only filled it halfway. I was nothing but polite. Petty does not look good on you McDonalds.",0
Third time in a row to get the hamburger happy meal with just ketchup only to have cheese added each time.  My child will not eat it if cheese has touched it. They have new toys for the kids however we keep getting toys that are 6 months old. Not a good location for the lack of service and food.,0
"I went through the drive-thru and ordered 3 cheese burgers. I waited in line for like 10 minutes. I get to the window and they told me to park because my food wasn't ready. It wasn't even busy, so I didn't understand why it took so long to make 3 cheeseburgers. After waiting in my car for 10 more minutes, I went inside to get a refund since I had to go back to work and I just wasted 20 minutes waiting for food. As soon as I ask for a refund, one of the employees walks up with my food and hands it to me. I guess they forgot I was waiting on it? I will never come back to this location.",0
"The Staff is very rude! Me and My friend were gonna order sonething over the phone. as we were waiting for someone to answer the phone, Me and My friend were telling Jokes to each other. My friend told me a joke and someone answered the phone. we didn  anyone was on the line so he kept telling me The joke. so about of No where THE MANAGER tells my friend 폮top prank calling here or I퐉 Gonna call the cops and send them to your house, I have Your Number? My friend tried to Tell the Manager that he didn know someone was on the line. but the Manager decides that he isn퐓e calling this Place back unless the Manger apologizes for being rude!",0
"I hate it when I point out a problem and the management tell me that that's the way its supposed to be.  I managed a McDonald's for many years.  I know better. I still order their food regularly all over the country.  I know better. The new manager has made things much better, but standards still slip back to the old ways when he's not here.",0
"I usually defend fast food joints, even McDonalds. Not a very picky person. However this visit to this location was very disappointing. Defying all logic it took a very long time to get my food around noon on a Tuesday despite few cars. The employees were emotionless and seemed to be rushing you through, even though it still took a long time. And then to top it off they got my order wrong.",0
"This people always try to rush you on the drive through and even if you go inside store, there are always problems with food, last time I went over there I had 2 cold cheese burgers, had to wait for my wife's food and came the wrong way. If you want to eat bacon, tomato and onions good luck trying to find them in burgers, there are just 1 piece to none hahaha.",0
"Really frustrated with this location. I usually go to the location off of Beach street and order the same thing every time I go there. I know exactly how much my order should be. I stop here because I happened to be closer to this location than to my normal one and order my usual. 2 McDoubles. I had just enough change in my wallet to pay for my order. Or so I thought. Instead of paying $1.50  2 + .25 = $3.25, I was charged $1.99 for ONE Mcdouble. It may not seem like much, but to someone who is on the go and on a budget I expect ome of the biggest fast food chains to at the very least be consistent with their prices. I wonder how much I've over paid at this location in the past!
What made me most upset was that I didnt recieve a receipt for my order. So in order to determine why I paid $2.15 after tax for ONE Mcdouble, I went inside to the self ordering in the lobby and looked it up myself. I dont appreciate not being told my total at the speaker, not beinzing I didnt even receive one to begin with when I pulled forward from the pick up window. It should be standard procedure to give a receipt for the sake of the overpaying customers.",0
"Food was good. Everything was right, but they never have any of the toys offered on the mconalds preorder app exept for what they call inisex, which is really just for boys, and were very short with me and rude when i asked for a proper toy for my little 2 yr old daughter. She is obviously not into a avengers.",0
"If I could give them no stars I would.. they have been messing up my order for year's. Remodel didn't help nothing,  still sucks. I've complained to a district manager,  don't help. I've had 1 nice manager,  but she still got my order wrong... I swear at one point I thought I was on boiling point, or there was a hidden camera. Cuz they got my order wrong 3x's in s row... this place is A JOKE....",0
"Got the buttermilk chicken sandwich and not even sure if there was chicken. Bit untonit and had a cold grey semi solid mass caked in flavorless breading. Fries were soggy and unappealing. Usually no matter what Mcds you go to you expect some consistancy, with this one in Roanoke you can expect consistent bad food. Stay clear of this place. Staff definitely doesn't care and to say the food is subpar would be a compliment.",0
"They watered their parking lot with a poorly-engineered irrigation syztem right before days of hard freeze,let everyone skate through the ice for a day before closing during the majority of the freeze when everyone needed a hot meal.
Whataburger stayed open and served a limited menu to support Roanoke.",0
"This McDonalds sucks. They recently had a remodel which means the inside is nice and they have the fancy double drive-thru, but unfortunately the remodel could not fix the main issue with this McDonalds: The management.

The management is either not training employees properly or teaching them to bend the rules to keep a good drive-thru timer, because you will always have to pull up at this McD's. Always. Even for perfectly reasonable orders at perfectly reasonable times (1 burger + fry at 3pm = pull up next to the 3-4 other cars already there).

The one manager I've had the displeasure of dealing with was rude as well. I had to go back due to them forgetting several items on an order (that I had to pull up and wait for more than 5 minutes for, no less) and decided I just wanted it refunded to my card. The manager was rude about refusing to put it back on the card and insisting on giving me cash. The best part? He made me pull up to get the cash.

So again: Mis-managed, terrible McDonalds. It's a franchise for a reason, this one just stinks.",0
"Honestly, I hate to do this, but the moment I walked in, it smelled like a porta potty... and I was like ""let me just order"" I ordered 2 hot and spicy's NO LETTUCE, a large drink and a large fry. The Coke was ok, the fries like always (not full but fresh) and I got one sandwich with lettuce and one without. I told the kid in the front ""this sandwich has lettuce one it"" which prompted him to tell the guy and girl at the grill to please fix it... they shrugged their shoulders and pointed at the monitor and said ""well it only says one sandwich no lettuce...""

I mean come on guys. The kid at the register made an honest mistake and instead of going back and forth with him, just fix the dang sand which! Don't sit there and argue. So the guy in the back snatched the sand which and threw it! At that point I asked for a refund.. little did they know, I speak Spanish. So when the assistant manager asked me what happened I explained to her and she let out this LOOOONNGG sigh... so sorry I am an inconvenience to you, but if you were to train your team members some customer service this wouldn't have been an issue. Jesus, the kid at the register was really nice and well mannered. He gets a 5 star. But my experience was just horrible.",0
"They seemed overwhelmed at lunch in Drive thru. Very slow. Then when at window was asked to pull forward when simply ordering a number 2 with nothing special added? Seriously, a quarter pounder takes extra time to make? Now I remember why I dislike McDonalds.",0
"I come here every morning for breakfast on my way to work. Ever since they got the ""Angry Bird eyebrows chick"" workin the drive through my order is always wrong. Not a little wrong like very wrong! Today was a simple order of a Coke and a sausage biscuit with strawberry jam. But she trys to give me a Frappuccino. Then after I clarify what I ordered again I get a Dr pepper instead of a Coke and then grape instead of strawberry. This is a everyday occurrence when she is working the drive-thru window. I even have talked to the shift manger and he laughed it off. I cant wait for the new Mc Ds to open on 114 and 35!!",0
Crazy manager at this McDonald's abusing customers. I've never been to McDonald's THAT HAS YOUNG latin Manger yelling at customer. I was surprised as he hanging out the drive-thru window and people just driving away.,0
"God is love, but this McDonald don't have love. Manager are rude and not professional. I order my food instead of her thanking me I thank her.  That's something Jesus will do. I will pray for her tho. I just don't think it's a place to relax and enjoy your family time.",0
Absolute worst service. The manager has no control over her employees. Absolutely rude and unprofessional.,0
This place is the worst.  It smelled like manure.  I had to go to the counter like 3 times before the order was complete. Cold fries and burnt apple pies. I didnt like this olace at all.  Next birthday for my grandson will be somewhere else.,0
Very disappointed with this McDonald's! I ordered a crispy buttermilk chicken sandwich meal and supersize my order when I drove uo to the window I paid my total and then I sat there waiting for about 5 minutes so I said to myself maybe they're cooking a fresh chicken so I didn't mind the wait. Well when I got home I took the first bite on the sandwich and let me tell you THAT CHICKEN HAD BEEN SEATING ON THE HEAT PAN FOR A VERY LONG TIME BECAUSE IT WAS LITERALLY HARD LIKE A ROCK AND IT WAS NOT JUICY AT ALL IT WAS VERY DRY! and then the fries that I got were overcooked every single one of them were burnt!,0
"This is the worst McDonald's I've ever been to. I've tried it several times, mostly because it's on the way to my work...but after today, honestly, I'd rather skip breakfast all together. I got a completely soggy hash brown, soggy all the way around. I got a small caramel frappe with a shot of espresso. They put the espresso on the bottom and just poured the Frappe on top, so all I got was espresso when I first tried it. To add insult to injury, they put it in a small cup and dumped the rest out (it should have been in a medium cup). I worked at a McDonald's for over 2 years and this one does not follow procedures at all",0
"I used to go to this McDonald's every morning for breakfast. The customer service has gone to hell and they haven't gotten my order correct in the drive thru for 8 days in a row. No one speaks English well enough to complain, they just look at you and smile.",0
"This McDonald's screws up 96% of the time! Tonight was the last straw. My husband ordered 2 large fries, 2 PLAIN McChickens, and 2 large drinks.....The drinks were great.....the rest was not even what he ordered and OLD. In the bag was a fillet o fish (which to my surprise was the only fresh thing), 2 medium 5 year old fries, and 2- 10 year old cheeseburgers...seriously, the cheeseburgers were so old the cheese was crusting. Where is the quality????? They don't care if people are upset and/or get food poisoning?? Granted my husband should have checked the bag before leaving, but he didn't think to (not surprised). I was definitely upset the order was wrong and said whatever and we were going to eat it because we basically got smaller fries, but an extra sandwich, but those CHEESEBURGERS were so horrendous that whoever put that order together should be fired because it was just wrong..meat and cheese was well past shelf life and the pics I upload will show it. Way to go McDonald's for providing POOR SERVICE yet again.",0
Urger buns taxted stale. Fries were little more than broken potato sticks. Absolutely terrible location!,0
"Ew omg, the coke is so disgusting, it does not taste like coke, it taste so disgusting, and they take their time like i don't have a 30 minute lunch ",0
Took my 3 year old here to eat and play in the play place. There was a homeless man sitting in there with his no socks or shoes on. Multiple employees walked by him without saying anything,0
"What's with the weak coffee?! The McDonald's coffee usually has a great flavor, this morning its like dirty warm water, weak and diluted! During breakfast lunch, unacceptable!",0
"I've never had a good experience with any McDonald's I've ever been to, so I usually avoid McD if possible.  My only visit to this McDonald's in Roanoke messed up my order.  I had ordered 2 hamburgers with no mustard, fries and drink.  I get home only to discover that the hamburgers did not have ketchup and onions, but were instead covered in mustard.  Won't be back.",0
Drive thru lady is awful. The service was horrible,0
Girl taking orders in the drive through didn't listen very well. Asked for 2 hashbrowns it was never added to my order. I said it 3 times.,0
Today they see me inside waiting for orden and no body attend me today 7/22/21 time 6:27 am they look at me 3 time and don't ask can I help you..and the male manager he see me and ignore me..I like this mcdonal I'm the truck driver I coming every day but this male is not good..and  I left with hungry..!!!,0
This is the second time I've been to this McDonald's and waited longer than 10 minutes with no service. Went at 2pm no one in line no one in drive thru. #poorservice #lazystaff don't even realize they being photographed while sitting at their table,0
"Very dissappointed today. Sunday breakfast, understaffed, very very slow service. Customers had to ask for utensils, cream, etc with every order. Staff seemed to suffer from inadequate training and nobody seemed to be hustling.",0
Ordered a Big Mac with bacon didn't get the bacon on it. Fries were cold. And the gentleman inside was spitting in the trash can ill never go back again,0
The ladies restroom smell horrible. Moldy and mildew-y smell. Very very strong smell that I could smell through my mask.,0
This location had me pull up to a number lane and wait for my food and NEVER CAME with it!! wth!!,0
Charged me for someone else who already drove offs meal. Then got my order wrong. Spent 20 minutes for fast food in the drive thru,0
"Order some food and they forgot to give me , my Cheeseburgers... I always check the bag before I leave. I told them and the girl said it was in there...I told her you want to come and check...",0
"The service at this McDonald's is always spotty, this time they made my iced latte a hot latte not a big deal but they consistently mess up the orders and I love McDonalds in general",0
We go to this McDonalds because they had a really cool electronic board that the kids could play on it was interactive and very neat well for the last five times they tell us the board is broke.. we only get a drink there I'm so we only go to for the play area and since it's broke my son has been very sad,0
17 minutes in the drive thru. . . ..just wow.. had the order incorrect at the pay window. . .food was extremely hot so that was nice.,0
The manager did not have all the equipment working the order was messed up and they did not have the option to do Google or Apple pay or take credit cards or scan anything on the McDonald's app.,0
"Twice I ordered the quarter pounder deluxe meal and when I get back to work to eat, no lettuce and tomatoes.  Come on!!",0
I walk into the store in Roanoke TX and the employee is sitting on the counter and leaning on the cups with his but touching them I wonder where else he's been sitting at maybe where the food is made.,0
"There worse ! Wet lettuce  or dead.
Fries or nasty burnt dried up 5.00 Sunday Sept 25.  Made attempt  to call management  but kept  hanging  up there phone. This restaurant  needs to shut down.",0
How do you miss a patty on a big mac? -_- First time going there too.,0
Horrible customer service. Manager is a very unhappy person who obviously does not want to be there.,0
Flavorless grease bombs. This chain in general has gone down hill in a big way.,0
Rude on the drive thru speaker and at the window the only postive was the person who  gave me my food. She was very kind and polite to me.,0
Sat in the drive thru for about 15 to 20 min because they were very busy and still got very cold food. Took the fries back. Very disappointed.,0
I was told to pull forward and park so I did and I waited for 30 minutes and when I went in to ask about my food they said they forgot about me. I got a refund and left.,0
The staff is rude. My orders are seldom correct. Management is indignant when you call with an issue.,0
They had no remorse for people person like me and decentcy come with more smell with people like homelessness in mcds these days we needed help. Tamn I hated with all passion . I better off save my cash.shes,0

"Avoid this place at all cost. I ordered a double hamburger (with onions, pickles, ketchup and mustard), but received a single patty hamburger (with onions, pickles and ketchup). When I called the store to inquire about this issue, the person on the phone insist us to return to the store for a replacement. It a 30 minutes trip for us. We obviously did not r",0
Ordered a 4pcs chicken nugget happy meal for my daughter. Drive thru worker never asked if I wanted chocolate milk or apple juice and never asked what kind of sauce I wanted for the nuggets. Smh! I'm sorry but a kids happy meal shouldn't cost no more than 5 dollars not no 7 dollars! Smh twice,0
"i came here at 1:06am after i had gotten off work, google says they close at 2am so it was plenty of time before they 폺losed? I went through the drive through and nobody responded so i pulled up to both windows and was ignored by three different people. Two women just sat there ",0
They always mess up orders or give you the wrong order.  Many times the orders or not like instructed. Not too happy with this place!,0
"They did not give me my complete order, I made 3 order  of chicken deluxe and my order was missing fries whet back to made a complain and they were yelling at me and husband, this is not fear to the customer. People should be aware  of this  Mcdonald at Broadway and check their food properly before they leave drive thru. Those staff there are thief.",0
"There was an excruciating 15 minute wait time for two simple breakfast sandwiches, and the place was empty. When checked, the sandwiches were actually missing the cheese.
While waiting, some filthy guy was exchanging $80 in singles for twenties. After he got done with his banking transaction, he actually spun around and walked right into me- talk about the bum rush!!
The true danger here, though, is when you try to enter. There is a welcome sign at the curb directing cars to enter into a single lane driveway where the drive-thru actually exits. A head-on collision waiting to happen.
Stay far away from this place.",0
"Very bad service, I don't recommend to go there. 30 minutes waiting for a order and nobody say nothing.",0
I ordered a Big Mac meal sized medium and a 10 pc; I got a double cheeseburger and actually 5 McNuggets. Got robbed for nearly 10 dollars. Never again.,0
They are very rude and have no respect for people they yell at you like you did something wrong then the make you wait for your order then they get the order wrong and the best part nobody there speaks any English burger King for me,0
"Terrible service through the drive by. They threw out food into the bag and it isn't the first time. I use to come here alot as a kid, but growing up it got worse. I hope their employees can have better customer service. And don't throw food everywhere.",0
Customer service is the worst! So unprofessional every time. Lunch menu is up and when I asked for a kids meal they said they only had breakfast! And their excuse was that the menu change by itself! They don give you your complete order all the time (always missing something)they rushed,0
"Sun Dec 11, 2022 at 5: 30am, went to pick up a order lady was being very rude telling me to get out of her drive thru when all I said was I have a order to pick. Very unprofessional.",0
"The worst. Attitudes. Cold fries..twice!!!! The clerk gave the cleaning guy my order in the middle of him sweeping the floor, to bring to my car. Unsanitary!!!
2nd time....the order was still wrong.
Food wasn't good at all. Won't be going back.",0
Incorrect hours!!!  I arrived at 5:52 in the morning and was informed that they still closed,0
Horrible service from the night shift manager .!! I would also love to speak to a distric manager.!,0
As a frequent customer of this McDonald I am furious that you have your workers working under a heat wave with no type of air conditioning. I walked in to order with my kids and had to take my order to the car and eat in car which was very uncomfortable with 4 kids bet way better than eating in a place where it was difficult to breath. If you treat your employees like this than this is the reason your customer service in this locate is poor. As a franchise you shouldn be involved in this type of business never the less in any type of customer service business. I will not be returning to this location as my money is worth more to other busine,0
"Number of times we've ordered from this McDonalds: 3
Number of times they've gotten the order right: 0

It cannot be spelled out any clearer. ""Quarter pounder. Absolutely nothing on it. No cheese. Just the meat and the bun."" It is so simple. Under normal circumstances I would stick around for them to get it right. But they have a steady supply of drugged out homeless people begging for money right there in the drive through line, so running that gauntlet a second time is downright dangerous.

So I get home to see if i can salvage this order. Pull the bun all the way off to start scraping fake cheese off of it. The stale, burned bun breaks (picture). I successfully scrape the cheese product off the top only to find there's another slice of fake cheese underneath the patty as well.

I give up. #FightFor15, indeed",0
This place is terrible managers have the worst attitudes. I was there around 9 getting food w my mom when she asked the lady to give Us barbecue and ketchup and then she said oh no ketchup and buffalo and the lady aka the manager goes ?don start with a attitude which one is it?nobody was giving  attitude but her. Most deff should Quit  if she doesn,0

"I went through one of the drive thru lanes last night, and waited for about 15 minutes as they only took orders from the other lane. I was not able to back up my car, so I went forward to ask what was up. When I got to the only window open, they said they were only taking orders from one side. I suggested they put up a sign, and asked if could take my order at the window, they said I would have to go through the drive thru again. I am not going here anymore for this, in addition to the times they got my order wrong.",0
"Young man at the order pick up was so unproffesional, direspecfull, .  The  Manager a lady was just  laughing while the young employe was direspecting me today.  racial motives.. Anyway!! I didnt  know what was funny to that manager!!  Security even came but wasn't able to do something.. The store employe (young man) was obviously trying to escalate the situation.",0
This Mc Donald is ran poorly. The management is nasty and they ignore paying customers. They leave the register to a guy that also has to take both in store and drive way orders. The fries sit out all day. I came home to cold frozen,0
OMG!!!  Last time I order 3 double cheeseburger  they look like they were sitting there for hours. So this time I ask the girl that I want my burgers fresh so they come up with the brilliant idea of putting the burgers and the fries in the microwave so they would be nice hot and fresh,0
This place is not good at all the manager Had an attitude when I went with my mom and a few friends we ordered our milkshakes and fries and when my mom friend asked for barbecue sauce and ketchup she realized that she wanted ketchup and buffalo sauce so she asked the manager and the manager said and I quote ?Which one is it? Then my mom friend looked up and said buffalo and ketchup I guess,0
This McDonald's is just wow. Some days you get good food the majority of times is just bad food. I ordered a big mac meal from them. When i got it the bread was old hard like it's been sitting there forever. The nuggets were old. Awful customer service. The majority of staff are pretty much children. There's no type of discipline or order in this place. If you don't like your job just quit it's that simple. But we're paying alot of money for service like this that's just obserred. This place needs new staffing management everything.,0
"My children find a dead mouse. I requested to speak with the supervisor.....made her aware of the situation.....She HAD THE NERVE TO TELL ME THAT SOMEONE (IMPLYING MAYBE ONE OF MY KIDS) MUST HAVE JUST PUT IT THERE.

I did not have a positive experience at  all its pretty sad i paid 10 bucks for food and got a back full of sauce and cookies and i keep calling them no answer i will complain to the head since manager doesnt know how to answer the phone sad.,0

I was missing 2 double cheeseburgers, 2 cheeseburgers, 2 fries and 13 tote cookies. I call the location to try to see what happened to my food and they kept putting me in hold, saying that they both checked my order and that everything was in the bag, did not try to help me at all and said and i quote ?my manager on the floor said they checked everything and that everything is in the bag?I was in disbelief that they wouldn even try to do anyt",0
This place is horrible! I walk in to get an order and they keep walking back and forth in front of me without asking me if I needed help. I ask someone if they could take my order and she ask the other cashier to take my order the other cashier totally ignored me. If they don want to take care of walk in customer then they should close the lobby I had to walk aw,0
One of the worst with service. I ordered a ice latte through the app for pickup. So I go inside I wait at pickup. Drink isnt ready and other people are waiting also. I mentioned to the solo employee I had a pickup order. She says ok then goes off to make other peoples meals. So I try to be patient stood there for like 20min and never received my drink. They never canceled my drink I left and was still charged for it. Also they never sent the 1 cashier who was struggling by herself no help.,0
That's just the worst McDonald's I have been to They have a lady there working at the  Drive-through window who have a real bad attitude And she also speak with bad languages She curses to my wife and also curses to all the people who went through the drive-through I did not see her name what she's the one taking the orders late at night You must have been 11 o'clock PM When we went to McDonald's but I will never in my life go back to that place to spend my  My hard working money,0
"They didn't take the order properly.  I ordered a cheeseburger meal with coffee. When I got to the pickup window they'd placed the order as coffee and cheeseburger only.  When I asked for the corrected order and was preparing to pay the difference they tried to charge me DOUBLE THE PRICE OF THE ORIGINAL MEAL.  AND ASKED ME TO PAY A TOTAL OF $8.00 and change.  I asked for the manager (Maria) who refused to give me her last name OR explain how adding fries fir a combo would cost me double the price of the entire order....

This store needs to be audited for poor customer service.",0
"Fries- soggy most of the time
Soda- gets bad constantly (Gave me seltzer water instead of soda)
Sandwiches- not bad except that they퐎e dry sometimes.
Customer service-nything else??After every single request instead of 퐓ould you care to try our new ___?",0
"A few days ago my boyfriend went to this mcdonald's to get us something to eat. I was excited, had just came home from a long day at work and was STARVING!!! Ready to eat, I took a bite, thought nothing of it, I then took another bite and look to see that I bit into a VERY PINK QUARTER POUNDER!!!!! So I grab my food, go to this mcdonald's and show them my burger was pink. They proceed to apologise and gave me a new one, I ask for gloves so I may examine this one. I do and find that this burger is pink as well, so now this is 2 pink burgers in total given to me. I tell them, they go ahead and apologize and gives me another... And yes, you guessed it, a third pink burger!!!!!! So at this point of course I am very much disgusted and appalled by their lack attentiveness of the food they are distributing to the point I ask another customer next to me if he had seen what I did.... I didn't want to feel as if I was picking but he agreed, he saw pink, so I finally asked for a refund and fresh fries and left. I will not support this mcdonald's again! IDK how to post pics, I don't see where I may be able to attach.",0

I had to point out the fact that I was waiting to be served. So then th",0
Possibly the worst McDonald's on the planet. Can never get anything right and staff act as if there's nothing wrong.,0
I return my order to them because It was wrong order I see the cashier after she take the order from me she keep it to re-use it for another customer it was the big breakfast. She was supposed to throw it in the trash.,0

"No to all of that.
Always a long line. The kids working the drive thru are always in a bad mood. Orders get mixed up and the fries toddle between not being fresh to being freshly made in old oil... I will stop there...",0
Always forgetting something in your order make sure you check before you leave drive threw,0
Couldn't get a simple order correct so had to wait.... Asked specifically for something still forgot it and had to go in and ask again.... And food was subpar McDonald's standards so that saying something it was at least cleaner than most also at this point saying something,0
No napkins? Make you wait at the other side of restaurant  for 10 mins from drive thru? Then have to go inside and ask for condiments and a straw? Get it together management is not run right!,0
The apple pies here were the worst. It was like biting into a regular apple. The only thing cooked was the outside. The inside was cold and the apples were hard. I went there 12/26/18 to get happy meals for my daughters and their fries were too hard to eat. I won't be going back there. I only went to reward the girls for cleaning their room and helping around the house for 2 weeks. (This was their choice of reward for good behavior),0
"Welcome to the worst McDonald in north Newark. I ordered a Big Mac meal and 10 PCs nuggets meal with both sprite; I received 10 PCs nuggets, 1 order of French fries, 4 triple cheeseburgers without (onions, pickles, mustard) and unsweetened tea",0
"With as much staff as was on hand there is no reason I should have waited longer than 30 minutes, but I did.
I was not happy with my order when I got it.
Nor was my body satisfied when it went down.
If you want to try this place knock yourself out!!!",0
Literally the worst McDonalds ever . Food always cold.  Staff is all illegal and no help from them about asking about promotions always busy both inside and drive thru have plenty of workers but somehow always a long wait . Rude workers even if you call asking about promotions they always hang up . Even with all that said they still have the same stingy services with uber eats . Cold half cooked food go somewhere else save your money.,0
"For the third day, I went to this McDonalds, which I frequently always come to this McDonalds, my daughter and my niece love McDonalds, so each time I place my order, I ask for a medium fries  with my additional order, and for the three days that I went, they were given me burnt fries.  I'm sorry but I paid a lot for my order to begin with, I'm not excepting burnt fries, especially three days in a row. Each time I asked for some new fries, and then they would give me good fries that were not burnt. Except for yesterday, I got my money back.  I ask the girl why was she giving me burnt fries, and her reply was that they didn't change the oil in which they cooked the fries in. The point is as a customer you don't have to keep excepting burnt fries, or anything that doesn't look right to you. You are already spending so much money to begin with ,to be getting burnt fries. Lately there's been lots of issues with this McDonalds, people have attitudes, don't have manners, they don't even say hi  or thank you for coming. I'll be taking my service elsewhere. No customer service.",0
Arguably one of the most incompetent branches of McDonald's that I've ever had the displeasure of going to. I spent 20 minutes waiting on a mobile order when I could have easily gone through the drive-thru and gotten it in 5. Absolutely ridiculous.,0
Their food taste like plastic. Very unsatisfied with them. They used to be good. But now it's like they don't care if the food is fresh or not.,0
Absolutely horrible! Not sure who the owner is but they should definitely get a new staff and get Mcdonald corporate to come in for training. The service is bad and so is the food. They give you what they want not what you pay for especially as it gets closer to closing time. Food should be available and fresh no matter how close it is to closing. Workers should understand that if they dont wanna work let somebody who wants to do the job. Not suprised at the amount of negative reviews but I am suprised that ownership and management does not take these reviews into consideration. Complete disgrace! Go a little further in bellevi,0

"**CHECK BEFORE LEAVING DRIVE THRU**
This place sucks always. The people on the intercom are arrogant and impolite. They always forget an item at the drive thru. Hate them but its the only place that is closest to me. The only reason i go there bcs my son just wants the happy meal so i have no choice.",0
The young lady working the driv thru this morning is sooo lucky im not the person i used to be just 7 years ago...besides the nasty attitude after her mistake the cashier proceeded to lie to the the useless manager Carla that looked almost terrified to address the situation ..karma young lady ...ill see you again,0
worst location ever! EVERY SINGLE TIME they screw up my order - and the customer service sucks! They퐎,0
Too much waiting seems like the staffs don't know how a fast food restaurant suppose to be run. On top of the wait they forget items that you pay for so make sure to ask for a receipt if something not right with this McDonalds please report it call and complain.,0
"Extremly slow. They need to have a better service this is ""fast food"". Have been waiting too long to order. They are not bad but they need to move faster. Not the firts time i come here always lije that even when they dont have nobody inside.",0
"Not Satisfied, after buying 3 Large orders of fries for $11.97 and was given large containers SERIOUSLY HALF FULL looking like Small or Medium sized fries. Very disappointed...",0
"This place I really dont recomend it if you are looking a fast service, deliciuse Chickennuger, and Fries. I dont see Macdonal is do en the fries as before, soft, salty, and hot. Everytime we whent there to give more chances to the place my fiance always end with his stomach sick. When that happened for the third time I said, "" Nop, we are not buy anymore in the Mcdonals, no icecream, chickennuger, or fries. Thank you for reading, this is Doll in a Restaurant. Shalom 占쏙",0
Can not even 1 star it was a horrible experience do two employees service took me a half hour just in line waiting through the drive thru then I heard a voice come over the loudspeaker and says drive to the window when I go to drive through the window that was for cars in front of me and the line did not move the worst visit I had to McDonalds drive throw,0
"i asked a lady to open the bathroom, and with a really bad attitude she said that it was only for customers, when I told her I WAS in fact a costumer, she replied with a 퐋nly for buying costumers?I responded ",0
It's my local McDonald's so I wish I could rate it higher especially considering they added modern stuff like the DIY menu boards and the 2nd drive thru lane. But what's the point of a second drive thru lane if your employees just ignore it like what happened tonight. Also while they have security inside the pan handlers in the drive thru lanes at night are out of control. Food wise things take a long time usually but it's your normal McDonald's type food except they don't salt their fries well.,0
Bad service long wait  employees are the worst,0
"This McDonald's has always been bottom-of-the-barrel as far back as I can remember, and a sleek face-lift doesn't change the fact that a visit to this McDonald's will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. The list of their offenses is too long to detail every one, so I'll compile a list:
1. Incorrect orders 50% of the time
2. Rude employees and managers
3. Customers who are loud, offensive, and downright violent
4. Poorly made, slapped-together food

And perhaps the most disgusting new violation is that recently they claim to have leased their parking lot to a private booting company, P.B.S. Parking Boot Service, and troll the parking lot for people who step off the property to boot them and demand $200 cash in exchange for the boot removal. It seems this McDonald's is doing everything to lose business. They thrive off of convenient location alone. Absolutely terrible experience.",0
"Always rude people in the afternoons or evenings, no sense of respect for others. Overcooked old food is served late afternoons to early in the evening. Completly discusting. Overall not a good place. Needs myor improvement on employees.",0
They can't get Uber eats orders right this is the third and last time it will happen again. They completely forgot 4 medium fries .,0
"All those renovations in appearance makes no difference if the staff is unprofessional and simply ghetto. Then again it is in Newark smh. I was not aware that this particular Mc Donald's was not a corporate store, honestly I wouldn't know how to differentiate one from the other. In any case to my understanding every Mc Donald's ran the same policy in regards to the food they sell, obviously. So when I go to get my coffee, everyone knows you are entitled for one free refill but to my surprise this Mc Donald's does not honor that. The person at the register who's name is Estella (mexican woman) was the one who took my order and made me feel real uncomfortable and awkward when I asked politely for my refill. There were others on line waiting to take their order and I feel like she deliberately embarrassed me. There was no need to make me feel degraded, at the end of the day I am a customer and I have no need to bring my business here. I should of took my business where I noramlly go which is the one located on Washington Ave, in Belleville. That just goes to show you how true the phrase is, ""Never judge a book by it's cover""!",0
this place is suck!!!!!!!! i had a delivery of doordash which i had to place but they didnt accomodate with me!! they were like thats for belville nj store!!!!!!! it was very frustrating at 10pm. then i had to go for belville store then couldnt find out. then i went back to the same one and got the order.,0
Very rude staff nasty attitude  I understand  people not happy with their job  but that dobt give them the right to be nasty..,0
Every time I go I don't get what I ask  and the some employee are mean,0
If only I could give less than 1 star!!! I swore off McDonalds long ago however I happened to be with someone who stopped in so I decided to get a breakfast sandwich thinking it would be hard to go wrong with breakfast... I got food poisoning for the first time in my 29 years of LIFE. A quite unwelcome reminder to stay far away..,0
The worst McDonald I have been to. Waited at the pick up window for awhile to be served ,0
"The day workers are very rude and disrespectful especially the girl who takes the order , I had the worst experience ever .",0
"This McDonald's is HORRIBLE. PERIOD. The food is always cold,fries soggy , nuggets soggy... And if you ask for sauce make sure you got it cause even if you paid the 50cent FEE you still might not have gotten it....",0
"They are advertising the new crispy chicken sandwich meal for $6, yet lied twice, once saying it was a mobile order, which is a lie, I took a pic, second that it didn't start, so why advertise, so sad, worse customer service in Mcdonald's",0
The employees at this location are ridiculously lazy. It's 6pm and the drive-thru menu is still on the breakfast side. It shouldn't take more than 2 minutes to flip the menu over to the lunch side.,0
"THIS PLACE IS A DISGRACE. THE WOMEN THAT WORK IN THIS PLACE ARE THE VERY LOW OF THE LOW. SERVICE IS SUPER SLOW, THE RESTAURANT IS SUPER DIRTY. AHH AND IF YOU GO IN THERE WITH YOU MAN KEEP HIM VERY CLOSE TO YOU, THIS WOMEN SPECIALLY THE MANAGER HER NAME IS GABRIELA WILL FLIRT WITH YOUR MAN GET HIS NUMBER AND YOU KNOW THE REST. THE WORST OF THE WORST. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST THE WORSE MCDONALD'S IN JERSEY. WHAT MAKES THIS MCDONALD'S BAD IS THE EMPLOYEES AND THE WAY THE HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THE COSTUMER. AVOID AVOID AVOID...",0
"Rude!! They close early without saying anything. They don't close 4 am they close 9. I waited at the drive thru for 15 min no answer , someone was back there just ignore the drive thru.",0
Very slow  they do mobile orders last even when you pay in app. They make you wait if go inside .,0
"Mobile order 30 mins ago. Came in once the app said pick up.

Counter: oh we just got your order. Wait longer.

2020 Logic",0
One of the worst McDonald's franchies around. Orders are often messed up even when given face to face. This branch is one of the few I go out of my way to avoid now.,0
I wish i can put 0 stars. The service here was so so horrible! SMH I don,0
Its incredible that a business like McDonalds can't fix things so simple like this drop ceiling....water damage with a lil bit of humidity could potentially become mold...something that could be harmful to anyone walking in here...,0
This is the worst ever too slow they are always on their cell phones instead of helping the customers. They almost always get my order wrong. When i went there bathroom was flithy .,0
Worst employees I guess it was manager at night shift very rude not surprised why people are giving negative reviews,0
I went in to use the bathroon before i go buy some thing and i saw i had to be  Buzz Inn so I went to the front to have me  to be buzzed in and I was told no I had to buy something first and the funny thing is I'm a diabetic and my sugar was high and I was in pain but I had to buy something first just to be let into the bathroom then when I was let into the bathroom it was so disgusting Know one clean the bathroom the toilet was filled with toilet paper and piss all over the rim of the toilet dry on u can see it and the manager that I'm assuming she had like a Jamaican accent and gave me kind of a nasty attitude also i wouldnt  recommend it  to come here and i was  visiting from upstate New York it was a long drive,0
"I travel a lot and MacDonald is my regular restaurant, and this is th worst ever place in customer service and food handlers.",0
"They are the worst.  Poor customer service, food taste horrible",0
Couldn't get a simple order correct so had to wait.,0
If I could give negative stars I would. I orders a number 3 large with no pickles and a coke no ice. Apparently that was like rocket science for these morons.,0
Very slow,0
"Terrible, I'm sitting in the 2 lane drive thru for 3 to 5 minutes & another car pulls in the other lane & they take his/her order 1st then have the nerve to tell me to hold on a minute. Broadway McDonald's North Newark.",0
They  hardly speak English they serve you Whit and attitude and they are always more concentrated in talkin about fellow workers that they are to take your order and that's why they always give you the wrong stuff.,0
The worstest McDonald's in all of America and they have a armed guard always nonsense there  cold food stale and hard nerve no sauces always mistake orders too many foreign immigrants work there drive thru  Is an half an hour late junkies asking you for money and Brittany is a chickenhead.,0
"The staff is rude and there no diversity in the staff.
I live in the n",0
They hire unprofessional people who can't even speak proper English. The workers are always forgetting something in your order. Ohh and the ice cream never works!,0
This store always gice me a hard time I don't like the staff at all,0
"The absolute worst McDonald in New Jersey , r",0
There are better McDonald locations then here. Usually 9 out of 10 times they forget something you ordered.,0
"I do not understand how the male supervisor with green locs who is working right now, still has a job. This is the second time I came to me and my children were mistreated at this location. Even writing this trying to remain professional is extremely hard. I went through the drive through on each occasion. He was rolling his eyes, condescending, disrespectful, disregarded my concern, slammed and locked the windows while I was talking?I walk inside to get an upper management personnel and her name was Roseline. When I asked her if she was above the side in the picture, she threw her arm out and said what happened. She walked away and disregarded my concern. There was a African guy with a coat on in the food are passed me the sauce and told me it was not his job to do so.. this loca",0
"Food was fine. But, when we came a large family were at the cash taking kiosks so we used a regular kiosk and waited to pay cash at the register. When the manager came to take cash they gave a look like we were crazy then said you ""you know we have a cash kiosk?"", to which I responded that people are at it. It wasn't overly rude, but execution was totally annoyed at us the customer. Hope it's not like that next time we visit.",0
"A disappointing visit. We ordered using the kiosk since no one was manning the counter cash register. We waited over 20 minutes for 3 standard combo meals and no one else was inside the restaurant. The people working in the back only worked on drive thru orders. While waiting, we watched as they cleared our order off the monitor without having served it. At that point, I asked one of the employees why our order was cleared and he responded that he didn't realize it hadn't been served. We were the only people in the restaurant and we were clearly waiting at the counter for something, whether it was food or a condament or napkins and they never even bothered to ask what we needed or what we were waiting for. The staff completely ignored us until we asked why our order was cleared without getting anything. They did make our order fresh once we asked for it, which is why I gave more that 1 star for the food. We would not return to this location.",0
"Drive through experience. Long line, no problem, tourist area. Took a while to take my order. When I paid, the person didn't even make eye contact, he gave me my receipt without saying a word except for the total and shut the window. Then, went to the 2nd window where the guy gave me the water bottle and sent me to the 3rd window. By the time I paid, at 10:02 pm, it was 10:20 pm and I was still waiting on anyone to come to the 3rd window. Then a female employee brought me a kid's meals and when I asked her for the rest of the order, she waved her hand and said ""I don't know"" with an attitude. She left and I waited 5 more mins before anyone came to the window. A male manager came and I explained what was missing plus to look at the happy meal that only had 4 fries, cold nuggets, no toy, no sauce, no napkins. When I showed the kid's meal, he said what happened to the fries? (as if we ate them). I looked at him and said ""that's what you guys gave me and to look at the camera"". He then said ""hold on"" and slammed the window. Another 5 mins go by, gave me the food and I asked where is the sauce and he said the 1st bag, but it wasn't there. As he was getting me the sauce, I told him this was the worst service ever and that I was going to put a review. He shrugged his shoulders, slammed the window and left. I then proceeded to hunk my horn very loudly to see if he came back to the window, but he never did.
I'm a store manager myself and I would never tolerate a behavior like that from any of my managers or from any of my team members. My 6 year old grand-daughter was in the car and was crying with this upsetting situation.
I visit this location at least 3-4 times a week, never had problems like this with the other shifts.",0
Not only was it packed and slow moving but our mobile app that said ready in 3-5 minutes actually tool close to 15 minutes. A BIG thing was having to pay to have a refill on your drink. That is ridiculous.,0
"I came to this mcdonalds to pick up an order for a customer as I deliver with Uber Eats and the manager refused to make the order because he said ""we are too busy and dont have the time to prepare such a big order, plus these are lunch and dinner items we will be switching over to breakfast in 20 minutes."" So my customer was cheated out of their order and I was screwed out of $35!!!! I reported the restaurant to Uber support as well as Mcdonalds corporate offices. Avoid this mcdonalds if you can. Terrible!!",0
"The food is always cold there's always a long wait time and some of the managers just don't care. One of them was mad I complained about my fries not being cooked all the way so he snatched them out of my child's hand and those were not even the ones I was complaining about, he then asked me if I had a recipe. When he was the one that took my money and didn't give me one.",0
"Absolutely disgusting, please tare this place down and build a Wendy with new  employees. I wasted my money. I urge you not to waste your money and",0
"First i'm looking at my receipt. I ordered two cheeseburger happy meals and only got a hamburger with one pickle on it. Then the manager tries to tell me that the drinks are dispensed on how you water them. I threw my receipt at him. I ordered a sweet tea and dr pepper
I was given a hi-c .

Untop of it I wish I can post a photo of my two orders of fries thrown on the groud because they were uncooked.",0
"Raw burger. Spoke with manager Nattie, she defended the raw burger saying it passed a temperature check. She reluctantly agreed to make a new one a took my receipt.  20 minutes later still no burger. Went to the counter, a girl there gave the burger to someone else. Another burger was made, but they ""lost"" the receipt.  While standing at the counter waiting for a receipt to be reprinted, I was holding onto my bag. A man behind the counter tried to grab the bag out of my hand. I told him ""hands off"", he said he was checking the order number. TOTAL INCOMPETENCE! I went to complete the survey on the receipt BUT IT HAD ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED!!!",0
"I had this same meal in Las Palmas Orlando, Florida and the difference was night and day.  Sorry should have taken picture B4 I started eating, but look at the pork and meat, that I didn't touch.  Never again",0
"I never seen a place full with kids employees..
no body care what you looking for.. rod customer service by rosalina.. she made you like you were asking for free food",0
"Complicated kiosk ordering, salty fries (can order lightly salted) decent but too much sodium in the hamburgers.  Good for in a pinch or for a quick bite.",0
This is the most Discusting McDonald I,0
"Instead of the manager (Isiah) helping my kids, he decides to send someone else so he can go converse with someone else. They were paying customers just like everyone else he helped. Thank you to the people that helped my kids.",0
"Sign indicates free item if the person taking your order doesn't ask about rewards. The Male taking our order didn't ask. We told them at the window. The manager told us the girl that took our order did ask us we explained that it wasn't a girl it was the man. To which she rolled her eyes,walked away and didn't return. We also didn't recieve our bottle water, napkins  nor straws for the drinks we did get.",0
"Lucky they even get the rating they do. Placed a mobile app order at 9:49am and was still waiting for 3 sandwiches 45 minutes later. Not a single person acknowledged me standing at the front counter, but had no problem passing orders out to those using the kiosk. Go thru the drive thru to be given the excuse that their ""short handed"", yet I spent 45 minutes INSIDE and seen plenty of employees. My order was wrong twice. Absolutely cold food. Sent a complaint to corporate because this is unacceptable. This location is full of tourist and I hate for these people visiting our state and area to be treated the way I was. Absolutely uncalled for!",0
"Food was cold drinks missing
The manager is rude the advertising is false. She accused us of lieing when we said we weren't asked about the rewards to receive the free cookie.  Very hostile !",0
Not satisfied with purchase. Female manager messed up my order twice. My tripple hamburger looked like someone added two miniature paddies on a normal size burger. I would recommend that this supervisor pays attention to receipts and ask for additional help in order to avoid mistakes.,0
"If I could I would give -10 stars because I stayed here in Orlando all week and they never wanted to take my order, they locked all the doors at night, they say they close at 11pm and for example I arrived at 9:40 and they told me that it was closed, please McDonald do something, this is happening to me all nights, Im from Mexico and I dont have a car or the App from here (even if its the same is different) they are rude and not attentive.

Asked for the manager for refil e he turn around and started to do another thing completely different. ZERO ATTENTION TO CUSTOMER. I",0
No one to take your order it's all done on kiosks had to have my ice coffee remade because they couldn't get it right the first time,0
"I understand the profit-drive to push automation, but it seems to not work here. 35 minutes wait for two standard egg McMuffin meals mid morning is unacceptable for fast food.",0
Lost our order. Waited 45 min for a burger fries and a box of nuggets. Then they accuse us of trying to get a duplicate order for Free. They clearly have problems.  We tossed a twenty dollar bill at them and asked for the food. NEVER GO to this location.  EVER,0
Nasty Shift manager and drive thru lady treat customers like a burden nonsense of customer service. Kitch n always Dirty. I definitely would not suggest coming here.,0
Ordered the curbside orders but waited around 20 mins since the staff totally forgot to take the meals out??? I ordered regular iced latte but got suuuuper sweet latte instead. Even got the overcooked bun on my muffin! Worst experience!,0
"Horrible! Management isn professional at all, a ma",0
While sitting down eating. A manager was arguing with an elderly gentleman. Very disrespectful. Will never got black again.,0
"Lst night the cashier wouldnt assist in exchanging a nugget meal for a nugget happy meal due to their broken kiosk misplaced the order. Neither would sell the toy itself to help a child get their wanted toy instead sold a seperate happy meal box! Coffe was cold too!

Next day went bck hoping to get a different experience... the guy on the floor was really nice and polite but the middle eastern cashiers.... not so much!!!! Im standing their waiting to be assisted but instead the latina looking and the middle eastern had a more important conversation of how to remove her nose piercing and how to clean it! Also she was manipulating her nose while at the csshier! So so disgusting!!! Grosss!!!!!",0
"Having to pay for a cup of water is outrageous. $2 for a cup of water should not be the norm. Who do they think they are, Nestle?",0
I ordered the 2 for 4.49 crispy chicken biscuits for breakfast and they gave me the 2 for 3 mc chicken sandwich and then when I asked the manager Monica.why was i charged so much for sandwiches I didn't order she told me that she was short-staffed and didn't have time to fix it and gave me an attitude.,0
this mcdonald's is not open 24 hours despite all signage and hours posted. an employee rudely shooed me away when i showed up at 1:30 AM.,0
"A clean place with a good airco, food is another story. Bread of the burgers is dried out, french fries were cold. No do not go here if you want good food",0
Horrible service !  Made an mobile order and it took forever  to be ready . I end it up leaving without my order and you can not cancel the the order thru the app. I'll never comeback on this location.,0
"Terrible service,we have to go back 3  times since they forgot my big mac   , bbq's
Sauce  sweet sour souce  ,and my large order  fries with only half full.  The last thing is herzelnut iced coffee  with none flavor that I have to dumped away after first dip.  The most important thing is The only one staff seems so mad at work. When she doing the fries,one empty fries bag dropped on the floor,she got so pissed  threw a whole bunch fries bag on the floor.  She seems the manager, no other staff dared to point this out. They all just keep silent and clean the mess. If you are not in the mood ,go home plz. When comes to customer service, be nice then . That is the priority of your duty and responsibility.",0
The lady at the drive-thru window was so rude and angry (for no reason) that I cancelled my order and drove away. The lady would only answer with one word answers and was not even polite. Drove to BurgerKing across the street where I was treated nicely and my order was completed with no problems or childish employees.,0
"Large capuchino???? The second picture with the flash light was other day, take your own review about it, IT IS A ",0
Person was very rude gave me the wrong order and the food was cold check the food back and got my money back,0
Made an order online. Arrived 15 later. The place was packed. We waited 50 minutes in the store for our food. We got the wrong nugget sauces. We were missing 2 LG fries and 2 LG sweet t's. The manager behind the counter was very rude to the customers. This place is a wreck.,0
Very rude!!! I came early morning today and no one came over speaker. I watched them hand the car in front me food out the window. But yet they paid no mind to me being outside the window. They passed by and didn say a word or even acknowledge I was there but yet several employees passed by and saw me. Even if you were closed despite sign stating 24 hrs the lease you could do is have some decency and say something. Really poor service. T,0
"Companies need to understand it's not 2020 anymore. The public is tired of your excuses. Be aware this location starts breakfast at 4am however during late hours they shut their systems down meaning they only take cash, and mobile orders are not accepted, and the mobile app is not updated to make yiuu aware of this. Maybe it's legit, seems shady though. If anything it is poor management. It is understandable to shut down system during slower times if need be. But you should have it ready to go by time your breakfast hours start, and the mobile app should not be accepting orders.",0
"Automated McDonald's don't expect excellent customer service, food is always mediocre.",0
"A Big Dog was unleashed in the restaurant. Seriously? I love animals, but I have some allergy reactions.",0
Asked for a large water when they brought my order to my table.  And she never came back.,0
"I GIVE IT 2 STARS because they were quick.But on the other hand,The fries were cold,and the burgers were drenched with ketchup. Told the gentleman to hold one moment and 5 seconds later a girl came on. Like give us a minute. I normally don't write a review and I hate to leave a bad one.But you would think because it's in front of oldtown it's hot and fresh. Just got out of the hospital wanted a warm meal.",0
"Waited 34 minutes to pick up our order, and of course it was wrong and cold. Poorly managed, I do not recommend this location.",0
"I have worked at a McDonald and I have never seen such disrespect, Lack of communication and unprofessional from a manger in my life. I had a Uber eats order and called 15 minutes before to make sure that it was able to be picked up and when they answered the phone I asked my question and I got hung up on not once but three times. When I arrived and have waited in the line the man taking the orders in the drive through said our Uber order would be ready at the second window. When we got there the manger told us no orders for Uber were available. When I asked if he could double check he said that we would have to go back in line and that he was busy. I understand if there is system issues but I ",0
"Couldn't even order. I was greeted at the drive thru with ""we're only taking one order at a time, there are 2 people in front of you, I'll get to you when I can"" so I thought maybe they were severely understaffed. After 20 minutes at the speaker waiting, I pulled off without ever being spoken to again, to find at least 6 or 7 staff members kind of just hanging out inside, surely not moving the drive thru line along.",0
"Most unprofessional and rude mcdonalds I have ever been to.
I recently went to this Mcdonalds and order 2 quarter pounders with cheese with no ketchup or tomatoes because I have an allergy and a large coke. When I got to work I'm happy that I checked it before I bite into it because it had both. When I called them and spoke to the manager I was asked my name and to come back and they would replace it. I couldn't make it back that day because I was at work so I called the next day and left them know my name and I was going to go by and get the replacement and they said that I was ok to pick it up. Not even 5 minutes later the manager called me back and told me that I couldn't go pick it back up. When I said the manager said it was OK the person that called me back said it was a different manager that I talked to and thistles manager said absolutely not. Which it was the same manager. Like how unprofessional and rude this mcdonalds was.",0
"Be Aware!

Always a problem in this branch! Either order is wrong, or missing key ingredients in burgers (like ketchup for example), or stale meat ingredients, or the high prices, or the 45 -60 minutes long lines, etc.. What broke the camel back for me was when some customers would skip the drive thru line and when speaking to the McDonald's manager, I was told there's nothing they can do about it. Very bad area to be in for sure. Ghetto employees and ghetto customers. Better to drive couple more miles either way on 192 than to come here!",0
Took 20 minutes to order then they messed up are order charged us for there mess up. Questioned the price they gave us a hard time just to get the receipt to prove them wrong. That took  another 10 minutes.,0

"We have visited this McDonald twice now using the drive through. It took forever both times - the car in front only ordering 1 or 2 items! First time it took around 10 minutes to order and then we had to wait for the food another 10 minutes.
Second time too",0
"Not greeted when entering, employees refused to acknowledge us while we waited to order just to be told by another guest that we have to use the kiosk. An employee walking to the bathroom confirmed this. Kiosk doesn't accept cash and touch screen was not responsive. Decided to go to drive-thru and waited a few minutes just to pull off and go to chick-fil-a where they still know how to serve it's customers.",0
"Raw meat! Dont go here, second time happened to me",0
"Kid wouldn't take our order with cash but took a single girls order with cash.

"The food is no good for you since I have found out since the last time I reviewed this that there is pork in their hamburger I will not be going there anymore I should sue them as what I should do I haven't ate pork in 20 years!!!! very disappointing, and you would think a big establishment like this could get turkey bacon or turkey sausage",0

"Don't eat here! Order is always wrong, takes forever, fries are cold and gross. Dining room ""closes"" at 11pm. NOPE! Really closes at like 8pm. Update the hours on your door!!! When we knocked on the door and pointed to the sign, THE MANAGER FLIPPED US OFF!

Cooperate needs to fire most the staff, all the managers, and get new people in there.",0
DO NOT GO HERE!  This was the most unprofessional treatment that we ever received by McDonald's. We felt like we couldn't even report it because we didn't have a name to call up the next day and speak to a manager he wouldn't even give us a name,0
Have to order by computer and no one to help. Asked for no mustard and crispy fries.  Had 6 worker's talking about a ring instead of just looking at me as I asked for help. Bathroom are nasty.  Won't go back again.,0
Insanely busy line around the building for the drive through out the door for walk in and order ridiculously busy customer service was friendly but order was wrong and took a long time to complete maybe they just need more employees on a Sunday morning my family is :-(,0
The drive through guy was super disrespectful and awful to deal with. We had ordered online and they said it didn't go through even though it charged us so instead of providing a solution he stood staring not saying anything. As well as when we got the food and asked if that was all and he rolled his eyes and said nothing. Absolutely one of the worst experiences in a drive through. 0,0
Lines longer than Disney. Staff walk around clueless half the time. Not sure if understaffed or undertrained. Corporate needs to come and take a look at this one or shut it down. Been this way for years now. Always the same. Always cash only at night.,0
Was visiting for a few weeks. Got coffee plenty of times and was correct maybe twice to three times.,0
"Used a deal at the kiosk for a free kids meal w/ combo purchase and when I went to check out it said ""Deal is unavailable"" & wiped out the order forcing me to re-enter everything and the deal code was now invalid. I get that they are for ""participating locations"", but if you're not a participating location, put up a sign or something so I don't waste my time.
The drink fountain was closed 'to keep the restaurant clean' according to the sign so I went to the counter and asked for a refill and the manager said ""We don't do refills here"". What? Seriously? Unlike every other McDonald's? You're gonna give me the saltiest fries ever and then make me pay for a refill? Again, if that is this location's policy, fine. But post a sign so that the expectation is set",0
"One of my favorite features of McDonald's for me is that I know what I can expect; offerings, flavors, etc.
This is true for this particular restaurant, however, it seems that being soooo busy (I guess excellent location) makes them impervious to concerns about customer service or satisfaction of their customers.

Running out of lettuce, running out ""of many things"", are management/logistics problems. Bad attitude, lack of courtesy, well I guess that problem is on us, the customers, right?

The two stars are for do providing the best breakfast sandwich in the market still, regardless of attitude and bad manners.",0
"This is the worst experience I퐒e ever had at a McDonalds. Waited in line for over 40 mins at the drive thru, then found out my filet-o-fish I ordered was automatically removed from the mobi",0
"I ordered cookies and chocolate chip then I went to pay. The cashier was very rude he didnt greet me, didnt look me in the eye, and just announced  the price with no manners such as please. The lady at the drive through just shoved the bag at us, no eye contact either. Training for the workers at this Mcdonalds is lacking.",0
"Just went to this location. Worst service I ever had! I was unable to process my orden with the Kiosk. After I couldn't make the order I was standing at the line and the employee said all orders needed to be thru the Kiosk. I told them I tried it and was unable to complete the order and I prefer (wanted) to do it thru cashier. Manager Jennifer was rude and said that if I wanted to do it with a cashier I had to do it via drive thru. To be honest, that is totally disrespectful and unprofessional. Where is the customer service or Customer Service satisfaction?? You can not force your customers to do only kiosk!!!! What about people that can't read??? Are they not allowed to go inside the restaurant just because they can't make the order at the kiosk??",0
"Self ordering stations inside offer a milk alternative for coffee and that's what we (thought we) got. Went through the drive through to be told they dont offer such a thing. My husband was in the middle of explaining the situation to the manager at the window when she just turned and walked away. My husband had to get her attention to finish explaining that the menu inside has it on there. She was slightly aggressive,  we left.",0
"Order was wrong despite using ordering terminal and salad had large section that was inedible, see the picture. Looked like the lettuce had been out of date for a month. Took forever as well!",0
"24 hours, it's a joke right?
I arrived from my trip at 3:00am today 02/26/22 and the cashier notified me to wait.
After 30 minutes without attending to me in the self-service line, I decided to check if there was someone to attend me and nobody came out or said anything.  It is a lack of respect.",0
They won't take my order I had to use the self serving one n they didnt take our food to the table as the number thingy said,0
"Fries were good and hot. I also got the crispy chicken  sandwich. It was hot but  seemed like they forgot to season it as it was very bland and basically had no taste at all. The only thing I tasted was the two pickles on the sandwich. I definitely will not get this sandwich again here. I have to say overall ordering the crispy chicken sandwich at any McDonald's is a major gamble. I have gotten it once or twice before when it was really good but more often than not it has not been good at all... Bland, burnt, dry, etc .. take my advice don't get the c",0
"My quarter pounder with cheese was old, cold and dry.",0
"Our order was incorrect. We ordered a Big Mac meal - with a large coke and a medium caramel frappe. We were handed a medium coke with the meal and frappe. When we said the coke was supposed to be large, the worker (Manager) asked for the receipt, which shows:
1 Big Mac Ml-Lrg
1 M Coke
Then she said: You have to ask for a large- We did!! She didn't offer to correct their error.
When do you ever order a large meal with a medium drink????? The fry was a large, but they were cold. The Big Mac was dry. I forgot why we don't usually go to McDonald's. Thank you for reminding me.",0
No contact with the workers till they delivered.  Basically you were ignored unless you yelled loudly for attention.  Very disappointed and will never visit there again. Remover the kiosk in order to give a one on one personal touch.  Even a good morning!!! GO BACK TO COUNTER HELP PLEASE,0
"There were people inside but they were closed, but they did sell food, only that I could not buy because I did not have a car. If they are open for take away they should not DISCRIMINATE someone because he does not have a car.",0
Drive thru is the biggest mistake.  They Assured me everything was in the bag.  And nope no 20 piece chicken nuggets ,0
"Horrible! Got home ordered a crispy chicken sandwich. They gave it to me on a plain dry bun, with nothing on it. Just chicken & bread.",0
"Worst McDonald's I have ever been to. The food was dry, we had to ask for our drinks three times and we had to ask for the Happy Meal toy. There was one helpful young woman working front cash, who got the last drink sorted out. But won't be back unless management starts checking in and doing a better job motivating employees.",0
"We stopped in for a midday snack since we were across the street at Fun Spot of America.  I placed a mobile order, the cashier didn know that.. after standing there for 5 minutes he finally said mobile order 1634.. I raised my hand and he slide me the bag. Never",0
I just want to warn people that they have a beautiful playground that you can see from the outside...but it closed. ,0
"Terrible.... 1st- no cashier, they force us to use the non user friendly kiosk.
2nd- why ask us to take a table number if you don't deliver the food.
3rd- 6 dirty tables.
Don't you forget they are many other fast food options....",0
"Says 24 hour drive through. They're always closed, shut down, doing maintenance, only cash, systems are down, or some other reasons why they can't serve the early risers. They shouldn't post on the signa that the drive through is open just to not serve anyone or have it on maps that they are open just to refuse customers.",0
Worst ever spent 45 minutes in line and then they never took my order through the intercom finally made it to the front they took forever to give me my order then get home to see a combo missing UGH then I call to complain and they never answered the phone!!!! Horrible management,0
I sat in drive through Tuesday night around 11:30 PM for 20 minutes and pull up to order and associate says sorry we are closed I explained to him that I had been waiting already for over 20 minutes and he mumbled something and said sorry the website says open 24hrs,0
It is unfortunate what I experienced in that place. A man entered in his wheelchair just to charge his chair battery to continue on his way.  and the manager of that store took him out of the place it was inhumane what she did with that poor person,0
"Hey, we just left this place. Had a big order - lots of people hungry after getting to town late. Among other things, we ordered 3 orders of 20 nuggets, 4 large fries, a bunch of dbl cheeseburgers and a quarter pounder. Know what we got? A drink we didn't order, an apple pie we didn't order, an ice cream we didn't order, and one 10 piece nugget. In a big bag that looked enough like one that would hold our order - our bad, I guess, but our not checking closely enough just doesn't excuse just not getting 40+ $ worth of food. And then they don't answer when we try to call. Absolutely terrible store.",0
The people in this place could not get any more Dumber. Made it a point to order by the number on the menu board and they still are able to screw that up. Super great place to visit if your intention is to go through the drive-thru then have to park and go inside and fix your order each time.,0
"They were very rude and food was cold. They refuse to let us inside and made us wait 10 mins for three sandwiches and when it was time to get the food two people were VERY RUDE. Next time I'm in town I'll never go to this McDonald's. They were slow, rude, and not friendly.",0
Food was cold. Cheese wasn't melted on burger. Is that all is that all is that all is that all after every item u order. I will tell that's all when I'm done ordering. Wow customer service is really bad everywhere these days.,0
Very bad so gross  didn't do clean up ,0
Went at night at the request of my son since we had a very long day of driving. Bad move on our part. Ordered a filet. It was totally hard. Not just the bread. The fish was a hockey puck. Very nasty. Had to throw it out. The fries were the back up....thank goodness for those at least!  We also waited too long on line but his nuggets and fries were okay.,0
This is the only McDonald I know that decid,0
"Terrible customer service.....ordered from the kiosk, was the only person waiting at the counter and not one person acknowledged me. To make matters worse, the manager was assisting in fulfilling orders instead of delegating her employees. While they stood and had conversation I waited 15 min before I received a ""Did you order?"" Not even the management acknowledged me....can't expect good service if the management doesn't know how to give it!",0
They never seems to get our order right . Thank God we always check our food and for some reason I always have to go inside and they get in an attitude. So we will not be returning nor recommending to any of our friends or family,0
I had the worst experience at this location. I went to the drive thru and only ordered 2 hamburgers and a small fry. I paid and pulled up to get my food and was given the wrong order. I let the associate know it wasn't correct. He had me pull up to the wait window to get my correct food. As I sat and waited time was just ticking by. After 15 minutes of patiently waiting I wanted my food. No one came back. I knocked on the glass and no response. As about the 10th car received there food at the window behind me I had to get out of the car and walk back to that window as it was late and the inside was closed. I asked where my food was and he said he was making it. I asked for a refund and was given my slip refund a total of 28 minutes after first paying. I went back in the next day to speak with a manager to let them know that this happened. I had my receipt with the time and the refund receipt with the time 28 minutes later. He said oh I'm sorry they're new. Terrible customer service and uncaring management.,0
"Service was trash, took them 20 minutes to take my order (no exaggerations... Seriously), can't even salt fries for some reason, and the employees weren't able to organize correctly. For example, at one point, there were three employees gathered around to fill one order. ONE ORDER!!!! Seriously??? I'd recommend going somewhere else then to spend your time and money here.",0
Worst MCdonalds experience ever. 40 minutes and counting and no order. Don't ever stop here unless you want to get extremely mad,0
"Waited in the drive thru for literally an hour. If we weren't trapped in line and had been able to leave we would have. They didn't give us any napkins and got our order wrong. The cashier said it's ""always like this"". Absolutely not acceptable. Especially for a McDonald's. Did they forget what FAST food means!?",0
Service was terrible wouldn't allowed to use the app couldn't redeem point wouldn't let us use gift card I think they were pocketing the cash they overcharged us and forgot Burger,0
"I'm sorry to give only one star. But during our visit were in the children's area 7 of 7 tables or seats are not clean. It was uncomfortable for me to sit there. There were many spots to see, unappetizing. if the area for the guests looks like, how is it in the kitchen. I do not want to imagine it. I will not go there a second time.",0
I placed my order at 7:33pm tonight and got the order at about 8:15pm.  I had to call to make sure they received my order. Apparently they either forgot or overlooked it.  Usually they would throw in a free item to make you happy..   not this place.,0
"This was the worst McDonald's I've been in. We ordered using the kiosk and  they had numbers to pick up and take to your table where they would deliver your food. We waited 20 minutes for the food and it was dropped on our table without any courtesy. The coffee I ordered was missing as was the cup for my husband's drink. He went to the counter to get it and they didn't believe him at first. My coffee had the label on it for what I'd ordered but it didn't have any sugar in it so I added one and stirred it, took a sip and got a mouthful of grounds. The egg and sausage mcmuffin was cold as were the hash browns and  the coffee was tepid. I assume it had been ready quite a while before it was delivered. Usually when I get this meal things are quite hot. The whole thing was pretty dissatisfying and put me off McDonald's for a while. The staff didn't seem to be receptive to complaints so I made an online complaint on the McDonald's website and we left.",0
"I placed an order about an hour ago only to find out that half of my order was missing. I called this location to let them know that I was missing half my order. The manager, Judith, stated that if I don't come before 4am them I'd have to wait until the next day to receive my order. Although I do understand that their menu items are schedule based, I think its highly unprofessional to turn their problem into mine. I understand that my items were not available after that time, but she was extremely unhelpful in finding a solution to the problem they created. I asked to speak to a manager and was told the manager is on vacation. The call ended with her stating that she does not have time to deal with my problem because they are ""too busy"".",0
"I want to apologize to anyone that I recommended this particular McDonald's to in the past.
This was the restaurant that I used to recommend to tourists when they were looking for a fast place to eat that was away from the Disney parks, but still close enough to get back to the parks quickly. At that time, it was worth it. The menu was cheap (or at least what you know to expect from a international chain) and, since it's a chain, you know what the food is gong to be like.
So, let's look at what you need to do if you are a member of a chain of restaurants. You need to set yourself apart with your service. This WAS the reason I used to recommend this restaurant. Sadly, I don't think they care anymore. The last time we went, half of the kiosks weren't working. One of the three that was, didn't print receipts. (This plays a part into why the service was so atrocious. Actually there was a lot that played into it.) Now, if you've gone to McDonald's at all recently, you know you pick your food at the kiosk, get a number that you take to your table, pay at the kiosk, sit down and wait for your food. Typically all of that takes about five minutes. Well, this day (and what I've garnered from tourists and locals, on many other days) the team at work decided they weren't going to bring the food to the table. That would have been fine if there was any indication ANYWHERE, but of course that would have been a form of service so that didn't happen. After about 15 minutes of trying to find a place where we could all sit together (only a slight exaggeration) we were told by other customers that were leaving that they weren't calling numbers and you had to wait at the counters.
Ok... So I go up to the counter and wait. We get our food 40 minutes later, and there were the obligatory mess ups that we had to get corrected. No big deal, we are used to this.
My in-laws are visiting and at this point I'm trying to figure why they haven't received their order. It dawned on me  that my father in-law doesn't have a receipt (remember the machine that wasn't printing receipts?).
The person calling numbers is calling the number on the receipt, not the tent number. Apparently, my in-laws food was ready in a master of minutes (amazing since that is all customized) and placed in the ""abandoned order"" area. If we hadn't said anything, they would never have received their food. The lady never once called a tent number. We told another person of the lack of receipt problem. That information never got transmitted to the person calling the numbers. When we spoke with her and told her their was no receipt, she asked us what the receipt number was. We had the tent card in hand and pointed at the receipt plastered on the ice cream machine, and she asked again for the receipt.
Aside from the travesty that was the most important thing a restaurant is to do, the place looked like a slightly cleaned up version of a break room at a local dump. I'm not sure if they just didn't staff well on this shift, but like I said, I've talked to a few tourists and locals and they all say it had been this way a while.",0
"Hands down the worst McDonald I퐒e ever experienced. Rudest employees. Lady in drive-thru looked like a manager and was infuriatingly rude and just a horrible person!! The young girl at the register refused to acknowledge me turned her head and walked right by as I tried to ask for help! Other people ordered, ate, and finished there food while I stood there unacknowledged for over 10 minutes waiting for 2 double cheeseburgers and a fry. A guy was just leaning on the counter doing nothing and walked away when I said I could not wait any longer. Never got my money back a",0
"The only reason that I stoped to buy at McDonald's was because of my youngest daughter. But what we experienced today put an end to it. The employees at this location did not maintain an order serving  customers in the drive thru area. As you noticed, there are two lines in the drive thru and they are supposedly serve in a first come first serve basis but that was not the case. The associate, instead of been polite, talked to us in a not too pleasant tone. I did not wanted to make things worst so we placed our order and moved on to pay and pick up. Luckily the manager was close by and had the opportunity to address the experience. I hope they take this opportunity to improve their customer service skills and provide customers a much pleasant experience.",0
"Really slow service, took over 15 minutes to receive the food,  after it had been delivered to another table.

When it did arrive, the chicken and burger were cold. Duly sent back, to be fair they were remade and brought pretty quick, but no apology.",0
Take the extra 5 minutes to go to a different location!!!! My entire order was incorrect and stuffed into one bag which broke 2 seconds after it was handed to me. The person who took my order was more interested in rushing me then looking to see if it was correct. Went inside to speak with a manger and turns out she was the one who bagged my order! I then got screamed at by some young wanna be Rico suave who should퐒e been in the kitche,0
"I stopped here yesterday for a quick breakfast on my way to work. I got a bacon, egg and cheese mcgriddle, the hash brown and a caramel frappe. I ended up with food poisoning ",0
"Ridiculous.. i am not one to ridicule, this is pure ridiculousness... I should not have to check behind people that are begging for higher wages and they can't even get a kids meal right... you forgot the nuggets and I also ordered fries and apples... I received  double fries,  no nuggets, as well as missing the sauces that were to accompany the nuggets. I tried calling when I arrived back. No one answered the phone!!! Here is your negative review that could've been rectified with you answering the phone to address these issues",0
"Slowest McDonald's I have ever been to in my life. Took an hour just to order in drive thru... Then took another 20 minutes just to get our food (orders 2 burgers, apple pie, and 20pc nugget so shouldn't have taken to long at all",0
"Busy, under staffed, slow service, condiment stand a mess, out of lids, ketchup dispenser broken.  I ordered to eat in and my food was delivered to my table in a to go bag!  Why take a number and have an associate bring a to go bag to the table????  Very,  very ill-run and poorly  managed location.  Just  awful.",0
I should never have to wait more than 5 to 10 minutes for fast food. Waiting for over 20 minutes in the line now and I still haven't gotten my food. I understand this is Midsummer but they knew this was coming before hand. They should have the staff and the facilities to handle the business demand. This McDonalds sucks,0
Unnecessary long wait time in drive thru. Drive thru is built for double cars and double pick up windows but still stayed behind 4 cars for 30 minutes. Only waited due to long drive home with kids in the car. Rude staff as well. Really wish I had noticed the Burger King across the street earlier. I would have even settled for checkers across the street and that's saying a lot because I don't think anyone willingly eats at checkers,0
"I have ordered many times from this mcdonalds, how do you screw up a cheeseburger? I asked for no ketchup, no mustard, no pickles, no onion. I got no condiments and NO MEAT! I mean really, learn to read and pay attention. This is my 3rd time this has happened.",0
"Extremely rude and impatient. I asked for 3 water cups with my 40$ meal and I got a glare and only one cup.  Then my brother who ordered a 20 piece nugget went up to ask for sauce because they didn't include any that we asked for, after waiting patiently and then asking several times he got 2 of the 4 he asked for.  He came back frustrated with only 2 so I told him to go back for more. He asked the manager 4 times to her face very nicely for 2 more and she just looked at him each time and went the other way. Eventually a kind fellow customer next to him reached over the counter and just took sauce for my brother. Not impressed",0
Double check your orders. I got someone else order and when i took it back. The employee placed it back to give it to someone else. I told her I touched the burger to throw it away. She looked at my face and lie that she threw it away. Horrible attitude from the cashier. Order was not completed.,0
Female cashier was rude and was very unprofessional. If you are a tourist and don't know when it is cash only you don't get a receipt do not yell at the customer like we supposed to know what is going on. The only good thing about going was lemuel he was a great help. I would not want the girl to serve us with that attitude.,0
"Long line at kisok, which was only way to order due to lack of staff. Difficulty using my coupon since ordered from kiosk. Tea was weak, had been sitting awhile. Terrible experience",0
"Worst customer service ever!! I was invited to come in after having to wait over 45 minutes on the drive thru. Manager Priscilla calls me to apologize and invites me back with my family, I explained I cannot come back next day, but would come following Sunday, she agreed and hung up. On Sunday I come to the restaurant and there is another manager Cynthia who I explained the situation and she grunted the whole time she took the order. While on the service line, she tries to contact the manager and right there from behind the line, she asks me yelling, what is your name, I tell her and again in front of EVERYONE, other customers included, yells again, ""she tells me you came in already!!"" I replied NO, at this point I'm embarrassed and upset and I hear her that she tells the person on the phone I already put it down. Twenty minutes later, I finally get the order. I ask her to change the fries on some of the things that were ready because they were cold. The manager grunts and agrees to. After my family were done with their meals, we had ordered ice cream and we asked to hold off until we were done. When we returned, we asked for the ice cream and we had asked for chocolate, they said that we had ordered vanilla and the manager gave us one less of what we ordered. Incredible! Bottom line, we were invited to come back to make it up for bad service and McDonald's came through, we got yelled at by the manager, embarrased, long wait for food, missing food items, and pissy attitude by staff. Next time I get invited back I guess I gotta read the fine print or ask for what am I invited to come back for. Sorry that we don't have negative stars because this location would take them all.",0
Only go here because it's open late. Food not always the same presentation or great tasting..but it is McDonald's. What do you expect.... You know when you go there what you're getting. Cheap food..poor customer service.. And maybe your order correct.,0

"All I had was a hot fudge sundae, which was good. The restaurant did not have running water at the time though so I was unable to wash my hands in the bathroom or to order a soda. They legally should not have been open. They were still running things as usual though.",0
"Showed up 20 minutes before the menu change and was told I couldn't order what I wanted off of the advertised menu. When I question that to the employee they basically said they were too underpaid and lazy to make me chicken nuggets and all I could have was the two mcChicken sandwiches they had left... Or nothing.

Great customer service... NOT",0
"If it were possible to leave 0 stars I would. Absolutely zero customer service. The only interaction with both guys at the drive thru was when the order was placed, neither of them spoke a word in person. The guy at the payment window was too busy talking with the guy who would be the person to push the food out of the window and he couldn't be bothered to tell us which of the 2 pick up windows to stop at. I would say that the behavior could have been excused if they were busy, but they weren't at all. Yet even being busy doesnt excuse the gross lack of basic human interaction.",0
"As usual the food prep people don't know how to read a order slip. Big mac no sauce no cheese.
What did I get? Big Mac cheese ONLY on it.
Ya'll did make it thru first grade so you could read simple 3-5 letter words? Right?
Just asking.",0
The manager Judith is extremely rude. She gave us cold meals we said excuse me she looked at us and walked away. 6 minutes later she came back to me after leaving me standing there just stared at me and I told her 폠퐉 sorry my food is cold?she turned around grabbed me a new wrap handed it to me and walked away. Never saying a word. We had a second order and still had to wait. It is ,0
Just horrible service.. this is probably my first review ever and sucks it had to be a negative one.. if you don't like your job then it's best you quit without bringing down the company with you.. lady in the drive thru window at this hour was making fun of patrons trying to order and I happened to overhear. Not something you want to hear when ordering to be honest,0
There is a theme with drive thru only restaurant's cold food and watered down drinks and if don't check your bags well enough before you drive away and your order is wrong you can't just walk back inside and get it fixed you have get back in line and start all over again! Open up the lobby people,0
"If Mc D thinks Kiosk service is the future, I would SELL My Stock!
Probably the Worst Mc D experience I have Ever had...",0
This place is ridiculously high compared to the McDonald's just down the street. $20 for what is normally $10. On top of it didn't even ask if I wanted any sauces with my chicken McNuggets. Do yourself a favor and drive the extra couple of miles to any other McDonald's,0
So disappointed... I entered this restaurant only to be confronted with a computer taking my order..  which was Not working!! No one noticed we were having difficulty.  So frustrating. Wont come here again for a long time!,0

"This location has slow service and horrible customer service.  The computer order machine was not working,  instead of informing custmers they said nothing. Orders were backed up and the staff acted like nothing was wrong. What kind of training is McDonalds giving their employees.  For such a big business  and being involved in so many charities you think , they would emphasize excellent customer service. McDonalds you are slipping.",0
This McDonald's was the worst i haver ever been in.  ZERO STARS. Floor in entrance was flooded. Bathrooms disgusting. Soda bar dirty and filthy with no ice. Garbage cans over flowing. 12 to 15 people inside with one person working the register. This after sitting in drive through fir 5 to 8 minutes without moving.,0
What is the point in having employees in a store if they don't help you? The employees talking to each other and when you want to place an order they tell you to place it on the machine. The store was empty! What are they there for if the machine is going to take your order? They are getting paid to chit chat? Bad customer service.,0
"Thought it would be a standard mcd however after placing our order and putting the table number for the meal to be delivered to us, it wasn. We went to counter to find part of the order sitting there then we were given the order with a lot of items missing",0
Got the order wrong. Went back. They told me to pull up 2nd window.  They forgot me. Then got the order wrong again.,0
If you like to sit in the pick up line for 20 minutes and when you finally get your food it is not at all what you ordered then this is the place for you.,0
"Credit card processing down, it happens. But let me know instead of telling me  after 45 min in line. Sharpie paper and some tape .",0
"The facility is a contemporary fast food restaurant with self ordering stations; making orders fast and reliable. Notwithstanding, the manager needs to work in interpersonal tact with her staff. Ultimately, the store next to McDonald gives customers a ""free gift"" if you bring your McDonald's receipt.",0
"Food was decent until I found a tooth pick in my fries , unfortunately there wasn't anything I can do or say since I was just passing through on vacation from Chicago",0
"Spent 15 minutes in the drive-thru,  most of which was sitting at the window waiting for my food. Didn't get a straw, my double cheeseburger had no cheese and my son's happy meal had no toy. All I ordered was a a double cheese meal and a happy meal and you couldn't get either one right even after a 15 minute wait. Completely unacceptable.",0
If I could rate a 0 I would. I didn't even get my order because I had to wait so long. What fast food experience EVER!,0
"The staff here is not friendly at all. Where I grew up, you greet somebody, or at least say something. The drinks tasted horrible.",0
"Absolutely Terrible Food ! No OPTIONS for Anything even remotely Healthy,  The staff is polite,  but McDonald's You WILL continue to lose business!  People are finally looking at All the disgusting ingredients that's in the production of your food. Even the yogurt has MORE SUGAR THAN A SUNDAY , I wouldn't even recommend the fries , Unless you want a Heart attack , with  a side of High blood pressure and Diabetes with a POSSIBLY of cancer, then okay go for it .",0
"Absolutely the worst service! They ""can't figure out the mobile app orders"" when asked how to fix issues with long wait times the ride staff just says ""what do you want me to do?"" If you like people being rude to you and very slow service this is your place to not eat!",0
Seems like the more one goes to this location...the worse it gets....toasting an English muffin should not be a difficult task... it wouldn't be bad....but lying about toasting it .......Shame on them.....apparently after a certain hour it is..not a priority to make decent food for the public......or decent fries...not to mention a double cheeseburger... simply gross.. Good grief....this place is certainly disappearing from my list of quick stops...to keep going by  cause Checkers is right down the road...,0
"Very busy. Very dirty. One cashier and at least 10 people working. Line was long, the boy taking orders was moving at half the speed of smell.

I watched four groups walk out. We should have followed.",0
"I have been staying at the Holiday Inn next door to the McDonald's for four days now. Every morning we walk over to McDonald's to get bacon, egg, and cheese biscuits and hash browns. EVERY SINGLE MORNING that we've went over there, we have gotten hard, rubbery, cold, biscuits. Their hash browns are hard as well, and there is so much grease that it runs down your fingers when you pick it up.

I called the manager and she was very polite and replaced my breakfast with ""better biscuits"". However, the replacement biscuits were undercooked. They were very doughy. I do not recommend this place to anyone. The convenience to the hotel is not worth the terrible food.",0
"Just went and got 4 McChicken, 1 Large French fry a medium one and a cheeseburger.

The entire order was old. French fries were saggy like and old lady titis. The McChicken tastes like they were cooked a month ago. Aaaah wait no coke because the machine was down. First is the shake machine and now the coke. Come on man. Worst MCDONALD Ever fuuuuck",0
I visited this McDonalds on my way home from Walt disney world with my kids 8 and 13. I went through the drive through so I could get back on the road to get home our order was not right onions on everything we asked for no onion and short a French fry. Also has no ketchup in the bag and I asked for more because our kids use a lot and was told no it was in the bag. I do not recommend the drive through.,0
Horrible service. General manager was in the store at the time. Was punishing an employee in front of everybody. Should've been more professional and took him in the back area. I waited 10 minutes no one in front of me and no one in the drive thru and my food still was not fresh. Don't recommend this location unless you can't get to a different location.,0
"Very busy,  mad customers, long wait times for orders.  The staff is trying their best but can't keep up.  They need a new streamlined process and only one conductor.",0
"I guess when you're in a tourist area you don't have to worry about pleasing your local customers for return business. Stale burger buns, cold and burnt french fries.  Medium fries box was about 2/3 full.  Drive thru employee didn't say two words to me beyond the price of my meal.",0
I went through the drive-thru at this location and ordered a big Mac a large fry two McDoubles as well as a medium caramel frappe however when I return to my room the big Mac was missing as well as the cookies so I drove back up to the location I've now been sitting here over 20 minutes and nobody has come outside to let me know what was going on I would highly recommend finding another McDonald's to go to seeing as they don't seem to care about their customers,0
"The worst McDonald's I've been to! Went in around 10 maybe 11 at night after visiting disney on the way back to our hotel. Went inside because the drive through line had at least 10 cars, no big deal. I was ordering a carryout. Anyways they forgot the chicken nuggets for the 10 piece chicken nugget meal. I wasnt about to bring my two little ones back out so I called the store. I told them what had happend and said I would be back sometime tomorrow afternoon and to just get it then (my boys love McDonald's) she said that would be fine and she would be there the next day. I asked her name but it couldn't really understand what she said because she was talking fast. Anyways I go back the day and told the lady at the drive through what happend, she didn't know what to do and had to get a manager the manager comes on and asks who I spoke to and I told her I didn't remember but she said to bring my receipt in and she would take care of it. Manager didn't believe me. I ended up just buying another one and I know its literally only a few dollars but it was the principal.",0
"Quarter pound CB although made correctly with no onions was raw in the middle (not noticed until my husband was already almost done eating) then he just threw it away, hopefully he does not get sick. Kids meal CB ordered with no onions (not rang up that way) was covered in onions! Lessons here: cook outs not being done to make sure on quality & not serving raw product & cashier needs a little more training....because when I ordered my CB kids meal with no onions & a Large diet cook as the drink. He did not put on there the no onions & then asked me what did I want to drink.",0
"It's really ridiculous that I'm coming every day for my breakfast at this branch and they don't care about customer satisfied, every morning I ordered 2 hot coffe and they gave me cold one! Again and again it happened",0
"If I could give it NO STARS, I would!!  We waited MORE then 20 mins (inside) for our breakfast!  Ok. I can see if you are that busy & need to make the food...after 30 minutes we got cold food & the hashbrowns were so dripping in grease (and cold)....disgusting!",0
"Morons running the restaurant. The $6 meal is a rip off. We asked if we could get the same deal but sub a side salad. They said yes then they over charged us and yold us ""oh no substitutions."" Watch your tickets and repeat your order three times so the cashier and shift supervisor understand what you actually want.",0
1st night in Orlando in vacation. Drive thru was packed so we went inside. Waited for 10 minutes and manager said lobby was now closed and we had to leave,0
"The girl who takes the payments is SO RUDE! If you hate your job, look for something else or at least treat people nice.",0
This is quite possibly one of the worst mcdonalds I have ever been to. Multiple times we have ordered mobile and whenever there is an issue the manager on duty blames us. He even felt the need to come out to my car and berate me over it.,0
"During the Daytime its alright, but at night they block one of the entrances with trash cans and lock the other one. (EVEN THOUGH THE SIGN STATES 24HR DINING ROOM) So you're forced to drive through. I didnt expect much but whatever....",0
The hours say they are open at 5:00am but it's 5:30 and the doors are  locked. I have been waiting for half an hour and still not open only drive thru I don't have a car so thats not helpful.,0
"The food is good and the children's recreation area is very good but there is no supervision of any Mc Donald's staff to ensure that the play space is respected for children under 3 years of age. Big kids get into their space, push them, step over them and step on their parents do nothing or Mc Donald's. I never back with my kids",0
"An abysmal excuse of a restaraunt, this location is a McDonalds only in name. With a wait time of 10-15 minutes at best for even the simplest order this location completely and utterly fails in its purpose as a fast food location. I strongly recommend any reader to take their time and money to ANY other location.",0
"I퐉 assuming this is the McDonald on celebrations so that I write this review under the correct McDonald on Celebrations...Manager name with a J I think it Jasmine or Judy I think it Judy but young lady was not professional(she is blonde and worked around 11pm 08/04/18).. I ordered my food in drive through when I got it the food was not good the meat was burnt, the bun was hard , the sandwich basically looked really old.. I came in told her the situation not once did she apologize for the horrible sandwich... I had to ask for a new sandwich to be made instead of her even suggesting it...she took the sandwich food preparation ..horrible food poor management needs to do better !!! Took my money and went else where..this McDonald will no longer be geting my service ",0
Went inside...nobody even acknowledged us. After 10 minutes we went through the drive thru and got our food only to get the bag with all of our fries put in upside down. Real nice.,0
Service slow. Manager was rude to everyone including girl on register. All 20 nuggets were cold along with the fries. When they didnt give me sauce rhe manager told me to wait even longer for her to get them.,0
"For kids its probably nice but adults running through or driving through for a quick bite you have to basically explain what you want on your burger. Ordered 2 mcdoubles with cheese and 2 small fries and they were so dry they were kinda crunchy without cheese or even fully cooked. Had to trim off parts that were either undercooked or too hard to eat. And with burger being so dry its almost like you need a medium drink to even eat the burger, and sadly I started with the fries. And to top it all off after using a card in the drive through i never got a receipt. Never going back. Would rather go to checkers across the street.",0
Google says 24hrs drove up before midnight and lights were shut up. Multi billion dollar company but can't update Google hours or train their employees to speak and communicate.,0
I am visiting Disney and staying in a hotel up the street. Have come here twice after leaving the park between 11-12:30. Each time I have waited in the drive through for over 15min just to place an order and then another 20min to pay/get the food. Only reason I don't leave is nothing else is open.,0
"The price is good using the McDonald's app with the dollar coke, what is the point of giving free French fries when they are cold. They were absolutely been trashed. Customer service was good this time.",0
Ordered mcdouble bundle no ketchup light onions and extra mustard I got cheese and pickles. The fries were terrible and my drink was fine.,0
"& then they complain they get paid min wage. I'm aware this is a fast food place, so I don't expect to be treated like royalty, but the service here is extremely slow. The staff have no customer service. Avoid this place, unless you are literally in love with waiting",0
The never has the coke icee.,0
I work at Ponderosa Steakhouse next door to this McDonalds. I have visited this location many times. When there is no business and its slow the workers just stand around talking like nothing going on. I've tried to place my order many times in hopes that I'd receive my food fast enough to get my food and head to work next door before I have to clock in and start my shift. The management is slow and doesn't help out as I figured they wouldn't. My mother went here as well after dropping my off at work to only experience this as well. Many people have to wait foreverrrrr just to get a simple order. The last time I went I just ordered an ice coffee French vanilla and instead of handing me the ice coffee they placed it besides a counter and made me wait 12 minutes for it. I didn't ask anyone this time because im just feed up with this location. If you want McDonalds DO NOT! and I repeat DO NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION!!! They care more about drivethrew then there customers eating inside or taking it to go!!!!!! I'd rare this place 0 if I could.,0
Was given completely the wrong order after having to wait more then 10 minutes for what should have just been 2 burgers and fries. Called repeatedly to explain the error and got a busy tone every time.,0
"This is by far the worst McDonald EVER! The lobby was completely packed with people and they had one person on front line, they also made the food too early so by time the customers got their food it was cold and the employees were singing and goofing around and not doing their job, and it was very unprofessional! Finally the McDonald were short handed and the drive thru line was big, and they were extremely slow and it took them 20 mi",0
"Very bad service. Theirs always a problem, to many workers not enough service. Too much hanging out like if their high school kids,  and they always have you wait in the parking lot for something,  and when it arrives they still forget something.",0
Slow as he'll and on top of everything I was missing food. After all the waiting. Never responded,0
The worst McDonalds ever! After standing in a backed up line with one guy running the register who had no clue! A manager finally steps up to help and still the line remainder ridiculous! I started watching people just walkout because of the wait. This McDonalds is in a prime location and you would think they would be better prepared. Chick-fil-A is a block down the street and has a smaller parking lot and they never have the problem this McDonalds does.,0
"The worst mcdonalds in any country I have visited. Food is ok, but the service was awful! There were more people queuing to complain than there were people sat in the restaurant. Staff were slow and not interested. Took over ten minutes just to serve some fries!",0
"Terrible service. Manager laughed in my face when I told them I was not satisfied with my food and service. I ordered the big breakfast without hotcakes. The eggs were old and half the portion that I normally get at any other location, the soda was flat, the coffee was cold and the staff is rude. This place should be shut down. Absolutely the worst McDonalds I've ever been to in my life.",0
Worst experience ever long wait. Then when I got to window waited again. Till I literally had to ask WHY AM I STILL WAITING FOR MY FOOD. as bags were sitting right in front of me.. Total wait time at this McDonald's was like 20 mins. RIDICULOUS..,0
Sitting in line at drive thru for 30 minutes.  Inside closed for whatever reason.  If your drive thru has a 30 min wait then why would walk up be closed? The owner of this place is an idiot.,0
"Drive thru was closed today. 10/9 at 3:45am. Is it still 24 hours if the drive thru is closed and the dining room as well? Park your car and wait, or drive 7 min down the road to the next one....oh the options.",0
They forgot about me in the drive-thru after asking me to pull to the third window. If I could leave 0 stars I would. Finally went into the store to see my bag sitting on the counter for so long it needed to be remade.,0
"In a pinch, it's food. My burger was slipped all over the inside of the wrapper and floating in grease. I just ate the dry parts. My husband's chicken sandwich came without any of the toppings and completely drenched in mystery dressing. Fries were super old and had that old grease fishy taste. Sodas (coke and Dr Pepper) were next to flat.

We were starving after a long hot day so, we just ate it and tried not to think about it.",0
"The Service is bad in special the drivetrue they never give the food correct and management are worse that the bad service that people receive they do not know the meaning of customer service. That McDonald's need to change does managers or give them a good training in customer service, courtesy and Ethical!",0
I waited 10 minutes in 106F to be told I can only place two orders instead 3 in the drive through. It's 2016 and I'm only able to get blue Powerade instea,0
"I used my McDonalds app and got some crazy discounts... but I'm still unsatisfied. The food is sad and old. Mr. Happy at the Expo looked like his life was over and didnt know anything about customer service.  The iced coffee was basically milk and creamer minus the coffee. I know this is fast food but damn, you guys didnt even try today.",0
"Slowest, most under staffed McDonald's I have ever been, everyone honking on the drive trun, people screaming they have been waiting forever, very stressful environment.",0
"Manages to allow something to screw up anything Everytime! I came here for 6 days in total. Normally I do not eat at McDonald's but this place is very close to where I'm staying.

They have new electronic ordering system using touchpad on giant vertical screen. Still gets my order wrong 80 percent of time... What? Asks me what drink I want. Then I just get the cup so why ask me? One day, I leave the locator number on table while I go bathroom. Locator and food is gone. Takes me a while to get it sorted out.forgets my drink {again)

One sauce dispensor just explodes pop knocks the container out of my hand under strong pressure. Gets little sauce on my clothes, not too bad but Jesus Christ... One night, lot of drinks do not work except for coke (yuk)  few other things not worth mentioning. They get swamped a lot nad hardly can keep up.

Otherwise place is relatively new looking as well as private bathroom with your own stall and sink. Clean.",0
Very disappointed that there was no indoor seating. Doors were locked. Drive-thru only. Needed to sit at a table and eat. Decided to eat elsewhere.,0
I ordered off the screen. It said take number and they will bring it to the table. Well the manager got my order together and got it totally wrong and then stood up there call the number and made me come get it. Did not receive any of my drinks. Went back up there a day the manager was not nice at all. Will not visit again.,0
"Jenny or wherever name you have my dear, pls listen to your customer. God bless your heart ",0
"Ordered the new strawberry sundae, too expensive. Tasted like strawberry jelly was used, too sweet and thick. Just order the regular sundae you get the same amount of ice cream. Took way too long to get my sundae.",0
Went here to get food got the completely wrong Order in the bag. And the workers want to make 15$+ an hr. How about do your job correctly first.,0
"So. When me and my family were getting McDonald's. when I ordered a bacon mcdouble with ketchup only, when I opened up my burger, it had pickles and onions on it when I didn't want!!!! I was waiting in the car for 10 minutes for my food. Not coming here again. I'll go to a different McDonald's from now on!!",0
Showed up here order than quarter pound of wwith cheese meal large and a given order to other people and I'm still waiting on it I wouldn't come here,0
"Priscila the 3rd shift supervisor\manager on duty does not care about costumer. I퐉 regular in this McDonalds and usually go on second shift and they are great! But Priscila was not wearing a name tag so I had to ask her for her name, Treat me like nothing. She really needs to work on her costumer service or go to anger ma",0
"Had a crispy chicken sandwich which was ok, small case and fries which resembled a form of spaghetti. I should of gone to Chick-fil-A.",0
36 mins to get food and got told it's because we had a large order.   Service was super slow.  People waiting 30-45 mins for food is ridiculous. Oh and by large order it was 4 Happy meals and a couple 2 for 3.  Ugh very disappointed,0
"Waste of time. Run. Do not go there. You have been warned. They will waste your time, and mess your order up, three times in a row.... Amazing. Zero Stars is my answer but I had to at least click on one to get pass this part.",0
Horrible I ordered two mcDoubles plain pickles only and on attempt #1 I received two with everything on #2 I received a mcDouble pickles only and a single patty hamburger.attempt #3 I took the hamburger back and received a double hamburger.. So I asked for a refund..which I received.. But what really shocked me was the attitude I received for trying to have my order corrected. Bad business,0
They did not put my two big breakfast meals into the bag when I was in the drive through.   I called them many times and not even get a person to pick up the phone.,0
Legit the worst McDonald's ever .have the app can't ever finish my purchase day or night cause guess what they aren't taking app orders .. then Everytime I go it's cash only who the hell carries cash anymore ..this is my Fourth attempt I ma over it the only reason I am even going cause it's open late,0
"I visited this establishment as the kfc over the road was a let down like no other.
Only pro here was that I got what I actually ordered however what a game trying to order it.
The lady was not listening at all and just started adding anything and everything to my order.
She was ruder then my explicit Eminem album and when I finally got to sorting out my order it was awful.. My chicken nuggets tasted like chewing on the chickens feet fresh out of the pen.
My Apple pie was questionable to if it was even a pie or not.
They only gave me bbq sauces, like who doesn't want ketchup ???
The best thing about the meal was driving out of the establishment never to look back again.

2 start because it was better then kfc.",0
The manager Cassandra is very rude to customers and very unprofessional they did not acknowledge people standing at the register and then I asked if they were taking orders they reply with that's why the kiosks are there two customers walked. I work for Uber Eats as a driver picking up food and then I experience very unpleasant,0
Ridicules they still have the dining room closed. Even for take out . Not everyone can go through the drive through due to a truck and trailer .,0
"They forgot to put in the toy, milk and plum sauce in our kids happy meal and forgot the salad dressing for our meal. Never have I seen such a terrible Mc Donalds in my life. I have been in them all over the  world with constant quality till now",0
"Went to eat at 3:40 am.  And the guy tells me that there's only mc chicken sandwiches. And that's all.  And if I wanted breakfast, I'd have to wait till 4 am.  Ridiculous.",0
3 trips here for a collective total of 45 minutes spent... They can't figure out the two lane ordering system... This is not FAST food by any stretch of the imagination... McDonald's are everywhere... Find a different one.,0
I was robbed.  I was charged on my bank card. and i was again charged cash.   I paid twice.  and got no refund.  all I got back. was a threat and an attitude.  no cash back,0
"Employees in the drive thru were rude, they forgot to put napkins and straws in the bag, and when they brought the order to us in the parking spot they thrust it at my husband with a ""here"" and walked off. Very rude.",0
Worst service a cash only McDonald lmao (to be fair it 3am) anyway went through drive thru twice first in both lines and still didn,0
"Yes the area Mc Donalds is known to be busy, but they  had me pull forward and I waited for 2 teas for 20 minutes, after already waiting 10 to get thru the drive thru ,no apologies at all, the first set of ice teas where sour to the taste ugh",0
"Didn't get anything to eat this time,  because they CLOSE THE LOBBY AT 10PM!!! Didn't go through the drive-thru cause I'm on a motorcycle. What kind of dingus closes half their store to customers in Old Town??",0
They were stink add no manners at the counter and took forever would not suggest anyone going Starbucks treat you better and it's down the road much faster,0
Not very helpful staff there machines for  orders doesn't work so good and they don't want to help people order,0
Just avoid this McDonald's at all cost. Staff is rude! Food is cold. Just not worth it. Go to the one in celebration trust me!,0
"We waited 15 minutes for our food, then when we recieved our food, the fries were cold. The fish sandwich tasted like it was microwaved and the new chicken sandwich tasted like rubber",0
Everytime I DoorDash I night they say they,0
"Horrible experience, hungry after a long day at Disney, we stopped in for a late dinner.took forever to take our order and even longer to get our order. definitely felt unwanted",0
"Food cold and forgot items, food was replaced so only 2 star I'm afraid",0
"My son got a vanilla milkshake it looked soupy and he tasted it and he said it had a off taste to it I told him throw it away, in a few minutes he was sick to his tummy . So beware .",0
"DOOR IS LOCKED EVERY SINGLE DAY!
HIGLY RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL!
LETTECE IS SPOILED ALWAYS!
DO NOT RECOMMEND ANY MC DONALD'S IN KISSIMMEE!",0
"SLOWEST McDonald's I have EVER been too... secind time in 3 days coming here, first time was about 25 in druve thru, before ordering.. now been sitting here 15 mins, haven't even ordered yet.. long line but i have been in longer and taken care of...",0
Ridiculous staff was lazy rude and slow bathroom was disgusting I did not eat there and I was hungry so I just left,0
"The trash cans were overflowing, there were multiple spills on the ground that weren't bothered to clean, and every table was dirty. Food took 27 minutes and when it finally came it was cold. Never again",0
Sat in drive thru for 30 minutes. Food was cold. Manager extremely rude. Go elsewhere. This location is horrible.,0
"I ordered a caramel frappe with no whip cream. Upon getting my Carmel frappe there was whip cream. They were upset when I requested they fix my order to meet the way I ordered. When they handed it back to my husband, they had scooped out the whip cream and another quarter of the frappe. Very rude about it as well.",0
EVERY TIME THEY FORGET SOMETHING. And i mean everytime. I have heard conversations about general nonsense take priority over customers while waiting. The employees generally juat dont seem to care with the exception of a few,0
Stopped on my way to work at 6:15 in the morning drive thru full only about 5 people in the inside line . Waited bout 8 minutes no one took my order . Slow service and everyone speaking Spanish.  Walked out no food,0
Employees hardly speak english. I don have 20 minutes to waste because the workers can,0
They need better customer service. The people in the drive thru are so rude that I almost came out my professional skin. Get it together McDonalds. #192 McDonalds close to go cart place,0
They forgot 3sandwiches after they pulled me up n the food was not hot,0
We really can't understand how hard it can be to complete our order. Every single time we go they make multiple mistakes n it's so frustrating.,0
the Worst ?4 hours?McDonald I,0
Dosent stand behind promotion at ordering menu says if they dint mention the 2 for 1$ apple pies at the end of ur order u get one free lies they never mentioned it and i still had to pay for my pies beware!!,0
Horrendous service...was on drive thru for 10 minites...didnt move...went inside...took 15 minutes for 2 shakes and a fry...order was wrong...was ignored when i told them order was wrong..pretty hard to offend this new york guy...worst McDonald's i have ever been in!!,0
Disappointed - claimed Egg Mc muffin deal was over and charged outlandish price! Service not great - wrong coffee received after ordering DECAF and NO cream given...,0
"It was terrible, took forever. Only giving 2 stars because the McMuffin was good.",0
I've never been to such a horrible restaurant like this. It took over 1 hour to get fries and a McFlurry. Stay as far away as you can from this McDonald's. Nasty dirty facility too.,0
I didn't get much sugar for my coffee all milk and day getting served my Burger not my Burger my sausage mcmuffin didn't give it to me in the morning They got me for some money not a pleasant place to go when you hungry you want your food,0
Horrifically slow even when nobody is in line. The worst Mcdonalds I've been to speed wise. We gave it three tries and it was slow each time.,0
Never once have I gotten my coffee done right. Cream in sugar out. I got 35 cream in my bag. It was 8 cream in. I got no sugar. Crazy,0
Took 10 minutes to take my cash for order.then another 20 minutes to get my food.which was missing the drink for the happy meal. Not good,0
"Terrible service, I think hands down worst mcdonalds I have ever been too. Manager wouldn't even come over to help. Absolute joke of a mcdonalds. Go 1 mile down either way and you will be much happier.",0
"Not to thrilled with this one anymore,  used to love it when it was the world biggest McDonalds. Now it's like the others except for a few items on the menu.  Plus they got rid of the life size Ronald McDonald.",0
Because we had a big order they kept giving our food to other people who had smaller orders. People who ordered after us had already eaten and left by the time we got our food.,0
"I waited in the drive thru line for half an hour, ordered my food, and not until I got to the window did they tell me they were taking cash only, at 11pm on a saturday? And when I asked to talk to the manager on duty they were no where to be found, mever returning to this location and would urge anyone thinking of it to stear clear from this horrible McDonalds",0
Burger was greasy and the fries tasted like the oil needed changed,0
Super slow...we waited an extremely long time in the drive through.  People behind us were beeping and honking because no one was taking orders in one drive thru lane.,0
This place sucks beyond belief. Staying in a hotel next door have a semi for my wheels. Knocked on the door ask the manager if I could order a shake and get it at the door. I'm sure you can guess the answer,0
The worst place do even be doing uber the manager makes uber drivers wait and dont even put order thru tell u get there please speed up for me to keep doing uber here and i hope the gm sees this maybe she will make u speed up judith,0
"Super long drive thru lines , I suggest u go in the lobby n place order electronically for faster service ",0
Waited in drive thru for 20 minutes had to go in to get our order.manager was great but they had everyones order messed up.,0
"Food it's okay, however the customer service is terrible. The few times I visited here the staff was rude, and unprofessional.",0
Worst prices hair in food stay away no self serve drink station,0
"By far the worst McDonald's that I have ever been to. The entire experience was bad, time consuming, and they didn't even get my food right.",0
If I could give a zero star I would. This place took 5 minutes to even greet me at the window. I ended up driving away with no food. Don't waste your time here.,0
"The wait is 30 minutes, my nuggets where white in the center because they didn't separated them before putting in the fryer, all McDonalds that I visited near my hotel on kisseme took 30 minutes.",0
"Good food but ,staff so bad, every one  even the manager",0
One of the worst McDonald's in the nation. The food is usually stale or cold and is always made sloppily. When you complain they act like you are at fault for the bad sandwich.,0
No free refills. What a drag.,0
Too long waiting lines to get a very bad customer service. Food is ok.,0
"Having kiosks, instead of human cashier, really a bad idea not fan of it. Taking my business to a different place were greetings,  and thank you is the most important thing!!",0
Like all the other McDonald's they're expensive underpaid understaffed and they close too early but that's because they're understaffed,0
Very rude customer service. Go somewhere else,0
"HORRIBLE I WENT HERE FOR AN UBER PICK UP AND IF YOU DROVE UBER BEFORE YOU CAN PICKUP THRU THE DRIVE THRU AND WHEN I TOLD THEM THAT SHE SAID ""WE ARE REALLY BUSY RIGHT NOW SO YOU HAVE TO COME IN OR ITS UP TO YOU"" WHEN I WENT IN I WAS EXPECTING A LING LINE. BUT INSTEAD THERE WAS ONLY 1 PERSON INFRONT OF ME. NOT BUSY AT ALL. THIS WAS HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. MCDONALD'S NEVER LETS ME DOWN SMH.",0
Over 1 hour to go through the drive thru.  Only 20 cars.  Absolutely a mess.,0
They had someone who dont know how to take order and and everything was dry nasty and the coffee plus the manager was there smh,0
Waited almost 20 minutes for an order. There were only 5 cars in drive thru and about 7 people inside.  Finally I canceled and went to a sit down restaurant where I got served within 10 minutes.,0
False advertising. Drive through is open 24 hours. Diner closes at 10!,0
"It's a messy please, the costumer service is very nasty they don't even pay attention to the time that people are waiting in line. I'm not going to gave them any Stars.",0
Food was very good but quite a lot was missing from the order when we got home.,0
"Incredible slow, lines are out of control, understaffed.",0
Total order mess up and the person taking my order hated his job. The only reason I know is because he told me.,0
Let's put it this way.....you better check your bag of food before leave. They can barely understand English let alone get your order right. ,0
Food is always wrong,0
The service was terrible. They got my order wrong twice and they didn't have me my fries with my food. And the first time they miss something in my order....,0
Worse McDonald's I've ever been to. Twice I've been there and both times I had to sit there and wait almost 15 mins to get my food. The second time the staff was there in the kitchen taking pictures while my food was getting cold. Never again,0
WORST McDonald EVER!!!  Awful em,0
We waited in the drive thru for 30 minutes. It was late after visiting the parks all day and they were close to our hotel. I would stay clear of this disaster of a restaurant.,0
Slowest McDonald's I've ever visited.  Checked in on a pickup order for Uber.  Waited 15 minutes and they were so backed up that they hadn't even started on the order yet.  Will not be returning to this location.,0
the service was horrible I was very very disappointed they don't give you the right food that don't take that order correctly then-manager I don't know why they do on their time because you ask for manager and takes forever to come and assist you I will never go there again,0
Building is completely locked so can't use bathroom even after waiting for curbside.,0
Cash only drive through after waiting 30 minutes,0
"They can not get any order right. My order took 3 remakes and finally I had to go in to the restaurant, after placing my original order in the drive thru!",0
A drive through line around the building and into the shopping center parking lot that barely moved for 20 minutes made me drive off without ordering.,0
I dont understand because mc Donald is a fast food place and I go thru the drive thru and  the tell me that I have to wait in one of the parking spots in stead of grab and like any normal fast food.,0
The buttermilk crispy tenders are not crispy nor tender the meat is horrible the worst I've ever had why would I eat here when I can get some decent fries chicken and burgers at Culver's or some f the best fast food chicken from chik full ,0
Hands down the slowest service I have EVER seen at ANY fast food restaurant.,0
Drive threw took forever we waited 40 minutes to find out there ice cream machine was down drive threw cashier was very rude and uncaring,0
Slow service got orders wrong but still kept people waiting while rest of their food went cold worst mc donalds I've been to for service,0
"If you need food late at night after work (2-3 am), don't count on this place because they take at MINIMUM 20-30 mins to send you through the drive thru.",0
If the app says you can dine in there than you should be able to dine inside,0
"Usally the location I visit is on the money both with over allservice and cleanses, how ever this particular day the place was a total mess and service was horrible when it should not have been because it wasn't busy.",0
"Worse c/s ever! Unreal, people just DON'T want to work. This team bust gave up!",0
Ordered 2 double fish fillet sandwiches and got 1 double and 1 single. Order must be checked and double checked for Togo. I'm not coming back to change the order after few miles.,0
"Service sucks, how are you 24/7 and randomly close 2-6?? Waste of time",0
They messed up the order after explaining a few times of what we wanted and had hair in both of my egg McMuffins,0
"Horrible bad service waited too long at the  drive through, missing everything in my order",0
"The good thing is that is open 24. They do not have enough personnel. Food was just okay, help us survive till the next morning.",0
Standard food. Fast service. Cash only at night. More expensive than other McDs.,0
Manager doesn't know how to put his name tag on right side up. How can he run a restaurant?,0
"Tried 3 of the kiosk to order my food. Never completed an order on a kiosk, something different wasn't available on each one. Busy as hell, took a long time to get my food. Never again",0
Increible how the drivethru work here waiting the outside line more than 5 mins and see how the inside lo e pass 7 cars already... unacceptable,0
My son got a vanilla shake there it didn't look right it was soupy he tasted it and his stomach was upset all that day,0
Bad experience taking too long with the orders.,0
Took 29 minutes in the drive thru for 2 McDoubles and a happy meal. At 7pm.,0
"It was a crappy McDonald's. They lie about their hours I went around 9:30 for food and they were ""closed""! When they clearly say that they are 24hours. Don't waste your time with this place! Worst McDonald's ever",0
Tortillas stale and why ask if I want sauce if you aren't going to give any? Lol,0
Gave order in the drive thru lady wasn't paying attention on what I wanted mind you I only ordered 3 things had to repeat myself 3 more times at the window then they still get my order wrong never again,0
If I could give it zero stars I would we went here 3 times recently and they mess up every time and they are just rude people I would recommend staying away from this location there's a checkers across the street I would recommend over them,0
Terrible service. Left the drive thru after barely moving for 10 minutes. Not prepared for late night customers.,0
Slow service. And we were the only ones in there  Found hair in my food. If I could give no stars I would never comming back,0
Terrible..An Employee name Andrea has the worse Customer service ever. My order was wrong and they still was giving me a hard time to fix it..BAD SERVICE,0
"Me and my family were there at 10:15 pm on a Sunday and they would not let us in.we were not happy at all,wat to soon to be locking doors.",0
The only thing worse than the service was the food. My wife's Big Mac tasted like it had been dropped in an ashtray.,0
"Very dirty.  Cold food.  Somebody peed in the play area.  Management was informed, but nobody cleaned it up.",0
This is my third time visiting this store horrible place to eat all the 3 person at the service desk did not even eye contact with me and after food ready they just damp my order on the desk and I had to asked one gentleman if that was my order then he said  yes horrible place will not recommend it,0
"Ordered a regular big mac with large fries. They gave me the Bigmac Bacon, it was cold. Fries were cold.",0
"Curbside is a joke
Waited for 15 mins, should just go through the drive thru.",0
Always a long wait today it took 35 min in drive through most times around 15 min but like their ice tea so but up with it,0
Slow as molasses and still couldnt get it right. Dont go here after 12am. Had to go inside and get my $1 soda they forgot to give me.,0
"Waited more than 20 mins, trying to make order but they just keep saying"" be right with you"" to finally tell me they dont have what i wanted.",0
Watched a Manager Jennifer push and put her hands on an employee while she was handing my food out the window. Don't know why because the Order was 100% right. This is the way employees at McDonald's are treated?,0
Only gave me part of the food that I ordered them the manager gave me attitude they weren't remorseful for messing up my order at all,0
FOOD  WAS MEDIOCRE! The service slow and unfriendly.,0
The Drive Thru Was way too long there were 100 cars we we waiting 20 minutes to order. It's shorter ordering inside,0
Management just stands there while employees run around working,0
"Extremely slow service, one cashier with multiple people working slowly in the back, a line up to and out the door, and the drive through wrapped around the building. Avoid late at night.",0
The diner was dirty and so was all the tables and I dont want to mention the restrooms were smelly and dirty there was two teenagers on their cell phones wasting valuable Time,0
The lady at the drive-thru was extremely rood and they messed up my big Mac I was missing two cheeseburgers and my 10-piece nugget only had seven nuggets,0
"Dirty, unkind, too long waiting time, too high work load with minimum of employees",0
We퐎e always missing stuff from our order. About to start going to th,0
"Neg stars.

After waiting 30 minutes in drive threw, my hashbrown was literitly cold. And my bagel was soggy... worst breakfast ever ",0
Don't get the breakfast burritos they advertise a nice beautiful looking burrito on their menu and then when you get it it's a quarter of the size of which they advertise the price has gone up on these and the quality has gone way down they have false advertising on their menu,0
Worst McDonalds  I've ever been to. Waited over twenty minutes.  Burgers were almost  raw. Plus no toys in happy meals.,0
This is my second visit and it's even slower and longer than my first. Unbelievably long wait times in the drive through.,0
Long wait and 3manger on duty and one person line. Then to fine out no fish at certain time bk at all times,0
Waited on line for 45 mins just to place the order.,0
it prompted me to legitimately kill myself. so ridiculous. never have had towards long in my 35 years of life,0
The people working here are not friendly.  Went through the drive through and the only only thing said to me was my total.,0
Somehow they forgot to give us our order...no big deal I needed the exercise and they did apologize,0
"Food was cold.
Service could of been better",0
Waited 30 minutes in drive thru line be told they are out of fish and chicken,0
"I was there to separate times one time I paid over $2 more than the second
time and got the exact same thing",0
Messed up our order something terrible and then asked us to pay extra for the mess they made took forever in line slow slow people,0
McDonald's is the worst the foods always cold and they recook old food when you ask for it hot but the frappes are the bomb that's why they got a star.,0
Slow and the people behind me got their food first. Common problem here. I just order a drink and burger.,0
"Waited 60 minutes in a drive thru, the line wasnt even that big. The lines at the theme parks are better",0
"1 star because I had cheese on my burger last night. And I didn't ask for it. Also the service was slow. The worker's was playing , goofing off ,and not working when suppose to.",0
Rude managers profiled me. Had my life threaten by Corp. Worst fast food ever,0
Poor costumer service.  Slow and cold food.  The manager didn't care about my order had me waiting for over 30 minutes,0
Well let's see it took me 27 minutes to go through their bullship drive-through for 2 mcdoubles holy shedding this a joke,0
Slow service,0
Ice cream machine never works after waiting 20 minutes in drive thru line for nothing,0
"Drive thru takes forever and orders are never right, the inside with the new send order plus counter orders it's mobbed and confusing",0
Horrible customer service. Avoid this restaurant if at all possible.,0
This mcdonalds serves lettuce that had already gone bad and turned brown. Absolutely disgusting.,0
"This place is Nasty as heck ! The Garbage was over flowing, there was bugs on the floor, and all the bathroom stalls was locked even though there was no one in them",0
"Super slow service,  sloppy wrapped cheese burgers, not so friendly staff, some of them not all staff. what more can i say.",0
"No customer service skills, not even the managers always getting orders  wrong and give u attitude bc u said something",0
"Might be I expect more from it. But, in comparison to the EU McDonald's the food is poor. Drive through is a nightmare.",0
Can't ever get order right. Had to walk into the back to find someone to wait on me.,0
They didn't have apple slices and toy for the Happy meal.,0
"Might be the worst McDonald's I've seen can't even make a coffee no napkins, ketchup or even a fork with my big breakfast meal worst idea to stop there",0
"Slow!!!!  Haven't tried the food yet, since I am min minute 32 of waiting for my FAST food",0
"Place is dirty I don't recommend no one to stop at this place the drinking fountain is dirty, workers have a attitude drive thru takes least 25 min to a car to move!",0
"Sooo slow, and got my order completely wrong. Didn't seem to care.",0
The people at the window were rude and they were out of everything! And waited in line for 30 min and then was told that they were cash only!!!!,0
The food was hot I'm just not a fan of McDonald's but two children enjoyed it,0
Closed early and drive thru takes forever,0
Need to update breakfast app menu and add back the souther style chicken biscuit,0
Terrible I ordered my food at 8:40 AM it is currently 9:01 and my food is still not here,0
"took 30 minutes for our food to come out, walked past us once, forgot the sauces and forgot the drinks along with a very negative attitude",0
It smell and it was dirty. The worker were very pleasant,0
Food is nasty and wait at night is unheard of. Horrible staff,0
They forgot the top bun on one sandwich. Everything else wasn't much better. Thrown together and awful.,0
Female Mnager day shift wi,0
"Took too long to complete order, dirty floor, overall impression of a badly run McDonalds - a rarity.",0
Worst McDonald's I've been to,0
"Service slow, food cold and dry. Had to queue back up to get a cup.",0
I tried to buy a burger for a homeless lady and the manager told me no! She then approached the homeless lady and told her to leave.,0
Why 14 minutes for 2 Apple pies? Order wss placed 2-3 minutes before that.,0
"Forgets food often, longer wait time than some coasters in town. Ran out of diet coke.",0
Food was the same but this was a half hour wait for food. Clearly this franchise was not up for a noon rush hour.,0
Everything is trash at the McDonald there ,0
It,0
The food tastes like microwaved meat with barley any flavor,0
Wait for almost an hour for the order. The delivery lady missed our table and send our food to another table. Worst M store ever,0
They were extremely slow.,0
Forgot our food twice. Went back and they act like we were lying about it,0
Service very slow on all 3 visits and they get the order wrong.  Very very poor.,0
"Terrible restaurant, very dirty, I do not understand how Mac DOnal let have this disgusting restaurant",0
The service in every Mcdonalds is doing worst with the time.,0
always making mistakes and errors with orders or don't have the employees to service customers,0
Dirty place very unclean and big wait for cold food!,0
Fries were cold and they did not like the fact I asked for fresh ones.,0
"The manager was really mean with the employee...if them have a problem with the employee ,they must take them to the back",0
Worst place ever very bad customer service...if i could put - stars i would.,0
Order food here and wait 30 mins for your order.... no fast food here,0
"Bad service ... I'm very disappointed, this place has awful customer service .",0
3 times asked for sauce for nuggets got home no sauce,0
When you are starving and nothing else in sight for the pocket change you have..... well that's why i go to McDonalds.,0
Not only was the speed of service poor I waited in line for just under 20 mins to receive my food thrown inside of a bag. I did not eat either the 1/4 pounder or the nuggets. They really need to shut this restaurant down because for the love of god they don't hire decent staff this has been going on for years I'm not eating food with strands of hair or food that's hanging out of a bag such ill preparation,0
"Had a weird, terrible, unusual experience ,Went tonight, about 8:20pm. Only 2 cars in front of me. Ordered using my mobile app (which I love it!) Ordered a mc chicken, and guess what?!! It came with NO CHICkEN!! And enough mayo to make two more. Enjoy the picture!!",0
Attention owner: do you even care??? Worst drive-through in all of Florida. S L O W!! Fire everyone including your manager you got the 3 stooges working in there! It is NEVER okay to sit in a drive thru for 20 minutes. Get it together or close your doors!,0
"Can't change mobile order once placed. I wanted light chocolate in my coffee instead of 6 obese size pumps that drowns the actual taste of coffee and makes it taste extremely sweet. Asked at speaker, window 1, window 2 and the person that made it. Can't do it. And they forgot the hot sauce to my burrito. But this is McDonald's standard.",0
"constantly miss items. it baffles me. I work fast food. items pop up on a screen, you put them in the bag. its very simple. half the time they put ice in the drink when I ask for no ice, which again, a drink pops up on a screen, and underneath it will say ""no ice"". I'm not really sure if yall just don't care or if this is really that hard.",0
"This is the second time I've came to this McDonald's and they are closed. How you 24 hours but closed. They very rude. Last time they told me they open at 7am in the drive thru, then this morning I was told 6:30am. I come to this one because it's so close to my house. But it seems I'm going have to find another one. This McDonald's need a manager and someone who can be in charge and know how to handle a restaurant. When I come to this McDonald's I always spend $40 or better. Get y'all stuff together",0
"Says 24/7. Mobile app allows for drive through order. Lights are all on and drive through speaker is active. But nobody is working. Location is closed, no sign, no disabling online orders, nothing.",0
"Repeatedly missing items. Repeatedly ignoring allergy restrictions such as simple specifics on orders like no onion, no cheese, etc. overnight is horrible. Overnight Manager identified herself as  crystal on 3/5/23 was not helpful and in better terms, an incompetent woman.",0
I was light headed. I figured let me stop at this McDonald's seeing that its on my way home and close by. I was surprised the shake machine was up and running. I ordered large fries and a Strawberry milkshake. I paid to much money for a little nit of food. My fries had way too much salt on them. Because they mixed fresh fries with fries that wrre sitting out basically old kinda stale. The milkshake had vanilla at the bottom with Strawberry on top. But that nits what kinda upset me it was the size of the shake. I was asked what size I wanted. Of course I was confused. I guess all McDonald's are not the same. I said small. But the cup I received was a cup size you order off the dollar menu. And I was charged like 5 bucks for it. Smh. Never again. I thought shake size was only small or large.  Not a baby cup size.,0
"The amount of times I come to this location, and the ystem is down?is embarrassing.  I work in food, I know when people don",0
"They need more happy people in there and people to actually Acknowledge there guest and smile.  It's horrible to feel like your a bother as a customer when your spending your hard earned working money at your restaurant.  NOT GOOD for the business at all, especially when your a regular.  This needs attention Immediately to earn the people's business.",0
"I hate this McDonald's in the morning. The drive through workers are undertrained and snappy ( there is a difference between a sausage egg mcmuffin and a sausage mcmuffin) I was overcharged the manager (Tim) had me pull up for whatever reason ( I assumed for my overcharge) and never came out the door, I go in after 15 minutes and he acts unresponsive to the guy calling his name( that's how I know what it is) very unprofessional and I will be reaching out to their corporate headquarters about this matter",0
This isn the first time it happens but it definitely the one that bothered me the most. Went for lunch did a mobile order to make  it quick and spent 20 minutes of my 30 minute lunch waiting for my food. Had to walk in and ask for it. No napkins or st,0
Couldn even order line at drive thru and only one lane open. So I prefer to go in because I퐉 not wasting gas for t,0
"Always takes longer than any other drive-thru. Advertises that the drive-thru is open 24 hours (both online and with signage at the store), but it isn't.",0
"Went is using a mobile code and the lady at the register had not clue what she was doing , so I asked for a manager and she told me she was the manager . So I tryed to help her out telling her my code was for a 5$ meal and I would like to add a 4 piece nuggets to that ! She told me the total was 12$ so in my head I퐉 like no way a 4 piece is 6 $ so I told her that was incorrect and she instead it wasn , so she does Somthing on the computer I pay and still missing my extra nuggets after I told her 4 times I would like a extra",0
Horribly slow each of the last 2 times I've gone here.  Attempting to grab something quick for my kids or wife and just no such thing as fast food any longer.,0
Showed up at 440am they said we are closed till 5am. Waited till 5am and then they said 530am??? What is going on with the world. This is after coming from trying to order at the other McDonald,0
The employees in that place is soo terrible their very rude the lady told me to hold on I,0
Slowest drive thru ever. Takes over 30 minutes for anything!,0
"Not only does this location take forever to give you the wrong food, they also give you undercooked food. We had to wait over 10 minutes for our order and this chicken sandwich was still pink.",0
12.17 Late Saturday and No one is working at this McDonald's.  It's supposed to be 24 hours.  Poorly managed like most McDonald's.  GM should be canned.,0
I have never seen such a slow mc donasl in my life.,0
"Very slow customer service, 2nd day in a row that they are out of orange juice. Not up to standards",0
"Seriously this place is gone to the dogs. Imagine sitting in line at a fast food restaurant for over 25 minutes to get a burger and fries. Only to receive said Burger and half of the large fry you ordered. Cold limp fries inside of a large container which could have easily fit in a medium container. I'm so sick of these restaurants. Fast food is no longer fast food, the service is subpar, and the food is not even as advertised. I'm literally getting jipped on my food while also waiting for almost 30 minutes to get it.",0
When I called and asked for a whopper they just hung up on me. I WANT MY WHOPPER!!!!,0
"I'm not one to just say only something negative but for the life of me I can't find anything positive. This branch is the slowest I have ever been to . It never gets my order right , no matter how simple I made it. The burger's condiments were all wrong . The fry's were old as hell and the unsweet tea tasted old and sour.  Definitely no going there again no matter how desperate.",0
"I never ever go here because it's the most incompetent McDonald's I've ever seen operate. I ran the drive thru in NYC when I was 17 so I know a thing or two about the process and how it's really not rocket science but somehow they can't ever get it right. Unfortunately for me my husband picked up dinner for me from there and I very Unfortunately didn't specify which one to go to... although this one is closest to home I will drive all the way to Altamonte to avoid it, and the way gas prices are that should tell you all you all need to know. Tonight it was missing fries (we ordered a total of 6 whole items so I can see how that was overwhelming to this bunch) and freezing cold fries which I have no idea how you can even do since even if it been under the warmer for a while... stone cold fries? I wouldn't put it past them they kept them on a counter somewhere instead though. And on top of that I made the mistake of asking for extra pickles on my big mac which I'm sure put this kitchen in a frenzy so they just threw all the ingredients in the box so I can do my own assembling of it... which was probably for the best because who knows what chaos it would cause for them to assemble it. I would be embarrassed to own this place. Don't go here... I know it's fast food and we shouldn't expect much but Altamonte Mcds never dissapoints. Trust me it's worth the drive.",0
Cold fries. Double cheeseburgers were not hot and the cheese wasn't melted.  The m&ms were dumped on the top of the mcflurry and some spilt out.  $18 is expensive for my meal and a happy meal for my daughter. Then subpar at best.,0
Bad service that don't give me what you order,0
"Very unsatisfied, order was wrong. Management correct my order. Just gave me an extra fry and dismissed me. Will not be returning. My money is just as good at burger King. I understand that you are short-handed, but that should never compromise customer service.",0
yall need to step it work I know its stressful but ppl at the window need to look in the bag know its the right thing and repeat it back . I'm happy I don't work there nor do I ever want to if I had to but everytime our order is wrong . and you pay for not what you get its sad we can't afford to pay for sonthing we want. and get ripped off. let's do better guys. if you don't like ur job or have an additide towards ppl just leave it at home or find another job .,0
"Today visit was the worse . Other stops they forgot things or wrong in my orders, forgetting hashbrowns , wrong  items drinks made wrong. But today it took the cake, The work took a couple of minutes to take are order . Then when we got are order my wife check it, all the items where there . But only 2 ideam that where right was the hash browns and a sweet tea . Order a #3  Bacon egg and cheese biscuit or hash Browns and sweet tea 2nd order was a sausage egg mcmuffin with a hot chocolate. We got a sausage muffin with cheese and a sausage muffin with a hot chocolate that my wife said it was not drinkable . If you ask why didnt we take it back . We dont have time drop the wife off at work then i get on the road to go to work . Dont think we be going back to this McDonald's its becoming more of a disappointment then a enjoyment.",0
I felt really sick after eating the fish fillet sandwich. They made me wait a long time at curbside for my sandwich and fries. I assumed it will all be fresh. How wrong was I. Disgusting sandwich and stale fries. Never returning to this location again.,0
"I ordered a kid's meal that took 14 minutes to receive,  they claim hash browns are not a lunch time item even though it's on the all day breakfast menu claiming it took 12 minutes to cook a hash brown worst location ever",0
"I came here at around 11pm last night, I ordered a spicy mcchicken medium meal, 2 cheeseburgers, and I asked for the fries fresh. I usually never have an issue when I go to other McDonald's. I order the same thing. Well its not fresh, its called ""to order"". I had to wait , no issues with that, if you want fresh food you typically have to wait for it to be made.  I got my food 8 minutes later and drove off so I could get the food to the house. Almost home, I look in the bag and grab a fry, because mcdonalds fries fresh are freaking delicious. Yeah no, I bit 5 fries all at once and they were soggy and unsalted. Highly disappointed. I tried to call and the phone just rang. I was no longer close to the mcdonalds so I just ordered the same thing at another mcdonalds closer to my destination in winter park. They actually gave me a discount and apologized for my troubles at this mcdonalds. They said they ""understood"". I wont be coming back to this mcdonalds.",0
The worst place to eat. Go there only if you have 3 hours of leisure time & you dont mind waiting 45 minutes to an hr to be taken care of. Only one manager & too many rookies are uncapable too supply the high demand.,0
Terrible service. Charged me $7.98 for 2 snack size McFlurries when that is the price for 2 regular size. Asked for a meal and only gave me the burger. Full of dumb people that can,0
"Worst McDonald's in the area. After waiting in line over 20 minutes I finally get to the window, for them to inform me that they were closed. Mind you this was at 1:12 am Saturday morning. The store hours for this location reads closes at 3 a.m not 1:12 a.m!! Clearly management didn't want to serve any more customers due to high volume not because they were closed or closing. Will never go back to this location.",0
"I live close so I frequent this location. They almost always get my very simple order wrong and they can't even use the most basic forms of respect such as speaking to a customer. They just take the card, hand it back(most of the times without the receipt) and at the next window hand you your incorrect order without so much as a word. Head a few miles down A1A and get much better service with a friendlier staff.",0
"The last in a string of bad experiences, I only received half my order and it was still wrong. Genuinely impressive how almost every experience at this location is terrible. Won't be returning",0
"This has been one of the worst McDonald's I have been too. Not only where the to drive through lines extremely long, but then when we get to the window the person was confused with our order. We drive up to get our food and the person was pleasant enough. The food now left a lot to be desired. French fries were not fresh. They had zero salt. We ordered a 10 piece of chicken nuggets and got eight pieces. Then on top of that they're old and stale and cold. Needless to say we will never be going there again.",0
Miyra is extremely rude and slow. Acts like she hates her job. Took 30 minutes to get an egg McMuffin and hash brown,0
Horrible McDonald's I had visited this McDonald's in the late evening and I was getting cussed out by a employee mopping the floor. How would I supposed to know what area are you mopping without a sign? or just tell me politely to watch my step. I would've kept coming to this McDonald's but if someone is mopping the floor and cussing customers out for walking on the wet floor needs to be fired.,0
Strangely I almost always get skipped in line at this McD. I will pull up as the lone vehicle and another pulls up a minute later in the lane beside me and get immediate service. I am not sure if it's because my car is quiet or what but its mildly annoying. Never has my sauce order been correct. Never. Even when I pay for it. Even when I ask and confirm at the window. It's awkward confirming sauce and then having to ask for the exact sauce you were just promised was in the bag.,0
"Today at approximately 2:20 I asked for a happy meal and asked for the extra french fries in the order and the lady of the dri thru told me give it to me - give it to me now, in a high tone of voice give me the bag and I pack very reluctantly, she was really rude at the time of serving me simply for asking for some fries, now if you could give me a feedback, because it really is not the way to serve the customer",0
"Ok, so I went and tried the new Spicy chicken nuggets, I personally prefer the Wendy's spicy nuggets they are much more tender and fresh tasting. The McDonald's Spicy Nuggets were Spicy alone, add on the Spicy sauce and they will make you sweat!!! But mine were extremely dry and hard, one had a weird rubber chewy piece so that was interesting, I can say I tried them but I was not impressed.",0
"food is typically put together well, however curbside is a minimum of 20 minutes once you pull up. Then hopefully you can get a curbside spot because the spots are usually full of customers theyve had pull forward and park to wait for their food. might as well go through the drive thru",0
"i퐉 honestly only leaving one star because i have to. staff was rude as can be. i went through the drive thru and ordered a #9 the 2 cheeseburger meal and an extra cheeseburger with a small fry and at the window checked the food and the employee was rude asked if we got a problem and rolled her eyes. well the order was wrong so good thing i checked. went inside the store and finally got my cheeseburgers after standing there for 15 minutes and complained to the manager and she walked away with no response. Finally got my food and opened it up and there was A HAIR IN MY FOOD. the entire order was wrong the first time around. Never will i ever go back to this restaurant again.  terrible service, i just ended up going bac",0
They mess with your food here!!!,0
"I left in fear. I was treated so rude. Sat at drive through for 20 minutes.. Was yelled at walking up to window to ask why they are not taking my order. Did nothing wrong but was treated like a criminal. And then the comment. "" Don't worry, we will take special care of your order"" in that tone.  I WILL NEVER FEEL SAFE EATING AT MY MCDONALD'S AGAIN",0
"I am done with this Mcdonald's ! I have been going there almost every morning and get a double biscuit and gravy. How hard is it to get a order correct.They charge me for it but I don't get it. It seems when a certain crew is working i get the worst service or no service. I have been told they have no gravy, no biscuits best one of all at 4 am they do not service breakfast due to corona. But waffle house does..",0
"Unfortunately today while waiting in line (pulled to the side not in the drive through lane) my frappe was given to the person behind me. She graciously didn't take it and instead got off her car and walked back inside with it. I waited 10 mins and when nothing happened I went through the drivethrough line again and the girl at the window told me she was gonna give me that same drink back. I was very confused by this, especially in Covid times. I requested a different drink, no offense to the nice lady that brought it back but just to be safe. The worker said to me that the lady only touched the lid while carrying it so then I asked to change the lid to which they told me I had to pull forward and wait again. Needless to say it was not worth being late to work for this 占쏙",0
"If I could give it zero stars I would. Your MANAGER is RUDE. Someone ordered breakfast at 1050am, she said no more breakfast. I said ""there is no more breakfast?"" She said out loud, in front of customers ""ends at 1030, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT"" No everyone DOESNT know that, some serve it 24/7. She continued to berate me.",0
"The employees are great but the store manager is just a nightmare. We have coupons with the McDonald's app. The store manager stated that she really hoped that they would stop honoring them, because she was tired of having to ring then up. My wife and I went to the restaurant today and, she said the system was down and she would not accept them at all. I'm going to try and avoid this McDonald's in the near future.",0
"Super rude. Suppose to be 24 hrs and they acted like ""how dare i eat here"" at like 2am. The worker never even spoke to me just took my card and shut the door on me didn't even get a chance to ask for ketchup.",0
"They never ever give me the amount of cream and sugar I ask for in my coffee. The super lazy ones tell me their cream and sugar dispensers are broken at least one to two times a week :/ been visiting the one and extra mile away in Casselberry, just bc they make my coffee how I want. This location used to get a LOT of my hard earned dollars but as of late I been choosing other location.",0
"My order # was 1471. Simple order. Big breakfast with extra sausage
No utensils, no syrup, no extra sausage.
So I call. Nina said she was the manager. But transferred me to Bri. Told Bri what happened and she said she would talk to the crew. So I explained that does not help me. I still don have what I paid for. She asked how she could help. I asked her to hang on while I answered another phone. Instead she hung up. Few minutes later I called back. Now no one will answ",0
"Has to be THE most depressing McDonalds in the area. Ran by a bunch of immature, rude, and miserable workers. I go there because its the closest to me, but won't be going back.",0
"I bought some sundaes and I requested some napkins, but they refused to provide them to me. Too miserable for a multinational company. If they don't provide napkins, what can we expect for the food?",0
DO NOT EAT HERE. Me and 2 friends work right near this McDonald's. We all have each gotten sick twice on completely different occasions each time we eat here. I'm pretty sure they cook these burgers on the floor.. Don't go here unless you like upset stomachs or puking.,0
Serivce was horrible i walked in there asked for my drinks serveral times and the workers when lost and confused so i walked in a made my own ice tea then i appertantly caused a distrubance by doing that never going back here.,0
"1st time I came, they said they were closed. It's a 24 hr McDonald's. Second time I came, at 4:30 am, still had to wait more than 15 min in Drive thru for order. Only 3 cars ahead of me. Ridiculous.",0
Just wondering why if the hours on the door say they퐎e open for Dine-in unti,0
Ordered nuggets and 3 drinks. Was asked to move and wait in a spot.  Staff did not even listen to order.,0
Slow af I don,0
Worst place ever took 16 minutes in the drive thru to get my order it should take no more than 4 min or less to get food out,0
"3rd visit in 3 weeks to the one  simeron in Apopka near hunt club , first time was slow service the second visit I was told at the drive thru they couldn't take anymore orders because the staff didn't show up but yet took orders in the other lane, and today's visit again super slow and after we left the drive thru realized the sweet tea was not sweet. I'm so done with this location!",0
Good morning good morning the coffee was old the place is dirty I will not come back here again the people are nice but the place is dirty very dirty please clean up paint please cleanest McDonald though the bathroom was dirty the tables were dirty the outside was dirty have a great day,0
"Worst McDonalds you can possibly find in Florida. If I could give 0 stars that would be more suitable.  They mess up orders they're the only McDonalds in 10 miles that charges extra after 2 pumps of sugar. They dont understand what ""light ice"" means and you're going to have problems if you are trying to use their app for coupons. Please do not allow this McDonalds to ruin your experience and take your money, any McDonalds within 5 miles of this location will provide you the proper service McDonalds is iconic for. Take it from a local, stay far away from this location unless you like waiting ridiculous wait times and feeling cheated out of your money. I have visited this location enough times to understand they are literally the worst location I have been to. This is coming from someone who has been all around central Florida. Please do yourself a favor and go to any other McDonalds to get the experience you deserve.",0
Cashier Jamesha mocking customers laughing in their face. Moving very slow. At her own beat. Very rude. If I were apart of the Wright family she would definitely not be apart of my family business. I was in drive thru for 25 minutes before parking and coming inside all to witness the foolery which has the line backed up in the first place. However Jamesha is the only one who had a name tag on. Everyone looked over worked and under paid. Very slow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also as I'm writing this review waiting my order it's been 35 minutes here total. The manager sets the tone and she is even slower. Her walk expresses she's lazy,0
"I've been going to this location most of my life since it's not far from my home. So I've seen this McDonald's go through a lot of changes. The employees here generally have decent attitudes, there are a few that tend to be rude. The store is also dirty a lot of the time. It's a very busy location, and maybe it's from having a lot of foot traffic, but the floor is usually dirty, the drink station will be filthy and wet and sticky, the ketchup area will be out of ketchup, and/or there will be ketchup all over the place, too. The tables tend to be dirty, too, you usually have to clean off your own table. Also they have those light up tables that kids like, and when I go in there with my kid there will be homeless people sitting there, and they won't be eating, and they'll have their stuff all over the place and sit there for hours. And mind you, these tables seat about 8 and there will be one homeless person sitting there. My kid will want to sit there so he can play with the lights, and I'll have to tell him he can't because this one homeless person sitting at one of the largest table, is camping there. The employees don't seem to care at all that these people are doing this despite them sitting there for hours, but buying anything. Sometimes they'll even be sleeping at the table.
The kid's play area is also really crappy. They have nothing for the kids to play on like a playplace. They have 4 of these really crappy touch screen games things that rarely work properly, or at all. When I was a kid they had a huge playplace, which they took out when they remodeled the store. It even had N64's at one point, along with the playplace. But they took it all out and replaced it with a ""sitting"" place instead of a playplace. It's really awful.
So, all in all, this McDonald's is dirty, has a lot of homeless people that practically live there, and isn't really kid friendly. The food is okay, as long as it's hot food (I get a lot of cold food or my order is wrong), and the employees are generally friendly, but there have been a lot of times where the managers are rather lackluster, meaning that you can tell they don't want to be there. This location needs a lot of work. And they need to do something about the amount of homeless people that hang around in there. There hasn't been a single time I've gone there that there wasn't at least one homeless person there taking up the interactive table that kids want to sit at, with all their dirty things sitting on the table itself. The table is by the front counter, too and you can often times smell the homeless person that's sitting there the whole time you're waiting in line and waiting for your food and while you get your drinks. It is not kid friendly at all at this store. With the store being in a nicer part of town you'd expect quite a bit more cleanliness.",0
"This location was awful today. They rang up our order wrong, then gave it to us still wrong. Took over 15 min to get our order and we had to ask for our drink cups so we could at least get our drinks while waiting. As we stood there, we saw almost every person have a problem with their orders. The person at the register was messing up every order and the back kept making the wrong things. Worst visit ever.",0
"Horrible service. Drive thru speaker was not lit up/broken and when I pulled up to order, I was greeted rudely. I asked if I could order at the window and the lady said ""i guess so."" My order was also wrong and the bacon burger came with no bacon. BAD place to visit during a 3rd shift!!",0
Worst McDonald,0
"No matter the time of day, this location always messes up my order, shorts me or makes me wait wayyyy toooo long.  Will not be going back to this location as I have given them way too many chances and for years nothing has change other then worse service.",0
"Two employees preparing the food simply didn't wear a mask. I am highly dissatisfied with the effort put into enforcing the wearing of a mask. Why during this pandemic, which has not settled in the least, have you not have had a keen eye on employees in order to safeguard the wellbeing of your customers. It's unacceptable to have this lack of care while thousands of healthcare workers are having to work day in and out (With a mask on!) To save lives. Consider this message before you enter this McDonald's (Or any restaurant really) because the meal you get can very well be the deciding factor on whether or not you live in weeks time.
And the fries were luke warm..",0

"Ordered 2 fillet o fish sandwiches after not having McDonald's for  months, ordered Xtra cheese got extra tarter instead. Had it remade got no tarter no extra cheese again. This is why ppl  are mad you make such a high wage. :(",0
The food was at McDonald's standards. But the upkeep of the restaurant was less than average. Garbage cans overflowing. Foot prints all over the floor and the fountain drink dispenser wasn't draining. Its had about an inch of fluid in the waste catcher. You couldn't even set your cups down to fill them up.,0
"Pretty much the definition of ""meh"" and ""ok"" service. Had the unpleasant pleasure of having an older lady by the name of Precious take my order and was just awful. She had the worst ""I don't care"" kind of attitude. Worst yet,  I believe she was the shift last or manager.

Either way,  if you don't care for the customer service, the food is usually on par.",0
"It's 6:15pm, line is SUPER LONG!! Waited a quite of bit of time just to order. So be prepared!!
Food was hot and fresh ( 10 piece nugget meal)",0
Get a veggie burger already!! God!!!,0
I went to this MC Donald's because it is the closest to my home. The food was well below standard. My fish was cold and so we're the fries. From now on I will go to another MC Donald's. This one sucks. And it wasn't the first time.,0
"Everything Very good, but I ask for fresh fries ,and the spanish manager there wanted me to stay with warm fries ,and I said no...fresh fries are fried in the moment...they should be taught to say give us a minute your fries will be fried at the moment... because the customer is very important for us....and period...",0

"Went to grab some breakfast here since Chik Fila looked closed. Placed order for 2 Bacon/Egg/Cheese Biscuits and 3 showed up on the screen and the female on the intercom was quite inconvenienced to correct my order. Waited a minute, but when the items didn't appear on the screen, I said ""Ma'am?"" and her response was ""YEA?!"" in a condescending, scathing tone. I said never mind and got out of there. Heifer needs a reality check.",0

Came here when I first moved to the area, and was given literally rotten lettuce on my quarter pounder that I paid 30 cents extra for. I bit into the rotten lettuce and that how discovered it. I had to talk to the manager and he though making me a new one was fair. Eventually after threatening to rep",0
"Waited over 2 minutes at drive thru pick up window,  gave me drink without straw then was told to pull over and park after waiting. Took over 4 minutes to serve me a swiss/mushroom burger meal. I was the only person in line and only one came behind me. Not sure why I waited over 4 minutes",0
Sick an tired of ordering food and finding out it's wrong when you get home and open it up. I ordered fish with extra sauce.  The box was marked properly so I left with it. Got home and it was about 1 tablespoon.,0

"Loud speaker at drive thru ""Due to technical difficulties we're closed."" Yet someone is getting served right in front of me?? There's a reason yall are called crackdonalds and nobody goes to yall anymore.  Thought with WAWA opening up across the street this would change,  guess i was wrong for trying.",0
It took us 20 mins to get to order and get our drinks...So slow...very disappointing...,0

Regularly not open during listed hours on McDonald's website.,0
"The person who took our order charged us for a large meal and then rang in a small drink. When I questioned the girl giving us our items, she got defensive and accused the drink machine. She argued with us the entire time she was fixing the problems. Never again.",0
Worst McDonalds. The girl at the window had no idea what she was doing. She got an attitude and got her manager because she couldn't handle why we were asking for the new garlic white cheddar burger. Every worker here makes it obvious they don't want to work.,0
It says they're open 24/7 but when I got to the drive through at 1 am they said they're closed,0

"Disappointing. McDonald is my standby for fast food. Normally I get consistent food with decent, sometimes amazing service. I know it not going to the gourmet but better than waiting at an untested restaurant for more expensive and worse food.

Shrink-flation at its best.  Half filled fries. Soda with no refills. Seriously? Especially now that a combo meal costs $9.

At first I thought it was because the restaurant was newer but after looking at these review",0
We were inside a Walmart McDonald's. My granddaughter has food allergies to egg & dairy. So there are only a few things that she can have. We had ordered her a kids happy meal with apple slices but they gave us french fries instead. The beef frying oil has dairy in it so she can not have the french fries and they were all out of apple slices. Next we ordered apple juice. They were all out of apple juice as well. The girl employee that was trying to help us did not believe me that the french fries had dairy in it. A happy meal hamburger and apple slices is all she can have here. Was not happy with the service here. The food and service times are not the same as it used to be.,0
Inside counter served all takeout orders before any dine in customers. Watching customers that ordered over 10mins after myself get theirs first. After getting the food the fries and Big Mac were both ever under cooked. This place shouldn't even be open,0
I visited this location 5/5 at 5:07 pm. The 2 young ladies (black and Hispanic) that was handling the food was very rude and rounding their eyes when I asked for fresh fires. When she handled me the fries with an attitude here you go. First and last time visiting this location. Smh customer service training needed asap,0
"didnt give it 1 star because the food was good but around 4 days ago, i went at night through the drive thru and I gave my McDonald's app code to get the points, i ordered something that was 15 dollars in total and they charged me 31 dollars and the reason for this was that the guy that was taking care of the drive thru applied my McDonald's app code to another car order( my card is linked to the app ) and I ended up paying for their food, i know this because they guy asked my name and when I told him he said something to the manager and I said, yeah I think that car  is using my code , the guy just said "" is your lucky day go to the next window ""  It was late at night so I didn't give it much thought because I didn't know just by giving your code you can get charged  but next day I got surprised when my account got charged twice. Tried calling but they didn't solve my issue this is why I am leaving a review",0
"The manager was rude, I waited for more than 40 minutes, understanding that they were busy.  but everyone who wanted to ask her was stressed.  The worst customer service, additionally, tells me that my refund will be from 5 to 10 days since after 45 minutes waiting.  It only said that there were many orders.",0
"No cashiers/order takers; you must use their self-service kiosk which they have several of. You take a number sign to your table and staff will deliver your order to your table; however, this wasn't the case for us. The employee came from around the counter and yelled our number while she stood in the nearly empty lobby. We were seated less than 6 feet away from her and in her line-of-sight. We raised our hand and said, ""that's us"". She saw us, but made no attempt to deliver the food. I don't mind getting up and getting the food from her despite the kiosk saying it would be delivered to our table, but, I'm feeling a little like an unpaid employee at this point...we placed the order ourselves as well as served ourselves the food despite paying the same amount for the food that a full-service McDonald's charges. Several people in-store and in drive thru returned food due to being cold, old or not made correctly. This included us...at 1:00 in the afternoon the nuggets were cold, chewy and seemed old. I would think this wouldn't be the case given 1:00 p.m. is during the lunch rush. Fries were cold presumably because they were sitting on the tray well before the rest of the food was ready. Double cheeseburger was made correctly (no mustard or pickles), but bun was not warm/dry and cheese was cold/not melted. 4 managers were in the kitchen (button-up shirts with ties) along with 6 employees yet there was a lot of standing around doing nothing and operating with a shuffle-paced, leisurely-stroll walk. I worked at McDonald's and Burger King as a teenager and was always told, ""If you got time to lean, you've got time to clean"", and that was during slow/dead times, not lunch rush. I will say that the manager I returned my double cheeseburger and fries to (we ended up just eating our stale nuggets because we were told it was going to be 5-10 minutes for fresh ones) was nice and when I told her she could just microwave my burger she insisted on making a new one.",0
Visited 6/15/2023 drive through closed at 11:00 pm,0
2 adults ww children breakfast meals. Had to go back to service counter 3 times no eggs in meal. Then again hole in cup hot water everywhere. Then tea bag had hole in so back to counter. Food was cold by time we all sat down to eat. No apologies were given!!!!!,0
"horrific service. this is NOT the ""world's largest McDonald's"" as people are reviewing on here, this is the location on international Dr near the OCCC. ordering at the drive thru took almost 20 minutes (this did not include waiting for the food), the man speaking kept whispering and getting an attitude despite us saying we could not hear him, did not correctly take our order, would just not say anything for multiple minutes at a time. i have never in my life been to a McDonald's with worse service. avoid at all costs",0
Rude and unattentive staff.   They were not even busy and I asked can I order my food at the register basically was told you have to use the kiosk and she walked away from me.  Not offering any type of assistance or making you feel welcome in any way.  I turned around and walked out the door.,0
"Went through the drive-thru and had a pre-order. They rushed us through, they were busy, then when we took a bite we found out that the Sandwiches were completely wrong. Not even worth going back for. It's happened multiple times at this location.",0
"It was a clean and convenient location, but we were quite disappointed with the service and food we ordered.  We clearly specified using the McDonalds app that we wanted a quarter pounder no mustard, no pickles, no onions.  We received a fully loaded quarter pounder.  AND when the lady delivered our app order to our car, she intentionally stopped far enough so we had to reach backwards to get her food.  She made no effort to offer the food.  She made us get it where she was.  McDonalds needs to review procedures with the staff and seek to improve the customer experience there.",0
They have new self serve order kiosks but they are very difficult to navigate. They are not very intuitive at all. My order took three times as long to be brought out. Good idea on the kiosks but very poor execution. While I was waiting on my order they had to come and tell two different people that they were out of what they ordered (fish sandwich and something else). Store was newly renovated inside and out and looked very nice but I will not be back.,0
Rude staff.  Slow food delivery.  Kiosk may save the owner money but it is slow and convoluted.  Not sure why you take a number for table side service and then have to go to counter to pick it up.   Food quality is poor.,0
"Atmosphere is cool and unique. Ordered pasta and cheesesteaks. The wait time was forever, service was definitely slow. But it was also Easter and spring break weekend. But what was odd was that we got our cheesesteaks and waited an extra 30 minutes for our fries and milkshakes. That was weird and frustrating.",0
"Waited to long at drive thru, while other line was moving. App code for deal canceled out and I had to wait for the code to appear again. Crew not helpful at drive thru or inside.",0
Staff stole $250 out of a bag that my little sister had brought absolutely devastated never go here such cheeky and careless staff I am so angry do not go to this McDonald,0
"Do not order here,  the fries were only full and they didn't give me any of my sauces very dissatisfied. When I called at 2:30 am the lady who answered was so rude!!!!",0
How do you go to a McDonald that says 24 hours there,0
The kids wanted it ...the kids loved it they had nuggets and fries....it's McDonald's...the service at drive through is borderline passive aggressive  but you can't complain well it's like say your order and here's your meal...lol but it's McDonald's,0
"Really nice McDonalds but the waiting is horrible, no one is taken the in house orders, only drive thru is being taken care of, I've been standing here for 27 minutes until I got to put in my order, not a word said to me about the wait, only 3 of the 8 desserts have labels. Right next to me a customer brought up a buttermilk crispy chicken that got everything on it except for the chicken. After receiving my order McDonald's employee I was telling waiting customers to use the touch screen, One customer said she didn't know how to use it so she was told by the McDonald's employee to continue to wait. I finally got my order after 39 minutes after coming in through the door.",0
Went through the drive-thru and ordered my food and when it got to the window only charged  for one meal and I had asked for two then had told me to pull over to the side and waited for a long time that forgotten about me. So I had to go back in and tell them about my order. And when I went back to let them know they  gave me look like I was bothering. I've never apologized ....poor management!!,0
"This morning 10/11/2022, went through the drive thru for my breakfast.  Two things medium Hot mocha plain and sausage mcmuffin. Paid and advanced to the next window.  Here is where things went wrong!
The blue shirt manager  ( last name begin with an A) on duty Had a serious attitude.  She did not acknowledge my order so she gave me the wrong order. She gave me a bag with a sandwich and hash brown and walk away as if that was my order. I sat there until she saw me and I told her I am waiting for my coffee . She said the there is no coffee on the order. I showed her the receipt and she walk on to the coffee and gave to me. Now I was going to let everything go until I heard her say these words after asking for napkin to wipe the chocolate OFF THE CUP.  Which is her job .
Her Words loud and clear
""FOR GOD SAKE""
I know I only spent a few dollars but IT don't justify getting attitude because this is your job.
I ask for a refund..",0
"Arrived at the McDonald's at 10:20PM, and the posted hours said the location was open until 12:00AM. An employee locked the door and barricaded it with a trash bin and didn't let us in until we mobile ordered, although another employee seemed confused by this. Another employee was also telling people that the lobby was closed (again, even though the hours stated that the location would be open until 12AM). Additionally, while this happened, there were at least a dozen people sitting down and eating, and there were empty tables.",0
"I퐒e never reviewed a fast food restaurant before because my expectations are never too high anyway. Father Day, drive thru at noon we were seriously in line for 25 mins. This one has two separate planes to order) The order taker was very slow coming to the speaker for all the vehicles, when paying we were barely acknowledged, but the worse was to come. When at the next window to get our food.. the person did not even look at me.. literally just handed a bag out the window, then handed the drink out the same way..partially angled down towards me. Better yet, check out the new crispy chicken deluxe. ",0
"Hours are inaccurate, they close the dining room before 11:00, not midnight as is posted on their doors. The tea also has the distinct taste of coffee, which makes it taste like burnt tea....gross......",0
Didn know you could barricade customers out with trash cans one and a half hours before closi,0
"Please hire employees that actually want to work and like their job and smile this girl that just took my order with extremely long red Nails was very unpleasant. Do you follow a dress code in this establishment? Also this must be the saddest sundae i have ever received, half the Carmel was outside the cup!  Maybe that",0
My kids are big on McDonald and I thought it would be fun for them. Big mistake! Place is a dump and a joke. The food was cold and the facility is filthy. The drink area had no ice in 6 dispensers. No ketchup. The play area was frightenin,0
The worst McD I퐒e ever been to! Waited 30 minutes for our food. They were just overrun with peo,0
"I ordered my food for pick up, and when I walked into the restaurant, it was cluttered with guests meandering about, which I understood the behavior after MY 45 minute wait, that was AFTER I waited 8 minutes to even be acknowledged by an employee. So frustrating, staffing seemed adequate, just a lack of experience in prioritizing from the young manager.",0
"Rude associates, dirty restaurant, I wouldn't bring my dog here to eat, let alone anyone else. Slow, unfriendly and incompetent would sum this place up.  Someone should hang a skunk outside this restaurant because it stinks!",0
"Horrible! I ordered the same meal I always order when I go to McD's. Fish fillet & Fries. There was nothing fillet about my fish, it was dry & stale and so was the fries. So disappointed.",0
"I am a client, I am a tourist, and how is it possible that it is closed and people have to be ordering by walking where the cars go, they expose their clients, an accident can happen, how do I do if I don't have a car like those people did?  How dangerous and disrespectful for customers, I've been coming for 3 days and it's the same it's 7 at night and it's closed but it says it's 24 hours",0
"Dine In is NOT available. I went with family but we had to sit outside. This is the case observed in the evening in majority of outlets. Placed pickup order and manager stepped out and addressed orders one by one.
Burgers are served with ONLY bread and patty and NO vegetables.",0
"Customer service needs some serious work. ""MOBILE APP?"" was the first words out the the drive thru cashier's mouth... not even a ""Welcome to McDonald's""? And the Egg McMuffin bread was hard. Not a good experience.",0
"I ordered a strawberry smoothie, they gave me a mango smoothie instead, I told them I ordered a strawberry smoothie, their crew is very upset. Than she brought me a strawberry smoothie, and told me this is the size for smoothie.",0
"It doesn't work, she's the one in charge and she treats you badly, she insults you and is rude, please educate your staff to be nice",0
"Waited in the drive through, no one said they don't get new orders. Had to step inside to figure it out.",0
Dining room is supposed to be open until midnight.  I showed up at 10:55  and the doors were locked. The employees just ignored us,0
Food was terrible and so much missing. Service even worse !! Like eating at Karen's restaurant in UK ! AVOID AT ALL COSTS !!,0
Went to this location around 3am and placed an order through the app. Waited in the drive thru for 20+ minutes with other cars to then be told they are closed only. The manager refused to refund my order and also refused to give me her name. The manager that works there during the night should not be in management and lacks customer service skills along with the other 3 employees that refused to acknowledge us at the drive thru window. This location needs training from corporate and should not have the open 24 hours a day signs on their windows. Very disappointed in my experience at this McDonald's.,0
Typical mcdonalds I guess. The fries we tossed they were still frozen we watched them dump them in than scoop and fry them kinda gross. Should of been tossed out entirely,0
No chocolate shakes available?!  This location should have good stocks of everything!,0
These people have 2 drive truths but only takes orders from one stood here 15 min got skip 3 times and then was told to have patience,0
The worst I know it's fast food but corp needs to straighten this place out bad service bad attitudes for being so tourist friendly area this was the least friendly,0
"They messed my order up 2 times. They remade my sandwich and the chicken was still raw. They have nasty attitudes. You have to use the kiosk to place your order. There is no more service with a smile. An update I now have food poisoning form the raw/ undercooked chicken I was served yesterday. Don't eat here, I will never come back here ever again. My reviews have been see by over 100,500 people.",0
Disappointing for the largest McDonald's. Most menu's items were unavailable when we came in. Service is subpar. Kids had fun in hame rooms.,0
"This place really should be shut down. If they can't deliver in customer service just close.  I ordered with them and waited for 45 minutes.  I asked them after 10 minutes about my order and they said it's coming up.  After 20 minutes I ask again about my order and the supervisor tells me ""one at a time, I can't skip your order in front of other people"".  She then proceeds to continue skipping my order to serve other people.  At 45 minutes I asked again and she finds my order on a table and says to her coworker they never made it.   Nobody gave an apology or acknowledged they were in the wrong.  If you can't run a restaurant correctly then please just shut down.  There are countless pictures on their reviews of cars piling up and terrible customer service.",0
"They took 17 minutes for my McChicken which feels like it wouldn't take that long, and then they forgot my lettuce on it and the fries were cold, I'm wanting to bet that if I went again it would be better, but with most options out of stock I can't recommend going",0
To hell with this McDonald. They closed their lobby 10,0
Worst McDonalds ever.  No personal service or friendly service.   Stay away and have a good day somewhere else.,0
"These employees don know how to prepare Mobile Orders. You build your order on the phone and pay for everything you added, then the employees give you the wrong thing. I ordered an iced latte with caramel drizzle and whipped cream, I received a regular iced coffee with nothing that I paid extra for. This had happened 3 or 4 times now.",0
Could only order from kiosk. Wanted some extras but serving staff struggled with English,0
"Rude amateur counter staff, asked cleaner a question just pointed me to the front counter without saying a word! more expensive (tourist area)
Overall nice building thats about it.... food arrived to table cold!
Just like being in a Circus....full of clowns",0
Negative review.  One of the busiest locations in Orlando and absolutely no customer service! Everywhere else you can dine in except in McDonalds CRAZY!!!,0
Did an order on the mobile app. Ordered two sweet teas when got to drive thru they told me they had no sweet tea. Had to cancel and place new order for cokes. Drive thru took 45 minutes. Slowest I have ever seen.,0
This review is about the staff at this location. I visited this McDonalds 09/24 around 6:30pm to pick it up my food. My wife did another mobile order and I just arrived and tried to explain to the manager (I think she was) I have another order that was not on the screen. She was rude and answer 퐋ne order at the time?of course the first order arrived and I was still standing waiting for the other one more than 15 min. Another friendly Girl (Danisha I thinks was her name tried to help me out) and the manager stopped her and sent to carry other stuff in the back. She was in charge for drive thru and one Spanish customer was making an order. Danisha asked her to help and she said I can. I was shocked about this,0
"We went in to order and sat down to eat because we had eaten in other restaurants on idrive. We were told that we could not eat there, but way we were told was very rude.",0
Food is terrible but the workers are very polite.,0
"Hawaiian Court location -
Staffing issues really not helping this location live up to the ""Fast Food"" label.
From order to recieving the food, it took 42mins, and even then the order came out wrong.
There was one manager, one fry cook and one burger cook, trying to complete a dinner time rush, yet there were 3 cleaning staff going round cleaning 1 table every 20mins or so.
This team could really do with some logistical training on how to get orders out efficiently and on time, because this really was a poor attempt at ""fast food"".",0
"Brittany (The ""Manager"") was completely rude and wanted to call the cops just because I ordered a cup of coffee and their whole system was down.",0
"RUN AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! We just went through the drive through and the teen girl sounded like she was depressed and going to jump.

We ordered 2 doubles, 2 chicken, 1 large fries and 2 large drinks. Everything, every-thing tasted hard like cardboard. The fries were extremely hot and hard and crunchy like stones. Both the chicken and doubles had no - no - no flavor at all and was dry as sawdust and cardboard. For the sodas one was a diet coke and other was a reg coke, both were large size which they did not get right the first time. Both sodas tasted like they were full of cinnamon flavor.

The food was over dry and tasteless. The staff at this location needs to learn how to throw away yesterday's old food..if not last weeks old junk..

It's almost a guarantee your food will taste horrible And your money wasted.. save yourself time and go somewhere else you will be glad you did!",0
Horrible Service Lazy Workers Took Forever to make my order ans there liars,0
"Terrible service. Cashier had a bad attitude and was very disrespectful. Refused to give her name. Found out it is Brittany. Female manager seemed clueless amd not helpful whatsoever. After over an hour from the time we entered the drive thru til we got our food, it was still made wrong. We've submitted the issue to corporate requesting contact. No response. Obviously they do not care about their customers.",0
"Terrible customer service, the lady at the drive-thru was handing me someone else order after me telling her my order is an online order she then got mad and left the window then the second young lady told me to go to the third window without telling me that they just received my order and is in the process of making it. I called the store and the manager was nasty after I was just telling him that Communication would have been nice and yelling at me telling me I don need to tell him that and I asked for corporate number and the lady said they don have it and I asked for her name and she walked away quickly from me rude everyone here is rude and disrespectful and no communication with there customers.

I would recommend going to a different location that mo",0

"Only giving one star because zero stars isn't an option. Wanted to pay cash at register and was told to use kiosk. Kiosk never gave an option for cash pay. Employees wandering the store on their phones and ignoring customers. When asked for napkins an employee went thru two other employees instead of just handing customer napkins. No organization at all and rude as can be. Gave me diet soda, when I asked for regular they rolled their eyes. I understand it's busy but this place could be handled better. Go anywhere but here.",0
Twice they've forgotten loads of my order on uber eats! No refunds. Nothing. Absolutely a joke,0
"When you go on slow Thursday night, order yourself a nice Double Quater pounder with  cheese to go after a long days work. Only to see you get a single quater pounder, No cheese, and i guess they decided to throw in some lettuce on there? No sauce like 5 pickles....  Too tired to go get a refund :c",0
"Granted we at a busy time of the evening (SeaWorld was getting ready to close), but the lobby to thus McDonald's was locked even though all the signs clearly indicated they were supposed to be open for lobby hours. The drive-thru was open, but it was exceedingly slow. The service was poor, and the products we ordered were sub-par (even for McDonald's standards, which is saying something). We ended up just throwing some of it away. I typically do not leave negative reviews. I am hoping that they were just short-staffed the night we went.",0
"Although conveniently located to several hotels, the hour wait to get my order shows incapability to handle the extra patronage. They are not adequately staffed to handle the extra flow of being centrally located. Even when we were at the window, it seems they were still scrambling to put our order together. Once back the hotel, we discovered that one of our orders was wrong! They placed bacon on one of the fish sandwiches!",0
"My friends and family were denied service at this location because we prefer to place our order with a human rather than a kiosk.  1st by an employee then by the manager! VERY  RUDE!
10.9.22 11:20 am.",0
@McDonald's corporate you need to investigate this location immediately. The customer service is highly lacking and I'm positive the management of that location is damaging your brand. Not only is service extremely slow but the drive through service provider and the manager is horrible. We literally witnessed people driving away from the intercom after waiting and waiting with no response. We drove up to the intercom and waited and waited. Zero response. We spoke multiple times. No reaponse. No one greeted us. No one asked us to wait. Nothing. Radio silence. Then we dro e up to window only to face a combative manager with a chip on his shoulder. Needless to say we drove away without making an order. It was an experience that definitely does not live up to the world renowned brand standards of McDonald's.,0
"We had a great dat at SeaWorld with the gkids and decided to swing by and get ice cream for them on the way home.  Well we get there and there is a line out the door because only one of the 6+/- kiosks are open.  We wait in line for 30min and as my wife gets to order they shut it down to only drive thru.   Absolutely horrible customer service and the lack of care from the manager was disgusting and extremely disappointing!  Never would I say this company is a favorite of mine, but now, I never plan to visit again!!!!!",0
"This is easily the worst McDonalds experience I've had. Waiting an hour for fast food in what can only be described as a dirty, chaotic nightmare. Staff are totally disorganised and management seems non-existent. Only getting 2 stars because when we eventually forced them to cook our food as we waited blocking the counter, it was piping hot and pretty delicious.",0
"Waited in drive-thru for 30 mins, finally got up to order & nothing. We kept asking if anyone is there. Kid finally comes on that they had to reboot the system & could be another 15 mins at least. We told him he needs to tell people as there is a line around the building. Truly horrible service.",0

"I ordered breakfast at 8:34 January 16, 2022 (order# 1386 order 86). We could have ate breakfast at the resort we are staying at but my family elected for McDonald instead. Not only did I have to wait an extended period (three to five minutes) at the order board but we had a large order. When I got up to window number one the girl working the window was rude, did not want to allow me to review my large order with her, spoke extremely fast and unprofessional then rushed me to the next window without even paying. Once I drove to the next window I was handed my food (still hadn paid) tried reviewing the order again and the woman didn listen or pay me any attention. I sat patiently and she rushed back to the window to collect payment AFTER everything was given to me. Our re under cooked (mushy) but the rest of or breakfast was good.

It's not actually a 24-hour store. They're open but if you go at night around 3:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. it's going to be closed I think they switch for a dinner to breakfast but it's unfair for people who work third shift like myself. I can almost never get McDonald's. It's funny cuz they also barricade all the doors and drive throughs.,0

With the size of the big breakfast that would starve a child. Maybe you should start calling it baby breakfast. If you don't get cakes with it then you have over half a tray of just a bite of eggs two small strips of bacon and a dry/hard biscuit. I think a total of six bites and two minutes with phone in hand while eating and it was gone. There goes almost ten bucks.,0
"Zero starts!
All tables were unattended. They were all dirty. Food took a while. Manager was yelling at staff to hurry up with food. I stood for a few minutes ready to place my order. I was the next client. No one. I mean. Not a soul greeted me, acknowledge my presence or anything. Not even an exchange of words when I got my food (which I had to order online from inside the restaurant because no one was there to help me). Not a you're welcome when I said thanks. Nothing!!! I would not come here again.",0
Absolutely horrible place. After waiting 40 minutes we had to ask how much longer. The first lady looked at the orders then ignored me. The manager finally came and couldn't even find my order. The workers were just yelling over each other and at costumers. Never got all our food and was upset with this place we just had to leave. Will never go back and we frequently are in Orlando.,0

"I placed an order through the 'improved' kiosk system and over 15 minutes later had to inquire about it. Turns out the order had been completed but staff were 'busy with other dutys'; so it just sat there. So much for customer service. However, the shift leader did apologize. Honestly, I'd rather have hot food. And once in my vehicle, I discovered the order was not even correct. Failure level = complete.
My first time in a McDonald's in almost 10 years. Now I remember why. Given the choice, I have no need to return to McDonald's; ever.",0

Restaurant looked to be short staffed which I understand and there was an employee there that was fairly new it seemed which was also fine. My issue came with the TWO managers that were ""taking care of the guests"". Zero communication to anyone about what the wait was about. I deduced that I was waiting for pies because I heard the crew talking about it. These 2 managers were more concerned about what they were doing later and how one typically doesn't work weekends. Did not Apologize or attempt to communicate anything to any guests. The worse part is as the food finally came up they tossed my bag to me and walked away. I hop that this is not typically how business is done there but my goodness...",0
worst service i,0
"Massively understaffed. 25+ min wait for food. Also got the order wrong. Corporate needs to sack up and pay their people more because the world is on fire, inflation is rampant, and end times are near. Also every fat, miserable, Disney-going family you'd never want to run into frequents this place. Avoid at all costs",0
They will NOT TAKE YOUR ORDER inside UNLESS you use their self serve kiosk. I shouldnt have to say I cannot see the screen for someone to take an order. Why have the front counter if its self checkout at ALL times. It is not busy. I just left and went to get food from someone else. Why is that the only way to order. I work and live near here but will definitely not be back nor my coworkers.,0
"Extremely unreliable. Not enough staff to run the store. Sometimes no drive thru, sometimes OBLY drive thru. This is stupid considering there more people",0
"For me to give them a start is too much I went. several time there and the foot is awful, the chicken nugget.the cold and old and I asked the lady the next time I went around if she can please make sure that the nuggets are fresh. She reply fresh you want them fresh. And I replied please. Do I pay at the window pick up my order the one I drove away. I grabbed one of the nuggets and that look and feel like they were sitting since the next day I have to throw my food away never again.",0
Ordered using their self serve machines. Sat at the table as per the instructions on the machine. Waited 15 minutes. No food. Politely asked the manager behind the counter and they had missed our order and thought it had been prepared. No apology just a rude manager telling us to sit down and it will be be brought to us,0
"Easily the worst fast food experience. My girlfriend and I were feeling sick from needing to eat something and stopped here. Location is 24hr but the doors were locked to stop ppl coming in. A customer let us in and we were greeted to customers demanding refunds, ridiculous wait times, and them being out of many items. Staff is very rude and condescending, and the place is very poorly managed.",0
This is my first time coming here and they made our order perfect then we ordered a waffle and we waited 1 hour for the waffle and the worker had the audacity to say do still want to wait for the waffle or a refund I said a refund and I was mad while walking out I don,0
Every vehicle that ordered was told to move into a parking space to wait for their food. Why not just allow everyone to wait at the window if service is so slow. The other thing that set me off is they had a lady in her late 70's bring the food out. She did so with a loving warm smile but I only hope they take care of her when the younger fit employees clock in. No offense she was a sweet heart just worried.,0
"Dirty store, waited 45 minutes for our food and never received it. We left. I would like my $30 back. No origination, worst McDonald's I've ever been to.",0
"Do not eat here, save yourself, time and money. I ordered here 5 times in a month and every time it was wrong. you would think I would learn. I tried to make it easy on them and ordered my burgers plain. Thinking the less work the better. Nope some how plain means ketchup only. Another time they put tartar sauce on my cheese burger. The managers tell you if you have a problem to just call the McD's number to complain. I am local so I have choices to eat at other places. You know what Wendy's is sounding a lot better these days. It's not even a short staff problem, its a I don't care problem. I must be a slow learner but trust me this McD ruined it for all others. losing my $45 order each trip wont hurt then in the short term. But over a long time it will and will make sure I let others know to for go McD and go somewhere else. STAY AWAY!",0

"So rude i asked a question i couldnt find the answer to online and the girl asked me if i knew what google was before hanging up on me. Kept hanging up on me and everytime i called back there was a new girl claiming to be the manager, and they are all disgustingly rude. Im actually shocked by how they treat other humans like this. I came in earlier at 8:30 and the guys working there were very nice, but calling at 11:30 pm i was not treated even decently by all the girls in there. The people here act like you퐒e killed there family members or something. Learn to act like a normal human being or go back to your moms basement and get out of customer service you disgusting humans. My cousin also left a ",0
Chicken nuggets were ice cold and disgusting the French fries it was like they poured 1/2 bucket of salt on them. This is not the first time I've encountered cold overly salted food,0
"Very bad service, I have ordered and want to pay cash, the atender won come to get the payment, she says",0
"Ignored me at the counter then told me i had to order at the kiosk when i asked, then walked away. I have tried in the past, but my special order,  can not be accomplished on the kiosk, even the workers had me go to the main counter. So i did to not get what i wanted this time. Bad service. Plus, during covid not everyone shouldn't be using the same touch screen, i didn't feel safe.",0
Too crowded inside and in the drive-thru. Did not get a chance to eat there. Looks nice though.,0
"We ordered custom burgers (no pickle), (ketchup,onions, add lettuce.) After we paid, waited five minutes to get our food. It was cold. Wanted to add a hot fudge sundae. Was told they didn hav",0
Dining closed early with no updates online. 48 minutes in the drive through at the end they dont have what we want f off . So bad experience.  Such a loser team.,0
"Asked for an iced caramel latte, and they gave me an iced coffee. Went back and payed AGAIN for an iced caramel latte, and they gave me a cup with pure white milk only and no caramel at all. Is it that hard to make a latte?",0
"When I first pulled up to get breakfast at 533am the man told me to come back in 10mins. I said ""what is this? You mean I can't order food right now? Yall start breakfast from 5am and go until 11am!"" He said ok you can order, but food won't be ready for at least 5min. What was weird is soon as I ordered, my food was already ready. This particular McDonald's is way to busy and big to be pulling slack workers like that. The guy seemed like he just didn't want to help.",0
"I came in at 10, the drive through line was so long and I saw 2 families eating food inside. I decided to go in as it said the lobby hours are until 11.  I knocked on every door wondering if anyone was going to open up the door, but no. The worker shook her head at me sternly and wouldn even give me the explanation as to why she wouldn open the door. Mind you I also was in my military uniform and she went out of her way to disrespect me, all she would have had ",0
"Total dump.  Long,  unreasonable waits.  The dining room was filthy.  Missing sauce for nuggets. No lids for the cups.  No napkins.  It's like dining in the third world.",0
I can't even give them a star.  We had to order 4 times after sitting in line for over 45 mins- they still got it wrong.  Their team needs training severely.  We ended up working with the manager and he did give us the food free- spouse and teenage found it inedible.,0
"This particular McDonald's was incredibly slow.

My chicken sandwich was overcooked and dry and they didn't put the pickles on it.

Overall it took over 15 minutes in the drive through to get my food.

Not a great showing from a place that is not expected to be great.",0
"This place is awful
The lines are looooong inside or drive through being waiting for 45 minutes for 2 happy meals
I think is one of the slowest in the state.
Needs lots of work hopefully management gets involved and fix the deficiencies",0
"Both online and the sign here says they are 24hr. Tried coming in to get some food for my kids last night after a 7 hrs road trip. They had shut down the drive through and doors. When I CALLED THE STORE AND ASKED THE MANAGER HUNG UP IN MY FACE 2 TIMES. WHEN ALL I WAS ASKING WAS WHAT TIME DO THEY CLOSE AND WHY DOES IT SAY 24 HOURS IF YOUR SHUT DOWN?!?!?

THEN I PROCEEDED TO CALL THE NEXT MORNING AND ASKED TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER, EXPLAINED WHAT HAPPENED TOLD HER ID LIKE THE MANAGER NAME FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE TO REPORT IT TO COORPRATE, SHE THEN TOO HUNG UP IN MY FACE TOO!!!

THESE ARE THR MANAGERS ACTING LIKE THAT ? IM FAR BEYOND DISSAPOINTED AND I WILL BE STILL REACHING OUT TO COORPRATE.  THEY DONT DESERVE THEIR JOBS AT ALL, SOMONE ELSE WOULD REALLY NEED THAT JOB AND TREAT THE CUSTOMERS PROPER .",0
"If I could give 0 stars I would. We got turned away at the drive thru because they stated, ""we are short staffed and really busy, we can't take any more orders for 20 minutes"" and when I asked if I could wait in the drive thru, they told me no because the drive thru is timed and it would time out. I understand being short staffed and running behind on orders, thats understandable, but telling people you're not taking orders for the next 20 minutes.. I mean come on, I am not sure who is managing this location but turning away business? Seems like a poor business practice to me. This happened on 10/17 at 1030 by the way.",0
McDonald is already a horrible franchise with horrendous service but this location is SO bad that I wanted to write this review to advise NOBODY to come to this location. The service is a joke. The food always comes out wrong. The staff is not fr,0
"This place is terrible!  They have no inside seating...  which, I guess happens.  But the manager on duty this morning, when asked about the seating simply waved my wife off and shooed her away without even taking her cell phone from her ear...   shameful...  we just wanted to have a quick bite before getting on the road on the tail of the tropical storm.  The one bright light was the very sweet and friendly young lady that took our order.   Wish I knew both names so that I call them out, both good (for the young lady) and BAD (for the manager lady on duty).",0
"Incredibly slow service, sat in the drive-thru for at least 10 minutes without the line moving. When I finally got my food, the crispy chicken sandwich tasted stale, the texture was very chewy and not crisp at all; on top of that, I wasn't asked if I wanted any ketchup or sauces, the sandwich didn't have a drop of mayonnaise or anything on it, just oddly dry pickles, and a soggy bun. I had to park and go inside to get condiments. As has become almost expected with the McDonald's experience, the soda tasted like sanitizer. Never again at this location.
I only stop at McDonald's if I am blindingly hungry, on the verge of passing out, and still my past 3 experiences at three locations around Orlando have been disgusting.

Update: Got food poisoning, and this is the last thing I ate.",0
"McDonald's just needs to SHUTDOWN!!  Every McDonald's in the Orlando area....none EVER open on time, systems are ALWAYS down, CASH ONLY in the early morning hours IF you can find one that is ACTUALLY OPEN.  Sign on door states open at 5:00am...and at 6:05am, still closed.",0
"Was so excited for my first time coming to he big McDonald ?because I was told you could order special menu items. First disappointment. Second, not only were there no numbers to grab once you ordered your food, but we waited over an hour for a ham and cheese French toast, (that we watched sit in the window under a heater that wasn even working for over 20 mins) a McDouble and Big Mac and a frozen coffee (that was half melted). Very disappointing. Will NEVER go back. The employees were all chi",0
Literally the worst McDonald's I've ever been to,0
"We waited for 50 minutes in the drive through. The line moved at the beginning, but then stopped completely near the order box. Because of the way the cars are channeled through a curbed path we couldn't escape. We were trapped and had no choice but to sit and wait. It was very frustrating. The order we received was correct but we didn't get any apology or explanation. We'll Mark this location on the map and never go here again.",0
"Thank you for the cold breakfast. Made me wait almost 40 minutes. Families got theirs before my lil sandwich and coffee. They just forgot about my meal and let it sit. Only thing warm was the coffee,barely.
Not anyone",0

"Rainy first night in Orlando, we went here after a super long day at Disney World. We waited over 20 min for our food in the drive thru! None of our order was correct and it was pouring rain so I did not want to go back through the slow drive thru. I mean McDonald's is what it is, but people go there for quick and convenient and those components were def missing on this particular visit. 占쏙",0
"I waited 20 minutes until I got my food but the order was completely wrong. I ordered two double cheeseburgers and I got one with two patties and a glob of ketchup on it. The other just had a party with two dry pieces of bread on it. The fries were colder than a dead body in a freezer. What an absolute joke of a kitchen staff. Just a bunch of high school dropouts that cant even make a sandwhich correctly. If your reading this, just go buy some burgers and bread and make one yourself.",0
"They made me wait in the drive thru parking lot line and still forgot my order that saysdd cheese? This has happened twice, yet they still give me the bag with the add cheese stamp on it with false advertising that it is has cheese. I am paying for extra cheese and not getting it on my food, it ridiculous and stealing honestly. This is the third time this has happened. Will be calling c",0
They certainly need to take a look at the way they are staffing the night shift. This location seems to be very popular at night and yet the management has barely anyone back there making orders. There was a giant mob waiting at the register's for their orders. Be smarter with your manning.,0
"Rudest staff ever. I literally just wanted water, I asked how to get water and this lady just muttered something and pointed somewhere. So I asked another employee and was straight up ignored. Tear this place down, it ain't working.",0
"Very rude employee taking orders"" slammed the window in my face and left and  didn't charge me, also called the manager and the manager was worst than the employee, beware of this location this people are rude and very far from being polite- horrible experience, staffsocks.",0
Took over half an hour to received food and it was stone cold staff looked demoralise when asked a member of staff about my food she just looked at me and walked away would never go there again spent over $90 dollars for poor service and food.,0
"I am here in Orlando on vacation and I ordered via Uber eats and when I got my order the happy meal had no fries. My large fries were half empty, cold and soggy. My deluxe chicken sandwich was cold as well. I ordered a large sprite with it and it was flat and didn taste right. Tha",0
Sometimes high tech doesn't mean faster. Location has multiple self service kiosk meaning instead of taking orders one at a time you have several being made simultaneously. Causing a backup waiting to get food inside while competing with drive-thru. Location still does not offer dining inside after ordering food. They had just mopped with 20+ customers inside so that was a safety hazard. Not to mention I overheard someone tell one of the employees that something was broke in the ladies restroom causing water on the floor.,0
Service at this place is a joke. Sat in the drive threw for 20 minutes waiting of my food. The tea is bad 60 percent of the time. I believe this falls directly on management. As there are always new employees there. Most times having poor attitudes. Also I have never once been suggested a pie. I don't even bother pointing it out as it would only take longer. And probably be un edible. I only stop in there maybe once a month when I'm in a bind.,0
"I'll start with the positive: The food I received was the correct order and it was hot. The bad: What was supposed to be a 10 minute trip ended up being almost 40 because they were severely understaffed, and constantly giving out the wrong food to everyone. Maybe they're better during the day, but definitely stay away from the midnight shift if you're looking to get in and out.",0
"Open 24 hours, but not before 6am?",0
"Terrible service, waited forever for our food, Won't be back.",0
OMG!!!...The WORST McDonald's I have EVER been in. Orders were on the board and they were just standing around like the had nothing to do. Drive thru was closed so everyone had to come inside to place their order. This was my first and last time I will NEVER eat at this location. No sense of urgency from the manager on duty as well!!!,0
"Largest and slowest in the world. Took 25 minutes from when I drove up till I left. Took 15 minutes to get my food after I paid. Also I did not get a ""good morning""or anything except 739. The cost of my food. Extremely bad service and attitudes from everyone I encountered there. All for 2 sausage biscuits and a coffee.",0
I would give 3.5 stars for the sugar free caramel iced coffee and 1 star for the sausage burritos. The burritos were very small half the normal size and very little filling or cheese inside. It's been a year since I had a sausage burrito and McDonald's has definitely gone downhill. Prices are higher for the burrito and you get less food for the money.,0
"Waited almost 30 minutes to get my food, while people with bigger orders that came after me, got their food. When asked what was taking so long, they said they are working on the order, then followed by asking me what my order was. After wards, had another employee who knew what was going on come out to ask me again what order was, had to stand there and watch them put my food into a microwave. The worst experience ever.",0
"Visited 3 times over a week during a conference. This place is a shambles. The self-ordering system seems good until you realize that everything after is shambolic. Twice out of those 3 times it's taken more than 30 minutes to get a simple order, and it's not even been busy. The staff (especially the manager Martha) is aggressive and disengaged. Overall a truly terrible 'fast' food location.",0
"Started with me having to get the attention of the Drive thru by saying hello to the order com because 2 cars had passed on my right while i was waiting. Then I pulled up to receive my order I was given my drinks but was missing the one from my Happy Meal order as I asked for it and the person at the window looked at me like what was I talking about I said that i am missing a drink and again he looked at me like I was tring to get something again i mentioned that i have 3 orders with a beverage and a frap but i am still missing one then he began to say ok it is coming just pull forward to the next window as i pulled forward they brought me my items and still no drink and was still missing items again they looked at me like i did not know what i was saying and then finally got my HM drink but i was still missing items was told they are in the oven again waited 10 min with no one coming to the window to inform me of the wait I went to the window where thire was a person and again he was confused on why i was still in there line waiting on food, then the manger came to the window asking what is the problem I said I am still missing my apple pies he being to tell me they are in the oven and it takes 10 min I asked am i still waiting at the other window or am i pulling to a number lane he said no next window so I pull back up and wait another 7 more min I have now been waiting 20 min for my items.  If it was communicated that the wait will be a long wait, I would not have felt forgotten at the window.",0
Beagle was old and hash browns cold,0
"Prices are way too high, got pulled forward only to wait an extra 20 minutes. Still no food. Went inside to ask for a refund. Food still wasn't ready. Ask what the hell was going on and the cow behind the counter said ""oh our bun toaster is broken"".  Didn't say that at the window!! This is an I DRIVE location. Absolutely ridiculous. Stay away. What a waste.",0
Took over a hour for my order and they need a PC system to let people know their orders are ready. THEY NEED MORE HELP,0
"Service is slow and painful, lost McDouble Bundle option on menu for budget minded customers. Still giving it 2 stars, because employees aren't paid enough to say, ""Have a Good Day"" when you getting order at pick up window.

Change my mind next time I drive through and you'll get more stars...

Like what you see? Just say... OYE!

"One of the worse McDonalds I have ever been to.  There is no welcomes or thank you.  Service treats you like you are a problem for them, ie: the server placed the food on front of the customer and started to walk off, the customer said what about my drink.  The server rolled her eyes walked away, brought the drink back reached through the screen put the drink down and walked away.  No I am sorry, no have a nice day.  For me it took over 7 minutes to just get a milkshake.  Never Again for me.",0

"To whom it may concern. Your curb at the entrance of Hawian Bvld at International Drive is dangerous to cars turning right to park. The curb extends to far out to the drive and is blind to drivers in SUVs are high sitting vehicles. I can tell by the damage to the curb, that I'm not the first to experience this and damaged was caused. As a suggestion you may want to paint the curb bright red or install a Yellow caution post to alert drivers. The right think to do would be to correct it.",0
I could not recommend this place. We pulled up to the drive thru at 10:48 pm and the guy behind the speaker said just go ahead with your order with the most unpleasant tone. When I asked if I could have just a sec he replied again in an unpleasant tone well we close in 2 mins. So clearly they didn't want our business and something tells meet they won't want yours. Save your time and go elsewhere.,0

Ordered curbside. The attendant came out to tell me that my apple pie would take 15 minutes and he couldn't cancel it. He said he can substitute for cookies. 15 minutes later I had my order with cookies and still no apple pie. Frustrating. Their soft drinks are always hit or miss as well because the balance of syrup and water is never correct,0
"Sign on door says drive thru open 24hrs and there is signage under the McDonald's ""M"" by the street that says open 24hrs. They are NOT 24hrs, they open at 5. The lady working inside was annoyed that I was trying to get service at 445 and rolled her eyes when I pointed out incorrect details. Need to fix their information.",0
"Absolutely the slowest service I've ever had at a fast food restaurant.  Me and my 3 friends went and we all used the kiosk to order our individual meals.  After 45 minutes and having to talk with the manager we finally got our food.  There was one person working fries, one cook, on manager assisting the cook, and one employee who was supposed to be putting the orders together and delivering to the customers.  The last person walked around like a zombie who had no idea what planet they were even on.  He would pick up a bag occasionally and put it back down and the clear orders from the system and not give anything to the customers. Then when customers complained he would ask them what they ordered and the try to find food for the. After seeing that 3 customers who ordered 20+ minutes after me and my friends I asked to speak with the manager. He proceeded to lie and said that once and order has been on for a while the automatic delete off the que.  So he had no idea what any of us ordered. We had to give him a receipt and the he helped us 10 minutes later. All the trash cans were over flowing into the floor and the restaurant was very dirty.   All the employees including the manager didn't even look 18 years old. They were definitely under trained, mis managed, and probably under staffed.",0

I guess they got to rip off their guests to afford the building the management staff are rude when you order a shake medium it comes in a little small kids cup I order two Filet-O-Fish fish or they're not offering the 2 for 5  but that's okay they're not even putting tartar sauce on the sandwich I was just bread  the Fish so I guess they had to cut  cost somewhere when they charge you $15 for fish and don't put anything  on it. I won't go back. Here is how to save some money fire some of those managers that are rude for your guests and that'll save you some money and start building the sandwich correctly,0
"Went inside to order because wife was dealing with kids.  No line ordered at kiosk right away.  15 workers and no one working.  Manager walking around say hello to customers and no one working. 17 minutes to get 4 egg McMuffins at 8 am
Worst service ever",0
"Another experience.

I was asked to wait at drive thru. No other customers were in queue. They forgot about me. The order was reduced without telling me. The apple pies were removed without any explanation. When I called to report the issue a woman who answered the phone saying she was the manager didn't identify herself. She was rude and short and when I asked for her name she wouldn't provide it. Bad experience with the food too. The fries were so over salted I couldn't eat them and the big mac had so much lettuce and sauce on it I was wondering what happened in the kitchen. End to end bad experience.

Hello I came to your restaurant this morning and waited an extremely long time and was ignored by your staff. I waited at the drive thru order kiosk, then at the payment window and then at the pick up window. Your staff saw me waiting making eye contact several times but continuing to ignore me. I moved back to the payment window and waited while several cars pulled up waiting too. When Mitzy who had ignored me finally opened the window was really dismissive with her demeanor before taking my order. I asked why she saw me and continued to make me wait. Her response was I just put on the headset. Seriously that was her response. There were at least four of the staff who saw me so I am really frustrated with your customer service. Why didn't she acknowledge that she kept me waiting and just apologized for the delay like a normal person. I was really offended that she was so flippant when I asked her about making me wait. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE and lack of basic human kindness. NOT LOVING IT.

Visited again on 3/17/2018 and had the same experience. Even the white shirt manager ignored me.",0
"The service was TOTALLY slow and it took the clerk about 5 minutes before they could even take an order.  I'm a local and I wouldn't ever go back to this location again. Seemed like a LOT of chaos happening when I looked in the kitchen area.  Also, clerks do NOT have a basic understanding of English. This is difficult if you're trying to ask anything of the clerk.  Would not recommend.",0

The girl at counter looked at me like I was dumb the entire time I tried to order and seemed like she didnt have a clue how to answer any question I asked.

"The worst McDonald's in the area. I have lived close to this McDonald's for a little over a year now and have yet ever had a good experience. My order is either not accurate or the food is unacceptable. Also the team members and management just don't seem  to care. I'm not usually one to complain about things because I do realize this is a fast food restaurant, however this last visit has really ticked me off, I couldn't even place my order because the person taking orders in the drive thru was so incompetent, and then she wanted to act like she couldn't hear me. Other times I have visited this location,  I have had an issue where items were left off my order, so brought the food back to have it all replaced because by the time I got home and had to drive back to pick up my missing items, it would all be cold. I asked for my order to be remade and I legit watched this manager put my sandwich in the microwave ... I could understand if I had a huge order to be replaced but it was honestly 3 items. With that said I will not be back to this McDonald's location ever.",0
Severely understaffed for such a busy location. I've seen McDonald's with more workers in locations in the middle of nowhere. Expect to wait at least an hour for food and make sure to check your order before leaving as I and at least half of the patrons I saw leaving came back missing something.,0
"Took more than 30 minutes in drive thru with 5 cars ahead of me. Not only the slowest McDonalds ever, but by far the slowest McDonalds I have ever been to.",0
"Ordered 2 cheeseburgers with no pickles. I got 2 burgers with no cheese and pickles. The establishment itself was clean kept and had a nice interior update to it. The soda machine is a touch screen and you can add flavor shots to it if you'd like. So, if you like Russian Roulette, this might be the McDonalds for you.",0
"We were not impressed with this location. They locked the doors at lunch and only ran the drive-through. We made it inside, but that wasn't much better. The workers were not friendly and I had to order at a kiosk.",0
McDonalds International Drive had really terrible customer service. Not sure what's hard about ice cream in a cup but they were determined to charge us for a sundae and could not have been less cooperative. Chick-fil-A this is why I love you so much.,0
If you prefer to talk to a person then DO NOT go to this location. They only take orders made by kiosk in the dinning room.,0
"Worlds worst McDonald's. Went there on may 7th 2021 at approximately 11pm pizza was closed ,play are arcade closed,  ordered food to eat in tables dirty, asked several times to get it cleaned, and to get better in had to stand on a line for 35 minutes to get my drink because they wouldn't bring it to the table what a joke Spanish manager was a witch to be nice I say nasty nasty and a joke to run it like this she had no care",0
"This is the worst run McDonald's I have EVER seen in my life, the service is super slow. Its complete chaos. The manager should be immediately terminated along with the rest of the useless staff. I would rate it zero but that wasn't an option.",0
"If I could give this place zero stars I would after my experience here tonight. The employee (manager) handling the front end was the rudest individual I've ever met of all my visits to McDonald's in my 30 years. Her attitude got her confronted by several of the customers waiting for food. One lady said she'd been waiting on her food for over an hour. They wouldn't even accommodate her with a refund. Infact my order $25 took 40 min to fill. The store shut down the kiosks, as well as the drive through window to attempt to fill orders of those waiting in the lobby. I understand it's easy to get overwhelmed but when you're filling orders for customers that have just ordered while you have customers that have been waiting on food for nearly an hour, your prioritizing methods are failing. And combining that with the attitude of the manager on duty at the time will result in a lot of unhappy customers. I'm on vacation and will most likely never be in this restaurant again. But if I were a local, they would have just received their last $25 from my pocket. My recommendation on would be to avoid the smaller McDonald's in down town orlando, the management  lacks in people skills and the whole establishment functions as a team poorly. The girl running the fries and the font end had better people skills and prioritized better than either member of management on duty. McDonald's, I'd fix this ladies attitude or I'd find her replacement.",0
All that technology and they can't remember how to put two sandwiches in a bag. Maybe if they had a few more people instead of LCD screens?,0
Drive thru 10 minutes to get to screen to order. Then no one to take order for another 5 minutes. Can't get out of line. Trapped!  Such slow service. Sort of silly for this newly updated McDonald's to be poorly run or staffed.,0
26min in queue is when the manager tells me i have to make my order in one of the machines because she doesn't have someone who can take my order. Really sad i waist my time and did not get my strawberry shake. International Driveway to busy for this time of the day. They need more personal.,0
"I wish there were warning signs on the drive in. Turn back now- unless you have 30 minutes to wait in the drive thru to order, pay and receive your food. Once you pull in and someone comes up behind you, you are stuck..... Hopefully you don't want any Coke with your meal. And forget any all day breakfast items that will add an additional 20 minutes on to your wait. Haven't even tasted my food yet. Do not recommend.",0
Service and costumer service awful horrible!!,0
"I tried to use a coupon to get a free medium fries from the Mcdonald app along with my other items i purchased and after the scanned the coupon they gave me small fries. I even heard them making comments about the free coupon. Also the women at the window seem to be fooling around too much hence the extremely long line during lunch and dinner times. I stopped by 4 times in one week and had an issue each time.

The young white guy at the first window is really nice though hence the 2 stars instead of 1",0
"Took forever, which I've gotten used too, being a very popular location close to the tourist traps of international drive. But the service and order quality has been way less that satisfactory more times than I could count. And not to forget, neither of my kids of my kids even got the ""Pokemon toy"" or any toy for that matter that they asked for.",0
"Absolute worse McDonalds I've ever been to.  Restrooms were a mess, ordered food, gave up after 30 minutes and gave receipt to some other folks waiting for their order.",0
Soda machine on drive thru window was broken on 12/01/2018 at  around 10:30pm. The person who was taking the order was kind enough to give me the option to go inside with the cup and use the machine inside but his manager told him he could not offer me that option therefore I was unable to buy a soda. Great Management Skills.,0
"Was awful at this location!!!! FILTHY!!! Had staff just moving trays of trash around from table to table.. The self pay was out of order, took 15 minutes for someone to notice we were at the registers to pay, with only 2 other customers in the restraunt. Even (while patio obviously ""designed"") patio was horrendous. Trash everywhere, spilled drinks on every table. Very sad since this location I'm sure sees a lot of visitors.",0
"Terrible service.  Poorly run.  3 out of 4 kiosks were down for ordering. This was the only option to order at 11pm at night on a Sat.  Place was very busy, no cashiers on the line.  Took a number for food to be delivered.  Called receipt to pick up order at counter.  Order wrong.  Forgot Cookie and drink cup.  Had to go back up to ask for it.  Counter person did not apologize.   I will never come back here.",0
"Service was incredibly slow, they were out of coke, dr. Pepper didn't work, and they have light lemonade instead of normal. All while we were in a hurry to get to the park.  Very unpleasant experience.",0
"Giant line in the drive through, had to wait for about 5 minutes per car and after about 15 minutes we decided to not order there.",0
I could have gave 5 stars if it stayed original. I liked the safari jungle vibe. I went with my girlfriend on July 13th at night time. It wasn crowded and surprised that they renovated and got rid of golden women bathroom ,0
Arrived starving from water park.30 minutes after ordering large order of food( no deals on that was on other branches) still no food so asked staff who said would look into it. 45 minutes later one staff arrived with sandwich only out of 4 meals and desserts saying rest coming. 1 hour later rest of order arrived no desserts and on checking burger brought was wrong. Went down to complain so called manager shrugged shoulders said other stuff sent up and was attitude of so what that was terrible service. Half machine for kids to play upstairs broke and ridiculous amount of tickets to get smallest prize. Will never be back. If u want mcdonalds go to smaller local branch as will have deals and hopefully better service.,0
"I couldn't tell you much about the food or service because it wasn't open. Supposedly 24 hour location but closed for maintenance.  The sign had been updated closed from 11pm to 4am and then changed again to 5am. I gave up hope at 5:20am when it didn't look like it was going to happen.  Oh well, good luck!",0
Went new year's Eve and was a disaster!!! 4 employees in the heart of tourist district..We ordered at Kiosk and waited 15 mins and saw that others that had been There for 25+mins hadn't even paid for much less gotten their food... Would have just done as much good to have shut the doors and locked as opposed to being open..,0
"Found the drive through staff to be rude on a regular basis over the course of several visits. If you can go a few miles down the road, the Sand Lake location on I-drive is much better.",0
"This Mc Donald's it's always really slow. Simple orders like a Quarter Pound and Mc Nuggets can take forever. I'm already waiting 40 minutes on Curbside Pickup and nothing. It already happened sometimes, I will not come back to this Mc Donald's anymore. Terrible customer service.",0
Sat in the drive thru for 30 minutes before being able to order. Part of the delay was due to another car deciding thier time was more valuable by cutting the line so it pushed three other cars besides mine back in line. Two other cars followed suit so we couldn't even leave when we wanted to and were forced to stay and order because we along with the traffic trying to leave the parking lot was blocked in. When I called to complain while forced to stay in line I was on hold for 6 minutes before hanging up because the manager didnt want to answer my call,0
"Unbelievably poor service. Ordered 3 items. 2 bagged immediately but then waited 15 mins for final item - a double cheeseburger. By this time first 2 items cold so asked for a fresh re order.  30 mins later! Walked out with barely an apology. Given the numerous bad reviews for this outlet you would expect a change in personnel. Avoid if you can, don't expect if you cannot.",0
"Normally visit this location 4 out of 7 days a week usually early mornings and staff dont seem to want to be there which is ok because it is early 530am. On 4/21/19 the frappe machine is down for cleaning at 5am, and now on 4/22/19 the system is completely down. It's becoming a place that isn't dependable.",0
Just went through the drive thru and literally was in line for about 20 mins start to finish. For being a fast food they are super slow. They are in the heart of Orland and do not do a good job. My French fries were cold. One of my kids drink was empty and the cookies I ordered were completely wrong. I would suggest going to q near by restaurant which they have faster service than these people.,0
"Good luck being served if you have questions about allergies. We asked one of the employees to check the ingredients of the chicken nuggets to make sure there were no dairy allergens. He asked his manager to check. She straight out refused. We couldn't even complete one of our orders.

30 minutes after placing our other order, we received fries so cold, when I went up to the front to get fresh ones, I didn't even have to say anything. One of the employees brought me new ones automatically after the manager ignored my presence.

The bathrooms were nasty, the tables were dirty, every trash can was over flowing, and the whole lobby smelled like rotten fish. This is easily the worst McDonalds in Orlando.",0
The rep did not my order correct after I repeated it to him twice. When I got to the pick up window I told the rep I was missing nuggets and she said I was not charged for it. I told her that I would pay for it and said it was ok. She then gave me a 10 piece nugget instead of 6 I don't know where she got those nuggets from but they were ice cold. I felt so bad because my son bit into them and was so disappointed. Although I was less than a minute away I refused to go back because I felt that was done spitefully.  Usually go to this location at least 4 times but will NEVER return and encourage any one I know to skip this location,0
What a waste of time we were there in line for more than 30 minutes. The woman at the window asked for our receipt and still did not get the order correct. We spent 5 minutes at pick up trying to get it corrected . When I asked for my re eipt back she told me she lost it. When I said I wanted the Manager she slammed the window shut. The manager  said she put the order together from the receipt. He stated the order screen only holds orders for 25 minutes. Not sure what to think McDonalds at this location in the later evening I would suggest do not stop find another.,0
"Horrible service- stood there for 20 minutes trying to pay 6.00 for my food. Manager was talking to one customer ignoring others, workers were in back play fighting. Drive through line was around the building and over 12 customers in line. After 20 minutes, asked if I could pay manager when she finally came by  register- she told me I would have to wait very rudley and walked away. She was very ride to customer in front of me also who had waited longer for his food. Will never go back there and advise others to avoid this mcdonalds.",0
We shouldn't  even be waiting for fast food more than 40 minutes . For order of chicken nuggets. Please . Also they wanted to give us watered down drinks . I mean i know fast food   isn't easy but damn 40 minutes really give me a break. Staff is extreamly slow. Won't  be back.,0
"How hard is it to give us the unsweetened tea we ordered instead of sweet tea. We got on the hwy, took the first sip and realized the ineptitude of the staff. Too late to turn around...",0
"Waited 40 minutes in the drive thru, and then they started turning cars away. Would've loved to go somewhere else, but the options were sparse at 1 AM. Got up to the window and the manager literally didnt even care about the horrible service.",0
Horrible food.....bag the  chicken sandwich came in had a disgusting almost like a gasoline smell.....and the sandwich was not warm at all....and the sandwich tasted like it had been sitting around for a very good amount of time....I threw it away immediately and spit out the bite I had in my mouth....disgusting... disappointing...and I stopped visiting the McDonald's on hwy 29 Cantonment because of bad food and sloppy service...and this one on pine forest rd Pensacola..will be on my McDonald's never to visit too......,0
"Waited in line for 30+ mins to get to order and they said that everything was broken and were taking cash only. Nice. I wasn't even mad, just disappointed.",0
"You wouldn't expect it but it's not as good as it is in europe, not to mention if you'll go there really hungry by the time they'll serve you you'll starve.",0
"If I could give this less than 1 star I absolutely would! I spent 30 minutes in line just to get 2 meals and 2 ice creams for my kids. Waited 15 minutes just to pay and another 15+ to get our food. Will NEVER recommend this location to anyone. The sad part, I didn't have high expectations because it was late on a Saturday night and all of the theme parks were letting out and even my low expectations were shattered.",0
"Warning avoid this location at all costs.Truly one of the worst McDonald's in the nation. There's always an issue in the drive-through there's always an issue when you go inside the store. The staff is not friendly not greeting when you walk in the door they have no idea what the 3' ruled is. Whoever their trainer is should be ashame when they have the McDonald's conference in Orlando Florida. If I could give them negative stars I would. When you go through the drive-through there is not a proper greeting. It as is if you are bothering the attendant taking your order. There is no quality service. It's all about quantity, instead of quality.",0
"Employees I dealt with were rude. When they got our order wrong they tried to blame it on us not ordering right. We showed them the receipt and still refused to admit they were wrong. The girl went to the back and came back with the right order, didn't say anything or make eye contact, just handed me the bag. This is the rudest I have ever been treated at any establishment, fast food or not. I recommend everyone drive a little farther up the road to the next McDonald's than deal with what I had to deal with.",0
"Absolutely one of the worst experiences ever at McDonald's. Ordered a ice coffee and cappuccino at 10:13 pm..waited and waited..drive through backed up, 20-30 people inside waiting, absolute chaos. Finally at 10:47pm the lady asked what I ordered and made them so I could leave. Literally 35 minutes for coffee. Horrible experience, short staffed and totally out of control.",0
"I usually frequent McDonald's at least once a week, whether its to grab a coffee or get some pancakes for my little one. This visit was probably the worst I've experienced. I ordered my food at 9:11AM - A mcgriddle, a coffee, and two hashbrowns. Once I paid I was immediately told to go to #1, so I did. After waiting until 9:30AM with no one in the drive thru line anymore I went back around where a female with red hair came walking out with a guy who looked like they knew each other. After handing me my bag, I asked about my drink and she said ""What drink"", I said the coffee that's listed on the ticket you provided me along with the receipt. She said okay and then CONTINUED to hold a conversation with the guy standing right in front of me. I waited an additional 2 minutes and she was still talking and laughing with the guy while me, a customer was watching her and patiently waiting for my coffee. Needless to say, my patience went thin and I told her to forget about it and I had to leave. I paid for something I never received and was treated with the most disrespect in my book. Coming from a long time McDonalds customer, I wont be back again.",0
Wish I could give a ZERO... food was horrible and the whole order was wrong.. paid extra for cheese no cheese no mayonnaise on anything. Food was cold and to top it off the dime size tomatoes on each sandwich 7 sandwiches and 2 were right.. cant post the pictures on here or I would.. service unacceptable,0
"There was one car in front of me when I pulled up at 5am. More than 20 minutes for a single egg mcmuffin. I was given no explanation or apology for the wait either. I'm honestly appalled at the poor service, especially at such a nice location. I will literally never come here ever again.",0
"Don't know why, but ever since the rebuild of this site, the burgers are unbearable. Never juicy, dry and unfavorable as can be... From the little burgers to the quarter pounder, it's the same. Doesn't even taste like meat anymore. They had the same problem with the nuggets at first but that got better after a few months, but we'll over a year now, and the burgers are just like eating flavored cardboard. What happened?",0
Ordered a spicy chicken sandwich....bit  into the sandwich and it was a bit hard to chew the sandwich was undercooked.... not happy with this at all.,0
It was awful!!!! 45 min to get lunch! Lines of people complaining.  No ice in the soda machine.  Told them we wanted are money  back ! They found are food,0
Spent over 30 minutes waiting in line at the drive thru at around 9 pm. Finally placed my order of 2 egg mcmuffins. Recieved 2 egg mcmuffins that must of been sitting since the morning hours from breakfast. The white portion of the egg was almost black. They are supposed to make them fresh after breakfast hours not serve on from 12 hours prior.,0
"Horrible service... waited over 40 min for my cold food! No one wanted to speak up but i did, manager turns around and tells me we are short staffed but no excuse for them dragging their feet and cracking jokes to each other...total opposite of a FAST food joint. I would of had better luck and service an actual sit down place..",0
Store is unprofessional not open during business hours. When does that happen at mcdonalds. Not a good look.,0
HORRIBLE! It took 54 mins to get our food and then it was nasty. We watched the manager mix sweet and unsweet to fill a mans tea. Noone ever asked for our order so we pulled forward at the window. Will NEVER stop at this location on our way home from Seaworld. EVER!,0
"Our order was messed two days in a row when visiting this McD on vacation.

The first day they rang up our at the drive thru incorrectly AND didn even match the incorrectly charged order. Second day we ordered at the kiosk inside and they didn give us 2 of the items we ordered (an apple pie and hashbrown).

Not sure if there",0
"WORST MCDONALD'S EVER!!!! unfortunately I cannot leave less then 1 star. They have 10 automatic screens to place your order from, but only if you want breakfast, cant order lunch from them. A completely waste of my time and money! Your better off going across the street to Burger King and getting a whopper!!!!",0
Wrong order through the drive thru. Doesnt surprise me any more with this location. Glad I'm not allergic to the items I requested to be removed.,0
"The ONLY reason I gave this place one star is because I couldn't give it ZERO!
we ordered on a kiosk at McDonald's because the counter line was too long.  Come to find out it's because the kiosks weren't taking payment?  I then proceeded to wait in line FOR AN HOUR to just PAY for my food.  When I asked for a refund for my friend's food the manager pointed at food that had been sitting there no less than 10 mins and said ""it's coming.""  Uh, no!  Needless to say we got our refund and ended up going across the street to iHOP instead.  Shout out to the waiter at iHOP and the whole staff for doing so much better than McDonald's!",0
"Employees just hate being there. Not one person said thank you, please you are welcome. Just What's Your Order, Pull around, here. Put people who actually want to work and a friendly. Its not that hard!",0
Horrible customer service tried to order at the register and the manager talked to me like I was a child and had to order at the kiosk. Mean while half the kiosk in the building was not working.,0
One of my worst experiences at a McDonalds ever.   I waited in a line at the drive through for 20  minutes.  Get to the first window where I hand them my card and end up paying for someone else's order.   Waited longer to correct that situation.  The order at the window was wrong.  Waited some more for that to be corrected.  Finally the lid to my soda wasn't on so when I went to grab it in the car the lid popped off the cup and spilled all over me.,0
"It took 26 minutes for them to make 5 double cheeseburgers. I asked the manager Daniel why, he said they just completed a large online order. I told him this was the 2nd time in a month I had to wait an outrageous time for fast food and he just starred at me blankly. Eventually Daniel told me I was holding him up and making other people wait. I thought that was pretty rude and unconstructive for a manager to say. Terrible location, regardless of how busy it is, it almost always looks like a warzone inside with trash everywhere and nasty, dirty tables, and the wait time for food can be really ridiculous and on top of all that the staff is rude.",0
"Seriously you have one job? Ordered a stake egg and cheese on a bagel they served it on a biscuit. Ordered a egg McMuffin, served a Sausage egg McMuffin?? Best part about it. A MANAGER walked it out to my car. Y",0
I went through the drive-thru the drive-thru was closed so I came in the kiosk was not working right and the lady would not take my order so I left,0
Worst experience been waiting in the dining room with it full during COVID  for the last 20 mins with no help from manager two employees just sitting on their phone not one person has enknowledge anyone who waiting for their food they haven asked for anyone order number that is waiting or trying to push people food out I have been waiting for 20 mins they walked passed me as I was tryin,0
New and clean but horrible service,0
Super impolite drive thru and cashier. We had to repeat the order three times bc she was talking to someone else and they didn,0
"The manager at this location is Mike. I was the only person in the drive through. Mike opens the window and hands me my food and walks away. I looked him right in the eye and asked for BBQ sauce. This is how little Mike cares about his job and helping his customers.

Pure laziness at this location!!",0
Terrible processed unhealthy food that squarely contributes to the diabetic and obesity epidemic especially with the underprivileged.  Went only as an emergency.,0
"We went here late night after EDC. Around 2am, we waited about an hour to get our food. Whatever its the night of EDC so it was crowded ok. In a 22$ order, we were missing 2 items equaling 8$ and a sweet and sour sauce that they charged me 2$ for. After going back and telling them what happened, they argued. I eventually got the egg sandwich and double bacon cheeseburger, which ended up having no bacon. Still never got that 2$ sweet and sour.",0
"at Night, they didn't give happy meal drink. they have a sign for if they don't  offer new dessert, they will give a free dessert. But they never mention about it. So, I requested them to give a free dessert. They don't want to give a free dessert..",0
"By far the rudest customer service I have ever encountered. I went around 3:32am on Sunday went to the drive through my husband asked what comes with the crispy tenders meal she responded so rudely ""ugh fries and a drink what else"" he laugh and asked if she had a long shift cause that was really sarcastic and again she responded rudely "" cause who doesn't know that"".  I don't work at McDonald why should I know what comes with a meal every place is different regardless it's no excuse to be rude to a customer.",0
No napkins inside and the buns on the sandwiches we ordered were on hard buns....the sandwich and nuggets we ordered tasted like they were made a few hours ago.....I don't think I'll be coming again,0
Hire more staffing during evening hours. Waited about 25 min with only about 4 cars ahead of me before finally giving up. Be more proactive and tell customers if there will be a long wait.,0
Order from the kiosks cause all the POS were unmanned and closed. Paying by cash made this a pain but not only that as everyone else was ordering and having thier order number shouted across the restaurant we waited and waited until after 30 mins got uo to ask how our order wasnt called or even on the board we were told we had to queue to replace the order and pay. Utter farce after being here multiple times and having no problems this was a shambles and insulting,0
They were out of chicken and ice cream. Waited 40 minutes on the drive thru to get our food. Cash only. Their credit card system was down.,0
had me waiting a whole hour on doordash just to cancel my order horrible service do better or try,0
We are British but never had the same problem on our many visits to Florida. He persons taking our order just didn't understand what we were asking for. Very frustrating seeing as our language is almost identical,0
We ordered on the online tablet and we sat down and waited for 15 minutes and got tired of waiting so we went to the front and was told that our food was given to us ten minutes ago and it wasn't clearly. They remade the order and of course it was incorrect so I had to go and get them to fix it again.,0
No inside seating. Rude employees that barely noticed I was there. No napkins in my bag and no one asked or seemed to care if I needed any. I had to remind them my meal came with a drink.,0
"Very poor. 22 minutes of waiting on my order to be wrong and it was sitting on the back counter the whole time. Didn't say anything because I knew I hadn't ordered what was on the tray. Employees only wanted to do one thing and passing the buck to someone else. The kiosks don't work properly. The line to get your money is quick enough but the wait is ridiculous. Only 6 words of English amongst the whole crew. ""Thand you"" ""I sorry"" ""Come again"". Wel here are 2 more for you, Never Again!",0
"Often very slow bc of the flood of people. Thirty minute wait for fast food is crazy. If you use the mobile app, stick to drive thru. I waited 30 minutes for curbside pick up and 25 minutes in lobby. I recommend getting back in your car and going to Chick-fil-A. You퐇l be there and back with your food before anything hap",0
"No card acepted
Have men",0
"This has to be the WORST experience ever at a fast food place. We used the kiosk and were thrilled because we placed the order faster than the workers that were ignoring us at the counter. THEN they only brought 1/4 of our order. Forgot our 4 McCafe drinks and condiments. Then when one of the teenagers told someone at the counter, he was told to ask someone else. Really? You want $15/hr for this? I had low expectations because no McDonalds gets the order right but damn.",0
"Make me wait over 25 min and still get my order wrong, if you want to get upset go to this drive through!",0
Super slow to get food.  It appears drive thru got all the attention.  15 minutes to get food is too long.  Also when I order a breakfast meal with a soda I want the choice to get a larger drink when they are all the same price,0
I would rate it a 1 star but people would not take my review seriously. I visited this restaurant last night. It was very clean including the bathroom. At this time there was one cashier with a huge line and a bunch of people waiting for their order. The cashier was overloaded and the manager told everyone to order at the kiosks and not the register. This wasn't possible because nobody could pay at the kiosk; they had to get a receipt and pay at the register. I left 20 minutes later and went to Wendy's when the line had barely moved.,0
Terrible. Sign says 24hrs. Door says till 3am. Was denied service at 10:30pm. Attitude was horrible.,0
I퐒e had one really positive experience at this McDonald and one really negative. First time they were super fa,0
"Rude and drinks and food was wrong.  Asked for sauce for nuggets, handed 2 of them and window closed on us and the drive thru person walked away",0
"So disappointing.Place is terrible.The food is even worse.Took the family and ordered.Food was cold,hamburger rolls were hard and fries were cold.I will not be coming back to this location.",0
Avoid drive thru like the plaque.  2nd night queueing for over 40 mins.,0
"If I could give this place a 0 star rating, I would. I work late and sometimes don feel like cooking when I get home, so I stop at this McDonald occasionally. But, 99% of the time they only take CASH! Which I퐒e never heard of in my entire life. Tonight at 12:25 am on 05/27 I was getting off of work, hungry. So, stopped at this awful place. WAITED for over 20 minutes in drive thru to just be tol",0
"We had to wait about an hour to get our food that we already paid at one of those""self order screens"", it was supposed to be faster but it was a waste of time. Fast food? What a shame guys, you can do better!",0
"New system of ordering at kiosks is aweful. Despite the most important thing to me being wanting to order with a human being, ordering at the kiosk took longer and was more difficult than ordering with a human...and I wanted to pay cash which required I go to a cashier after ordering at the kiosk, very frustrating. Also, the new fountain drink machines are equally aweful, I will never order a drink from a machine that dispenses all drinks from one spout because no matter what you dispense it always tastes like a mix of more than one drink. Why has McDonalds chosen to fix what wasn't broken and use systems and machines which customers so clearly dislike?",0
"Sorry, coffee was horrible, 3 of us threw it away. Pancakes were rock hard. I cannot find the 1 I visited the other day. They had the McMuffin 2 for $3.50. Excellent service and food was good",0
"Not Brother bringing food food to table,long wait and don",0
Hi-Tech = SLOOOOWWW 20 minutes into waiting for a 1 person order as the employee screams out order numbers without the table number locator.  Slowest McD ever and shouting employees because of a bad system.  Not 1 person whiping the soiled floor or tables. Pretty bad,0
"bad service, they don't respect the time indicated on the sign, mc Donald's disrespect for the customer, constantly decay",0
"Horrible service!!! Whoever that moronic lady working the counter register at 11:50 pm on August 15th, 2018 is, she should be shoved into a corner of the rear of the store indefinitely!!! The fact that she couldn grasp the English language isn even the worst of if. On top of that, she had an attitude and acted like her doing her job was an inconvenience! I get it, it",0
"No hand sanitizer. Biscuit was dry and hard. Staff wanted me to take a number to place on table, but I refused. No telling how many millions of ppl held that thing. The germs. Ugh!",0
"It was really bad, the chicken wasn't good, didn't salt fries, forgot the sauce, and when I ask for it, he gave it to the person next to me!",0
"Terrible service, I order a few things and had to wait over 20 minutes in order to receive my items. No one approached me and another guy when we were standing at the cashier for over 10 minutes. Not even the managers. I had to ask one of the employees if they actually had a cashier.",0
"Worst McDonald's experience  ever.  Silent 25 mins in drive thru.  When ordering we were advised could not sub drink in meal with McFlurry and had to purchase separately.  When finally making to window to pay, they couldn't 'find' my order.  For this to be in a Prime location in Orlando,  they completely failed the meaning of fast food.",0
"Never had such a terrible experience at a restaurant which is a big deal for me to say since my 3 year old is allergic to many things.  This morning around 12:28 am 11/24/18 when asked the very standard "" may I see the food allergy menu"" or since that wasn't available, ""would you mind checking the ingredients on the package while I wait to place my order while others go ahead"" the cashier was told by the manager right in front of me that she would not get the menu nor would she check the ingredients and went right back to laughing and carrying on with another employee.  The same manager stood around looking at others needing help during the rush without any movement or intention to step in for her team or their long waiting customers.  The entire place was in disarray from the back to the front with filthy tables, floors, and bathrooms.  Every trash can in the place was overflowing and the pungent smells both in the lobby and the restrooms were enough to make anyone lose their appetite.  Black Friday or not... absolutely unacceptable brazen behavior from management that I would never tolerate under any circumstance from my own team at any level of the company.  Zero stars...would not recommend.",0
Stopped in to get breakfast and there was mold on my bagel and the oil must haven't been changed in a while because the hash browns tasted like old oil instead of hash browns. Never will stop there again.,0
"Bathroom it was a disgraceful experience. Lobby tables dirty. Drinking fountain super dirty. Hamburger box came oily. Unfortunately, it was NOT a great experience and cleaning McDonald's. Better to give up on McDonald's for once and for ALL. You can base a restaurant by their bathrooms.",0
I ordered 20pc. Nuggets received 10pc. Nuggets(BAD IN ORDERS). I ordered pasta and what I got was more sauce than actual pasta. I had to ask for my cups because they they give it to me. I recommend to not come here if you dont want to stress out. BAD SERVICE.,0
"The employee's are nice, location is always dirty. Tables have to be clean more often. The food quality has gotten better.",0
"This McDonald's location used to be great. Since their renovation it's been just a disaster. Customer service is non existent, managers and staff are all in the kitchen pushing food out. No one at the front to help, just disgraceful...",0
"This place deserves no stars. My order, which was just a sandwich, was messed up three times and it still wasn't right. The staff was lazy and unhelpful. There was trash on the tables and filthy floors. Definitely no smiles served at this establishment!",0
Picked the wrong lane and did not get asked for my order as 3 cars passes by in the other order lane. I pulled up and the manager told me I had to pay inside. It took 30 minutes to order and get my food. Horrible.,0
"Ok, so everytime me and my family come to this place is a disaster because we have to wait a lot on the drive thru, I mean a lot of time waiting and they usually have us the wrong order. The service is not that good either, they have a rude attitude.",0
Order is wrong everytime i have went or missing items!,0
This was the worst experience I have ever had! It took 20 minutes to get our order and another 20 minutes to get our correct order.,0
"They ignore me at drive in and they serve 5 cars that came after
Finally when shes5 answer I ask nice why she didn't serve me and she ignore me again
Never ever recommend 0 Zero review for this place",0
"Plug ins dont work also took 20mins to order, the cashier was just standing in the back. Asked about the plugs in, she told us that it's not their problem. Horrible service",0
"This McDonald needs work. By far the worst, and most over cooked food I퐒e ever had. Just bought a cheeseburger and it tastes and looks like it was reheated in the microwave. The worke",0
"Slow service. They even work with one hand . If we didn't asked for our food after waiting 40 mins , it was just going to be sitting in the kitchen. The place was packed and the service was slow.",0
Didn't even get to eat line never moved and I left after waiting 20 min,0
This is not the worlds biggest McDonald,0
Awful employees they all talk way to much to one another instead of getting their jobs done. None of them work together to accomplish any work task and who ever works the front ordering station is not well at their job,0
"Two days in a row while attending a convention nearby I stopped for a quick breakfast. They don't listen .... they don't care ... and they DON'T GET IT RIGHT.

I've repeated my request for something simple so many times in one day they should be paying me for the teaching experience. Product and service have sucked both days.

IHOP is acrossl the street. They listen. They get it right.",0
Really poor level of service. Waited over 20 mins for a quarter pounder :-(,0
"Ordered the Quarter pounders deluxe with cheese no pickle and one with no onion.
They both had no lettuce and tomato on them. I call them about it and they were glad to replace them. I go back and 10mims later we get hot fries and two sandwiches but both had onions and pickles on them..
#nevergetitright #McDonalds",0
"I want to give this place 0 stars - the self ordering system is inefficient and way more confusing than it has to be, and staff is unprepared. Not their fault. They need training but as is right now it's awful. Took us an hour and a half to get two meals. Ridiculous.",0
extremely busy/highly understaffed. waited 1 hr in drive thru (last resort) for my food. this is not fast food.,0
"Curbside doesn't exist. It's just a waste of time as you still have to go in and  when you try to go in, the doors are locked.. Most ridiculous experience ever!",0
Ordered quarter pounder on 2 different nights and both times burger was still raw in the middle. Totally unacceptable for place that sells food. Stay away unless you want E. Coli poisoning.,0
Employees just talk amongst themselves not fulfilling orders or payments as we sit in the driveways like dummies waiting for a bag of cold food. Thanks guys...all 3 times (different days and times),0
Past 2 recent visits my order has been incorrect and required remakes.  They have a lot of employees and all are doing their own thing.  Not an example of fast food.,0
It has been 20+ min and im still sitting here as I am writing this waiting for my food. And the employees seem too busy to acknowledge your presence half the time when you are trying to speak to them.,0
"For a prime, busy, tourist filled location, the processes and procedures at this McDonalds are absolutely terrible.  Many of the self-ordering machines do not work, when you use a normal line with a cashier, it's like the employees have never even been to a McDonald's before as they don't even know the menu items (I ordered traditional chicken nuggets meal, so it wasn't pasta, or some sandwich that only special locations have).  When you order at a kiosk, you can order things they do not have such as a waffle cone ice cream.  Then you wait 15+ minutes to find out they don't have waffle cones and wait for an employee to make a fresh one, which she doesn't know how to do so you end up paying $4+ for a cup of ice cream.  I did get my money back for the ice cream because I couldn't believe it took that long.  Don't bother going here; it's not worth it, unless you want to feel like you're waiting at Disney at a subpar place.",0
Can't even take an order correctly! Couldn't repeat the order back or even put it on the screen for us to review.,0
"Waiting for someone to take my order.. 5 minutes later told to use the screen.. no thanks.. I don't work for mcdonalds.. Im the one with the money making the purchase.. I appreciate the option of the screen should there be a long line, but for me to fiddle through all that garbage because no one can take the order.. no thanks.. there are far too many other options out there.. bye mcdonalds., no loss..",0
"Very slow service, took over 10 minutes to get two coffee's and cakes despite there being hardly any customers. Also restroom's were dirty.",0
Waited 20 min for a qtr pounder at 3am only to witness a worker scrape the onions off my burger with her bare hands I asked for a new burger she argued that I didn't see her do this  absolutely unacceptable,0
My fries where overcooked hard and greasy and the manager who brought our food to us spilled my drink on me never compensated I will not be returning. By far the worst McDonald's I ever been to ...your team is only as good as your team leader and this place has a very bad team leader,0
You can not get service at the front counter. They only cater to drive thru and kiosk. Past 2 weeks have stopped and after 10 mins no one would take order after having 3mgr look at you,0
Pretty cool but didn drive a 4 hour drive to for the cashier to catch a attitude wi,0
Extremely slow! Gave a free drink but didn,0
This place is really clean but the service was awlful my food was cold n they don't HV a dollar menu ,0
"Very over priced, but did bump into my nan so we did have a good catch up about Corrie, but there is a much better place near, BURGER KING. The straws are thicker and the drinks are cooler. I would of gave macdonalds 3 stars but the old women in front of me how took 2 mins and 47 seconds to decide. Yes I counted. Drew the final straw.",0
"Used the drive thru. Ordered three large fries. Paid for three large fries. Received only two large fries, and no receipt was given to me, so I couldn't go in and prove that I ordered three.",0
The service and food was terrible. It took so long to get it that I didn't want to wait in line another 20 minutes. Manager didn't care about us.,0
"Cold food, expensive to take advantage of the tourists and poor service",0
"Waited 25 minutes in the drive thru with 7 cars in line. Not busy, just poorly managed.",0
It took over an hour to go Thur the drive thru and the order was wrong,0
Manager is a complete joke with zero customer service service skills. Place is dirty inside and out.,0
Wait for my order over 10 minutes drive thru#2 Deluxe with extra onions. Fries where soggy. Had to go back inside to get fresh fries. Looked under staffed,0
Took forever and drive through was down. Took over 30 mins to get food after they said the drive through was down and we went inside. Terrible service.,0
The dining room said open until 3:30am and it was closed by 10:30pm.,0
Worst service I've ever had waited over 45 minutes in the drive thru for a 10 peice nugget meal..... workers didn't seem to know what there job was!!! Manager looked lost by what it appeared from the window.,0
The service was awful and rude. They messed up my order when trying to get it fixed the manager had and attitude even though I had my receipt to show I wasnt lieing.,0
"Staff were swearing on the tills, wandering around in non uniform and using their phones. The girl on the till in the ferrari jumper was flat out ignoring me as I tried to order as she was busy sending Whatapps to friends and the few people who seem to actually care and work hard are stressed as they work with slackers.",0
Had to constantly repeat myself. The manager had asked me to use the kiosk for a custom order when I didn't want to make a custom order.,0
Repeated my order 8 times. They still got it wrong. Called back and was hung up on when I asked for my money back. Called again... same result. Called a total of 3 times and each call was hung up on.,0
"Just plain horrible , 30 minutes sitting in drive thru, taking orders one car at a time",0
"Only two power outlets in the whole place and the best one is at the ""employee's"" table. Noisy and confused environment. Not for business people. Has a 60 minute time limit on  Internet.",0
"They say they are closed during open hours quite regularly.   Why bother keep the lights on!  I live close by and work late.  I have given up,  crazy.",0
"Quite literally one of the worst McDonald's ever! Staff is incompetent, unfriendly, and doesn't get the order right or the food is OLD. As the manager of a 1500 room resort, I advise all of my guests to detour this location.",0
Slowest MCDS IN THE ENTIRE STATE OF FLORIDA!!! Stay away unless you want to waste time in the drive-thur,0
No one had on hairnets. We get our food and wasn asked if we needed anything,0
"Horrible service, staff was very rude and we waited over 20 minutes for our order. When we asked why it was taking so long the lady said ""well you can wait for the food or you can just leave now""",0
Horrible!!! We waited 1 hour in line to get mediocre food. We were told they were understaffed,0
This is the WORST McDonald ever!! I wouldn even give them 1 star if I didn,0
This location is NOT open 24 hours! Please adjust your google advertisement!,0
"Went there today and went through the drive thru and the girl taking my order was very rude, so I told her get the manager  and she was rude as well. Poor ass customer service if you ask me the don't even deserve my one star.",0
Raise all their prices due to the Convention center. Some sandwiches raised by $3. As a company this large they should be able to keep the prices lowered rather than ripping off all the people in the area.,0
Bought a happy meal the other day and they decided for me that I didn w,0
"Nasty tables, wiped our table with a paper towel and no soap or sanitizer! No soap or sanitizer in bathroom.",0
You have to order at kiosk. Several people were frustrated.  Took about 15 minutes to get our order,0
I ordered hot chocolate and they gave me hot milk.... I also order an ice coffee which was also completely milk. they weren,0
"A great franchise that has gone terribly wrong. Service was bad, order was wrong, and it's suppose to be fast food, not was in line for 21 minutes",0
Beautiful establishment both inside and out but the soda dispensers weren't working and waiting in line to get drinks and ketchup sucks when other customers are placing orders and facing the same dilemma...,0
Terrible service!!!! Waited at the drive up speaker for minutes before anyone asked for my order.  Then proceeded to wait in the line for over 10 mins.  If someone has food that is taking longer you should pull them up!!,0
"The nuggets from this location were the WORST I've ever had! Unfortunately I didn't taste them until I'd gotten back to my room, otherwise I'd definitely have asked for my money back.",0
"Worst service ever. They didnt have everything in my order and then look at me like I did something wrong. Actually, wouldnt even look at me. I will never come.here again.",0
"Took 15 mins to pick up my mobile order. 3 ppl working there and nobody knows where my order was. When I got it, it's already cold.",0
Sloooooow service! 1:00 PM and just got a cheeseburger & small fries from drive-thru because I was late for a meeting. Took 15 minutes for this simple order!! Really...for a burger & fries?,0
I am so tired of these franchises ripping off customers and upscaling the prices on items that are supposed to be a dollar! McDonald's just needs to take down this $1 $2 $3 deal. It seems as if every McDonald's I go into now is ran by either Hoodrats or Morons that are unable to perform their job duties.,0
"Not very good customer service at all except for the manager, more training needed to deal with people",0
"Worst experience. Drive thru line was longggg. I left the line and came back again at 12.15am, by then it was closed. 24 hours???",0
"Costumer service is terrible, approached register to order was told they were to busy i had to use the self service computer, talked to a lady ""looked"" like a manager she asked the casheir to take my order but then i heard how she told her to keep sending people to the computer! Managers are rude and not well dressed",0
"I work around this area and have stopped here a handful of times, every time I've waited at least 10-15mins and cashier's are rude. I will go out of my way to not stop here again",0
Waited at the register with one person in front of me for about 20 minutes without one employee even acknowledging our presence.  I left and went to Dennys,0
I퐒e been to McDonald,0
These kiosks messed up my order. I퐒e been waiting 40 minutes for chicken n,0
"Service is slower than molasses in January. Also, the order stations did not print a receipt and when I went to claim my food, they wouldn",0
"Mario - glasses, dark hair. What an irresponsible manager. Left everything to manager Stephanie whilst he disregarded customers. Food missing from orders, another customer (young teenager ) spoken to like dirt by a female member of staff.
I tried to complain about Mario who did not respond appropriately (couldn't be bothered to make any verbal response) but had to wait forever for Stephanie as she was putting out fires all over the restaurant. You could not pay me to work with Mario or the newly appointed manager who was called to speak with me  but never came over despite eye contact and him making a grumpy sound(young, black guy who was more into showing off in front of the young female staff than treating any woman with respect).
What ever the main manager, Stephanie is being paid isn't enough. I saw her run, rule, command the show in a way that got the job done. She was gracious with all customers whilst her staff were ignorant gits.",0
"Waited 45 minutes for 2 drink cups, and then the ice machine was broken.",0
"Got nuggets and fries. Asked for barbeque and ketchup for the fries. Got no barbeque or ketchup, good thing we went to the big mcdonalds, enjoying dry nuggets now. At least the food was hot.",0
Will not make it with current management,0
45minute wait for food and a rubber over cooked chicken burger...very inconsistent with McDonalds standards,0
$5 for a 10 count of nuggets...?  Fries tasted like metal.  Change out the oil! Ugh!,0
Kept trying to give me the wrong items did not speak very good English. Food was hot though when finally got right stuff.,0
Took an hour and a half to get food but friendly staff.,0
"Epic McDonald's on International dr. Is lacking customer service.  Had the coupon for free Happy Meal from Visit Florida.  They didn't want to give it to us because we downloaded from site and printed not from tourist booklet.  Then said it was not actually for a happy meal.  Just drink, fries, and burger/nuggets. "" No box, toy, yoghurt or toy""  even though the coupon stated ""HAPPY MEAL""  no small print.  Girl at drive thru wasn't nice.  Prices at epic McDonald's are quite a bit higher than the other locations and no $1,2,3 menu",0
In almost all McDonald's I have been going have self order post. The bad news is when the machine freezes up you have to go at front and ask for help right? No help you need to l look ace the order again.,0
Fries were very cold children's burgers were creased as if once wrapped they were smashed with something service wasn't terrible but food put out was.,0
"Slow service and attendents don't acknowledge customers....I ate there multiple times since it was close to where I was saying and could get a quick bite to eat, but it was slow",0
"Terrible experience. Came this morning at 4:28am, no egg whites, no scrambled eggs for big breakfast. Long story short.. waited almost 25 minutes to get the order. Unacceptable",0
"Wait time of over 30min, and then they had the order completely wrong after repeating the entire order again at the pay window. Not fun after a long day of travel and you are just looking for the normalcy of a dang McDs!!",0
Pathetic. we placed 4 orders. all 4 were incorrect. not busy and utter chaos. ONE PLACE TO AVOID. .   needs a good manager to control things.,0
I waited 58 minutes to get my order SMHFSTS they need help.,0
"It literally took my boyfriend an hour and 13 minutes to receive our food. (two meals)
I get it,  things happen and it's one thing to be understaffed, but maybe corporate needs to step in to save this location.
We won't be back",0
Worst drive thru times. Waited like 20mins to get my order. This is not the first time either. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and it happen again tonight.,0
"associates would not help me,  they expect everyone knows hows to use the ordering kiosks.  then after ordering , associate did not know how to count change back to me, I had to do it for her.",0
Went here in a lyft on my way to hotel from airport. they were out of ice cream and fries.,0
They can't handle a lot of customer. Waited 10 minutes for my order outside,0
"So, they can ring you up at the counter but you have to order through those machines? Ugh. Place smells like disinfectant and bleach, charges tourist prices.",0
Great place to go and have you're entire order screwed up. Then have them tell you there's no milkshakes after you pay for one meanwhile they give the lady beside you one,0
Fries were cold and burger seemed very old. And we ordered at 1am you think the food would of been fresh,0
"Fine in the morning, go at night and the staff were terrible,  rude, unhelpful, lots of food not available,  I really thought the lady serving us was on some sort of go slow medication,  if we hadn't already paid for the food and the kids were moaning that were hungry, the server would have been wearing the food!!!!",0
The worst McDonald and cust,0
"Wait time for food ridiculous.
15mins to make a qtr pounder no cheese meal.",0
THE SLOWEST AND TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Definitely not coming back!,0
"Slooooooooowest McDonald's I've ever been to.  Seriously we waited in the drivethru for probably 10 minutes for a happy meal and some chicken nuggets- and, no, they were not fresh as they were old and cool to touch.",0
Service was very slow. Managers did not work with urgency to get orders out on time while people waited 20 minutes for their orders,0
Soon they will just use 3D printers to make what they call food. It can't be cheese they use and nothing fresh ever. I would pass and feed your kids anything else .,0
Horrible place didn,0
"Was under staffed, long wait, order was gotten wrong",0
It's 11:55 p.m. and it says that this place is open 24 hours & ITS NOT OPEN!! PLEASE UPDATE YOUR HOURS ONLINE,0
I went to use the bathroom while I was there and it was utterly nasty. What else would you expect from McDonald's,0
"All self ordering machines... food took forever to come out, drink machine didn't work",0
"Order was wrong, fries were stale and cold, typical mcdonalds service",0
No vegeterian options,0
Manager stops doing uber eats after 4am so he wasted my time and gas that I wont be getting back. Don't do eats here you'll be disappointed,0
The line was extremely long and the menu was extremely limited. How could they not have coffee...,0
Horrible service with the new order menu's. Even the employee does know how to use it. Takes too long and is very confusing,0
"Came for dine in service apparently last one of the night since I got locked in, food was you know McDonald's, the terrible management is quite apparent at this place, if there is another option do not come here",0
This has to be the slowest place ever they never have half of what is on the menu and they are rude,0
"Visited with the kids we decided to go on mc drive, after we got on our turn after 5min of waiting nobody answered and we left to check what is happening as inside was some kind of restauration, full of staff doing nothing we left.",0
"Terrible customer services ,food is not good at all, I ordered a ice mocha latte they gave to me black coffee.... I was waiting 25 minutes for my food.",0
"Sucked, biscuits were old and hard, not going back",0
Worst ever.   At drive through waiting for sandwiches and they moved us to next window.   Meanwhile five cars behind us have meals,0
They need more staff members. they prioritize the drive thru customera and ignore the walking,0
one of the worst McDonald's I have ever been to. bun was so stale I am surprised I didn't break a tooth.,0
"Food was bad, service was bad. It was a complete cluster",0
Literally just waited 15 minutes at the drive thru and no one came on to ask for my order. I was the third person leave without someone taking their order.,0
"Worst experience at a McDonalds ever. Manager didn't even bother to acknowledge my order was wrong. To be the ""biggest McDonald's in the world"" it sure lacks decent customer service.",0
"Waitied in line for 15 minutes and then when we got to the speaker for them to take our order, no one took our order but the other speaker they look 5 people's orders.",0
Adopting the kiosks eliminated any chance for interaction with a person. The lack of counter and lobby staff makes for a customers helping customers.  Several people gave up on kiosks and left .Expecting robots in the kitchen next time .  The lobby and bathrooms are clean.,0
Service was not good. Drive thru was very busy...,0
Horrible Service Just Horrible ... Long wait and food cold fries taste old .. it was just all bad,0
"They have the slowest people and dumbest people working there . They never get the orders correct , there's always a big fight with the local trash inside the play area with the parents not watching their kids and too busy trying to get a hook up . They need to retrain everyone that works there .",0
"The worst of the worst, they weren't hice, they have a lot of troubles one day not soda, another day they have a lot of customers, in Argentina Mac Donalds are so superior in that situaciones.",0
This is the slowest McDonalds in Florida and after the long wait your food is still wrong,0
Worst experience at this store the employee are sleeping instead serving up will never eat at this place .,0
Prices high and mcgriddle sandwich fit in palm of hand. Not worth money.,0
"Drive-thru and curb side pick up service is so unreliable at this location, which seems to always have long wait times.",0
Staff is horrible. Waiting on an order that had to be placed 3 times now sitting waiting in the line while customers behind me get their food... This place is trash and your employees are worse.,0
"The food was correct and warm, but 30 minutes in the drive through was not expected.",0
"a few days ago i ordered 3 big mac meal, i got charged for an extra drink, i tried to call them but no answer, today went back to get some burgers for my kids and mentioned that i got charged a extra drink, the manager was Rude, she said I need to see the receipt.",0
"Probably the worst customer service of any McDonalds in the Metro Orlando area. Honestly, they should shut it down. Horribly slow and inefficient and they just don't care.",0
By far.... The absolute worst run Mcdonalds I've ever been too... And I travel all over. Staff is rude and could care less about weather or not your food is even slightly warm.... AVOID!!!!!,0
Wanted to shut down and leave over 20 cars in the drive thru and not say a word!!!,0
"Terrible service! Ordered from the kiosk and didn't get food for 30 mins, not even drink cups! When I finally got my food it was cold and missing part of my order! Won't stop here again!",0
They won take anym,0
Stopped in and witnessed an employee use the bathroom and not wash her hands then return to the back. After that we decided to not order food there. Disgusting!,0
Drive through was twenty minutes of no movement. Went inside and no one at the front counter. Typical experience.,0
10/11/2021 12:45am location is closed. Staff member stated location is no longer 24 hours due to no staff.,0
Bad food. Bad service. Very slow. 20+ minutes to get order after paying.,0
What happened to the medium sided cups? Why are they so small?,0
"Terrible service, if they don w",0
Even with me using the screen computer to place my order they still get the order wrong wow really,0
My Nuggets Came Back Covered In Mustard When I Said I wanted mayonais the manaigs they tried giving me was disguting when i ate it and trhen the mustard got on my arm,0
No ice cream machines again. Always broken and right next to many hot theme parks where people want ice cream with lunch.,0
Trash cans outside were over filled and garbage was all over the floor. At least the fries were hot!,0
If u want ice cold fries at midnight even though the store says it open 24,0
", this is the slowest McDs I've been at. Don't think about it if your in a hurry! 15 min to place order & we started at the entry doors.",0
Sucks sucks sucks need more staff it took 45 mins to our food after we paid for it. Its supposed to fast food,0
"Waited 48 minutes in line, and when it was my turn, they said they only take cash. They could have posted a sign somewhere. Awful.",0
Service was horrible took so long order wrong . Dont go,0
"friendly staff, but we waited of 45 minutes for our food, which was mostly cold and had been sitting out the entire time we were there.",0
"Customer service was just poor and uninviting. Didn't really eat since just getting a drink but for a place next to hospitality centric services, I was surprised.",0
This was by far one of the worst McDonald's I've ever been too. It was so loud and the tables were very dirty. The restrooms were very smelly and trashed.,0
"Worst McDonalds ever, they took forever, I stand in front of the counter like 8 minutes waiting for 2 sweet and sour sauce for my kids.",0
Unorganized. Plenty of staff but it still took 30 minutes to get our incomplete order,0
Typical long wait... Missing items... apathetic employees,0
Short of help and check your bag for accuracy.,0
Food is typical for McDonald's. I decided to eat in but alarms were loud and constant the entire time I was there. Several people working and ignoring the various buzzers and chimes. This will keep me from returning.,0
"The  manager is not professional.  If you want to eat in the restaurant you must do it outside in the heat, you cannot eat inside the restaurant",0
Manger was rude. She got an attitude because I didnt want to order off the kiosk. I wouldnt recommend this place especially if you have children.,0
I received half my order. I went back for the other half and still so much wrong!! Then again what can I expect from mcds.,0
Drive thru employee extremely rude and told us we'd need to wait as long as she needed to take,0
They got my order wrong walked away with my debit card my food was cold.  They could not speak English.  Awful location,0
"Bad service, impolite associates. Sprite without taste, no napkins and they said they don't do refill right now! Attend this restaurant soon",0
"Terrible.  Simply put, it's not worth your time to stop at this location.",0
Waited at the table for an egg McMuffin meal for 15 min.  It must be quicker if you order to go.  Sucks,0
For the quality of food that McDonald's has it amazes me the cost of it?,0
Very..very slow.  Nice looking McDonald's but I won't go back to this one.,0
The biggest most unorganized drive thru I've ever been too.,0
Ice cream machine is always down! It makes no sense it's Florida,0
The staff is the slowest I have ever seen and in addition is rude. McDonald's needs to take care of this restaurant!,0
Worst McDonald's I've ever been to. I tripped on the step on my way in and asked for a bandaid and there was no one who could help. Then when I personally asked for the first aid kit and the cashier asked if it was to purchase.... ???,0
...I've been in the drive thru for 15 minutes just for drinks....,0
The store so nasty plus I took so long for the food and the manager was not a good manager she talked back to customers and her store is not clean at all they don't have too many people work in she shouldn't be a manager here she should be fired,0
Lines are long.even kiosk order took over an hour to get food.  Bought credits for games and didn't get card.,0
Waited 20 minutes for food. Unacceptable,0
Please stop frying your fries in beef and do it in vegetable oil like the rest of the world's McDonald's do! The food choice is literally nothing for people who don't eat meat.,0
"Computers were not working, cash only a complete mess. Cashiers do not know how to operate without them.",0
It says 24 hours but they were closed,0
Didn,0
Worst Mcdonalds ever. 20 minute in the drivethru. No cars in front of us.  Not even an apology for the delay. Skip thus Mcdonalds,0
No Hot n' Spicys? Employees are not there to assist customers.,0
"Waited 1/2 hour for only a McFlurry. When it came it was wrong. Suppose to have Rolo's in it, but only had chunks of chocolate. I'll never use this McDonald's again.",0
I hated this. You only could go through  the drive thru. We asked if we could get something and they said no . Then A guy walks up asked for something and They give it to him... wow .. this is utterly ridiculous.,0
Long lines and orders not as asked.,0
"No inside orders,  we walked from our hotel and couldn't order",0
"Super slow, inattentive to what you order ! Extreme wait time",0
It's been about an hour and they are not making any food because the toaster is broken,0
"Not fast food, actually it's slow food.",0
Inconsistent customer service. Nothing really positive to report.,0
My credit card was stolen and used there at 430 in the morning and Manager was not helpful at all. From what I read this happens a lot here.,0
Busiest McDonald's ever.  Plan on 25-30 min to get food.,0

"Nobody is working. Cars lined up in the drive thru, not a soul around. Worst service ever.",0
Self service system simply does not work when main public is foreign people and kids.,0

They were slow and unprepared unfortunately since this location is in a hotel district.,0
"Didn't enjoy this visit. Girl that took my order was rude, as well as management.",0
Terrible 30 minutes in drive thru . Drink was wrong and sandwich was wrong.,0
"I waited for an hour forn2 happy meals, horrible service!",0

"Food made wrong, little Spanish guy manager just stares at me won't even help. Took 15 minutes. If you can't handle food at night don't sell it.",0
Ordered some fries along with some other food and thehe food was old and cold. I would never recommend this mcdonalds.,0
"Service not what it should be. Too slow,  and the quality keeps dropping.",0
"Slow service, cold food, items missing from orders, unfriendly staff, worst Mcdonald experience ever. ",0
They have the horrible touch screens in the lobby. Quiet slow and inefficient.,0
"If I go here daily, they will mess up my easy order 6 times out of 7",0
Takes forever just to get one item,0
40 minute wait just to get a Carmel sundae!,0
"Bad, rude, usless stuff. Maybe not everybody but at least 3 ladies herd when i ask about help but no one helped me...",0
"Service was super slow, food was cold and the burger dry.",0
The worst people they dont even look at you when you talk to them specially manger pm today may 4 730 if she is having a bad day dont take it on others,0
"One of the largest McDonald's in the world, as it is ""GI-NORMOUS"". The food is hit or miss though, especially if you go through the drive-thru.",0
This has to be the worst McDonald's I've been to. They couldn't even give me a hot sandwich,0
"Ordered at the kiosk and the food took over 30 minutes to recieve, terrible service. 1/5",0
Worst mcdonalds ive ever visited. I waited twenty minutes for two sausage cheese biscuits at 7am... TRASH,0
"Fast food is called such because you should get it fast, completely unacceptable to wait almost 30 minutes for BREAKFAST",0
Waited an hour for a 10-count meal. Not even joking. A literal hour. Don't go.,0
Store needs to be shutdown or a change in managers! Waited for an hour to 3 sandwiches without a I,0
"Sux BIG D!!!! drive thru took 45 min for a qtr pnder ... Yes I'm a tourist, but dammm",0
Over priced based on location.  Bring your own food if you are traveling from out of town or try somewhere else.,0
The customer service is not really good....!  Need more Organized...!,0
2 stars for correct food but rude service smh,0
Worst drive thru ever. 45 minutes and counting. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.,0
Slow service gave our food to someone else.,0
None of the table were clean takes long to order and when I do the order takes long and they forget something,0
"archer road in gainesville, the worst of the service, bad treatment to the customers, they give you the hamburguer without meat, in the nights there is never soda, they never take the order correctly",0
Super slow service for a McDonald's.  15 min in the drive thru line and we were at the front of line.,0
"Took forever, about 10 mins in drive through. No sense of urgency at all.",0
Worst McDonalds I have been to in 30 years because of horrible customer service. Left to go to another Mcdonalds at the other end of International just now at 11pm 3-30-2016,0
The staff are rude when you ask to fix your order I come like 3 times a week and the Fry's are dry meat not cook one of the Haitian manager always being smart asking me if I don't like the way to cook them McDonald's 5 minutes away bad service,0
Seriously the slowest mcd I've ever been to.,0

Made a special request on my order. I had to repeat it three times because a staff member ignored it.,0
Took me 40 min to get a soggy milkshake and crunchy fries with MOBILE ordering.,0
Drive thru was so slow and no sauce given when asked and displayed on the screen,0
Awful staff was rude  and place was slow and dirty,0
Do not go here. Employees ignore you after you order and give you attitude when you request something behind the counter or when they forgot something on your order,0
One step slower in service they would go backwards. By the time you get your food it's already cold.,0
Filthy. Took 30 minutes to fill order. Everyone was waiting. Lines backed up. Order was wrong.,0
Incompetent staff....girl taking order didn't know what she was doing...and the lady who brought food out was rude,0
0 Stars no spaghetti,0
Orders senior coffee at the new kiosk and it charges you $0.50 more for using it. Go directly to the cashier!,0
Service is Slow food Quality Bad Old.,0

30 min in drive thru and haven't even made it to the window to pay. Everything else close to hotel is closed.,0
I will never never come back. Bad service! The waitress in red just ignored me when I ask her something.,0
The slowest service i have seen at a McDonald's.,0
"Cashier couldn't understand me and when asking about an item they had on the board, she said they didn't have that. No please, no thank you. Order was not quite right, as it often isn't. Nobody follows instructions. Please retrain staff.",0

"Cold Fries, missing food, wrong food, and no receipt for proof of purchase. This location just opened not that long ago and lack of detail on orders given is already a huge problem. If you want good reviews then pay attention to the people ordering your food. I ran a McDonalds so I know what was not done and the leadership and crew members need work on actually doing what they are both taught and paid to do.",0
"We usually always go before the zoo because it was cutely decorated to the zoo theme and the kids enjoy the experience. Service has always been meh but the atmosphere made up for it. Now it's just a boring, modern McDonald's with bleh service. The remodel was a mistake and if you're going to take away the only appealing part of the place at least make sure the service improves. Probably won't come back during our zoo trips anymore. 占쏙",0
I received my take out spending $ 30.00 My fries were mix old fries . My original chicken combo meat and bun was  burnt.  I try to call no answer. Couldn't return,0
"Unreal, this mcdonalds is garbage. It was cool when it had zoo themed but came back home to visit to find my favorite mcdonalds right off the highway near the new tarnished. Service is always lackluster at best and usually can be very messy inside since the remodel",0
"The McDonald's buy the zoo... pictures say it all.   Food and drinks spilled all over the floor and tables, trash overflowing.  Don't even go in the bathrooms... yikes!!!!  There wasn't a clean table in the whole place!

Everyone was hiding in the back so nobody to take our order for almost 7 minutes.   Had I walked around and noticed the mess, we would have left.

As I'm writing this, I noticed there is a wrapper glued to my shoe.   The only nice person was the homeless lady sitting in the corner.

Don't eat here unless you want to get Ebola",0
"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. More than not, order is wrong in some way. Fries are always soggy.. just UGH!!!",0
"Worst McDonald ever. The workers are really rude, don know how to work, take millions of year to prepare the food OR take your order and when you try to ask for basic things like drinks they treat you bad or ignore you. I waited for them to give me my coke for around 15 minutes and when they finally hand it to me, it was a Dr. pepper, guess what? I waited 10 minutes more for them to have the decency to",0
"After visiting with a friend quite a distance from our home this past week, we stopped off at this McDonald location to get us a late night dinner. I really wanted an Oreo McFlurry and was willing to even settle for some fresh baked or classic McDonald character bag of cookies, but they said that their ice cream machine was down and they were completely out of any and all cookies (sad face). As we pulled away from the drive-thru and continued on our way to our final destination, we realized that they gave us the wrong order. We spent about $20, but only received maybe $5 worth of food. The lobby was closed, the line was long, and we were too tired to turn back. I tried calling this location more than 3 times and even submitted a complaint/help request via the McDonald app to try and get some sort of resolution to their mistake, yet I still have notignoring all of my attempts?",0
They have destroyed their animal themed building and now it's boring. Not worth going to anymore. Why are McDonald's creating such boring buildings? What a waste of money! It doesn't make sense. It's as if they are deliberately trying to lose money and encourage people to stay away.,0
SLOW SLOW SLOW and the younger people there are so RUDE!!! New renovation but same slow workers and RUDENESS ...this past Saturday waited 15 min in drive thru and never placed an order we as many as 10 cars backed out and left,0
"We bought food and drinks with the kids. After playing in the play place we tried to get refills on our sodas and were told they do not offer refills and we would have to buy another. There were no signs or anything stating such, and I've never seen another McDonald's telling people this, so I'm pretty sure the worker just lied to us.",0
"Worst McDonald's ever, sat in the drive thru (2)  for over 10 minutes while the first drive thru the orders were being attended and the second drive thru was ignore, and I finally drove up to place the order and my order was wrong like always worst experience ever bad management.....",0
Person taking orders at drive thru was super rude and very unprofessional. Can believe workers are not getting trained to be professional. I think person was drugged up.,0
"IM SO FREAKING UPSET. WHY WOULD YALL TAKE AWAY THE ZOO ANIMALS. RUINED MY CHILDHOOD. IM SO SAD, ACTUALLY SAD. I CANNOT BELIEVE YALL WOULD REPLACE SUCH A GLORIOUS FUN PLACE WITH SUCH A BORING BLOCK OF A BUILDING. R.I.P. MY HAPPINESS. HEART. SHATTERED.",0
"I can't believe they took away all the amazing animals and put in a Modern Farmhouse McDonald's. The previous McDonald's was iconic. This new renovation just looks like every other new McDonald's, nothing unique about it.",0
BE AWARE : There was a MAN that looked weird. He asked me for money and my boyfriend for a cigarette then he wouldn't leave us ALONE until I said I was calling the cops!!!!The place is cool because of the decorations but  -1 The burger was greasy disgusting -2 French fries NOT fully cooked -3 One of the workers was not even wearing an hat -4 She messed up the order and behind me there was another Lady mad due to a wrong order,0
If you want to watch employee's fight and spend a half a hour waiting on fries and a Frappe this is the McDonalds for you. Service between 5 - 6 am horrible and the 10pm line is backed up onto Ewing Ave. Very Childish and unpleasant employee's.,0
horrible service I waited there for 10 minutes and they never attended me how horrible I will never come again,0

"Extremely hot in play area even after renovation. Customer service not good, French fries are not fresh.",0

Normally every experience I퐒e had at this location has gone smoothly but unfortunately this Sunday when my family and I arrived the employees weren in the best mood. Rushing thru my order and taking it in correctly missing items that were not even on my receipt had to get in line again. The staff very unwilling to help over hearing a conversation with another customer a Hispanic father and young daughter trying to pick up a order and knowing very little English the employee being rude and acting like she couldn understand. Just plain old being disrespectful that my husband had t,0
Apparently when ordering counter pickup after 9 or 10 they don't allow you to and gotta go through drive-through,0
Worst thing here at this location is ordering from the app an waiting for your order over 20 minutes now they need to get better service.,0
"The App let's you order breakfast and pay ahead, but when you show up and it's 10:03, their system won't let them complete your order.

The location is relatively good, the employees are always friend and fast.

But someone needs to pass along yo the corporate office/app devs and need to either decide to

1) prepare prepaid breakfast orders and have them ready before the 10:00 shut off, or

2) allow them to prepare my prepaid breakfast order 3 minutes after ""it's no longer breakfast time""

I do not want to eat a burger as my first meal of the day at 10:03 on the way to work.",0
Horrible costumer service the lady taking my order never even talked to me I even told her thank you after she had taken my order to be polite and she just turned around she filled the fries I didnt even care to complain but as u can tell from the picture I would have got more out of a small at most mcdonalds,0
The food was good but only 1 stall for going to the restroom,0
I can believe how rude this people is,0
Rude staff complaining about us sitting at a table. All because they don want to do their job. Should of ,0
"Update. Placed an order at the counter. Attendant took my order, upon me handing her my cash I was told she didn't have all my change and would that be OK. I said no and left. Great scam Manager, round up, why not round down?",0
Used to be a fun place to go to but everything has changed,0
Gave me wrong order. She doesn,0
"So, I got to this location frequently, despite hearing the horror stories about this location, because it is close to me. Well, tonight my order was messed up and they yelled at me about it.
First, I tell the person taking my order that I would like a Bacon Double Quarter Pounder w/ Cheese, Tea for the drink, make the combo a large. So, the first thing we have a discussion about is that he gave me an unsweetened tea on the screen. I tell him I would like a sweet tea for the drink, and he tells me that I ordered it wrong. I said, ""Well, normally when I come here, they default to sweet tea."" I said that because they usually do  He said, ""Nah! That's not how we do it. Then, he clears the entire order and puts in a Quarter Pounder with Cheese.

I tell him that I ordered a Bacon Double Quarter with Cheese, sweet tea, and make the combo a large. I saw that it was not right on the screen, but he repeated the order to me correctly.  I pulled around to pay for the order and waited on it to be served to me. I checked the order and told the person at the window that it was not a double. The person at the window talked to the person who took my order, and he came to the window and yelled, ""I MADE WHAT YOU ORDERED."" I told him that I said ""double"" several times when I ordered, 5 times to be exact. He person who took my order, who looked to be a manager, yelled at me, ""NO! IT WAS THE WAY YOU ORDERED IT. YOU ASKED FOR A SINGLE.""

I repeated that I asked for a Bacon Double Quarter with cheese and he started arguing with me about how to order sweet tea. He finally told me that he would make it order, but I did not trust him at this point, so I said that I was leaving and I would not be back.

This was an awful experience and I will not be back. I will also tell my friends and family to avoid this location despite that it has served our community over 10 years.",0
When this McDonald's first opened. OMG it was cool seeing the zoo theme. The animatronics made noise and moved. The service WAS excellent. But now it looks like a tourist trap. Some days you'll sit at the drive through line for a long time then get told to wait in a parking spot. Whoever owns this franchise should be proud of it and maintain it's quality that it had. As far as the food goes. Well it's McDonald's same as any other.,0
Never get my order correct always something missing !!!!!,0
Line is ridiculous. They need new and faster workers,0
Worst and slowest McDonald's I've ever been.,0
"Staff was very rude, not the one at the counter but the manager was yelling at me to come get our food. Me being pregnant and just visiting the zoo, I was letting my husband get the food after he was finished getting the kids drinks as the lady continuously yelled at me to get my food! Very unprofessional.",0
"Went to drive thru window at around 11:30 ish and employee with copper tone hair like was very rude and disrespectful I was gonna ask her a question about another order that I wanted added to my order and she rudely said no , when I get to th window I asked her if that was her that I was talking to she said yes talking about that there only two employees working mind u it customer service how hard can that be also wen I get my food and I get home I checked my food and it was spitt on my food , I understand that you guys ar understaffed but that is no way to give customer service I will be making sure that",0
First I only added the 1 star because that's the only way to do a review ... I  had 4 drinks so full they were spilling through the lids.. the woman at the window saw it spilling and still passed while they were dripping... guessing she saw a look on my face... this woman looked me in my face and said it's just a little bit... and closed the window ... so I she came back to the window with half of my order... my son opened his cheese burger and looks like a arm hair... a eyebrow... or puuuuub (maybe)... I asked for napkins she gave me sooo many napkins... I'm like you should've fix this before you gave it to me.. i. worst of the worst experience... ,0
Rudest night crew I've ever experienced. The boy they have acting as a manager is horrible and very unprofessional. All they do is blast rap music and play with each other and be rude to the customers.,0
"Night employees are stealing from customers, and probably the restaurant as well.
They short changed me twice on the same order, and claimed the receipt machine was ""not working"" when i asked for the receipt.",0
"I could not eat the food from the zoo McDonald's so I gave the food to the cats outside...and the cats outside my house did not even take a wiff at it...idk?
Becarefull with the food up there in the Zoo McDonald's?",0
I used to love McDonald's fries but not no more. You can't never really get anything fresh from McDonald's. I used to tell them could they make my McChicken now when they did it taste so much better. But everything is preheated or been waiting for you LOL,0
"They where not friendly. The girl at the drive through was on her phone and didnt give us change or receipt. Got to the 2nd window was handed our drinks and asked to pull in a spot. Waited at least 15 mins before anyone came out to our car. Asked what we ordered....and for our receipt ..which we didnt have....
Finally brought our food out and 2 burgers where wrong...",0
My order was handed to someone else who IMMEDIATELY ATE MY FRIES! MGMT OFFERED TO REMAKE MY ORDER FRESH WHICH I AGREED. THE ORDER CAME OUT LESS THAN 30SECS LATER. I USED TO WORK FOR MC.Ds AND OTHER FF RESTAURANTS AND I KNEW THAT WASN'T RIGHT!! TRASHED THE FOOD.SMDH!!!0,0
"Just avoid. This was by far the worst experience I've ever had with a McDonald's. I feel like you have to be trying to be terrible to be as bad as this location. There are other McDonald's close by, don't bother with this place.",0
"DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS MCDONALDS.
I ORDERED 4 MEALS THROUGH UBER EATS
AND ALL I GOT WAS THE BURGERS
NO FRIES
NO SAUCES
NO DRINKS!!!!
I EVEN ORDERED A MCFLURRY.
ALL I GOT WAS BURGERS.",0
Why remove the animals??.. This remodel looks cold & uninviting.. Horrible,0
"Food was definitely not even close to being fresh ""ish""and the location, although you'd think is convenient after visiting the zoo ... It's a wreck waiting to happen if you try to drive in to their location.",0
Who idea was it to destroy the famous zoo McDonalds ??? I hope revenue sales go down the drain.,0
In drive through at 10:58 AM- tried ordering lunch. I was told they couldn't take my order. I told them I'd just wait 2 minutes... LIke the car ahead of me that took 5 minutes to order. No big deal right? Nope manager comes out and yells at me to move/pull around she didn't care... I just had to move. 1 car was behind me still ordering. Would have thought I was blocking a fire escape or something. By the time I actually got through the drive through (due to cars ahead of me) it was 11:01AM... Really smart move guys. I'll happily take my business elsewhere. No longer stopping by after zoo trips with the kids.,0
"I work five minutes away from this store, so I go there all the time. Everytime I go there's a problem. This time my bun was so hard. The bottom bun. There's always something wrong. I worked for this same company for a lot of years,(swing manager). It's crazy. I've only got good service once or twice there.",0
Did not know that at this mc Donald u have to wait 30 min to get your dam order wat happen to fast food when you went and left 10 min later its crazy,0
Worst people ever. The girls were being rude for no reason. The zoo theme outside is very nice but the customer service was the worst. We asked a question and she slammed the window on us,0
Wow!!  Today I went through the drive thru.  The cashier freaked out when I presented a discount coupon.   The cashier told me the receipt printer was out of paper.  When I pulled forward to the food pickup window.  I informed them and requested my receipt.  It turns out the cashier was lying just hiding the fact I was charge double on my credit card.  I waited 7 additional minutes for my tiny order to be prepared.  I brought to their attention about the overcharge.  They said to call and they will take care of it over the phone.  I have been calling the entire day.  No answer.,0
"Awful experience. It was 10:15 and I needed a sweet tea and nuggets. I order my tea in the drive through line. The line was pretty long. When I got to the window to pay the cashier with light brown eyes, said they could only take cash. I said, what!!! I have stayed in this line this long and no one said a word!! I said, for my inconvenience I would like to have the tea. She looked strange, and I said please let me speak to your manager. She spoke to someone, and the manager said no and wouldn't come to the window. AWFUL!!!",0
"Zari was absolutely incompetent! We specifically ordered 4 meals to be placed in 4 separate bags during the first stage of ordering (as they were for 4 people). When we requested this again at her window, she rolled her eyes, huffed, and began changing them out. She also gave me 3 Cokes and 1 diet Coke (for the diabetic in the group). They didn't mark the diet Coke so she told us that it was the wrong one! Luckily there was no need for a hospital visit due to her total lack of concern for safety and health!",0
"Always something with this location. Either system down, only cash or sometimes no respond on the drive thru at nights",0
Well what can I say I use to work mc Donalds and their custermer  service  was great I went to drive through  tonight no one help me on the speaker so I drove  to the window the cashier tell no that will need to go back in line and order again that he could get my order at the window I was in line for good 10 15 mn then I go to  the window to talk to manger nothing and he just left to the back and ignored  the custermer in the front he was asking for him to get him something  he did not get any help he left I drove up then he was not there at all with a big line I went back to the drive thru and well to oder then he tel their is no ice scream so I get inline again for nothing had to stay in line until they served every one in front and again no one in the windows to help  but just the some  need to ck cause I have it all in video  I will posting it on line to she how horrible  custermer service  Mc Donald's  have compare to Chick-fil-A  they don't come close of the quality  and custermer service they have and people need to start speaking about  Mc how not only tge drive thru people wait for 20 to 30 mn some all the pollution but that's another story I hope this makes some ck this out,0
"Went today after the zoo, it was a very bad experience to say the least.
We were given over seasoned  fries, one straw for three drinks, and the drinks were all bad.
I thought how do you mess up a drink?
It is my belief that this was attributed to the mistake that was made with coffee order wanted moca frap was given hot coffee.
She took all drinks back and brought tray back with correction.
It tasted like instead of coffee mixture it was blended with old filtered out deposits, I mean really sour.
The manager however corrected the moca and recooked fries.
When we left a second time I tasted the unsweetened tea and Coke... It was horrible foul I thought omg I almost served this to my kids!!
Will not ever return.",0
"Doesn't deserve one star! Waited in line 30 minutes. When we finally ordered the girl couldn't get the order right after 3 attempts. When we got to the pay window, the girl was talking on her cell phone. When I asked her to repeat my order, she looked at me crazy. When we got our order it was disgusting. Soggy oily fries, burned chicken nuggets, water down soda ... plain disgusting. They need new management for sure!!! Someone please contact corporate!!!!!",0
These teenagers with bad customer service have the worst attitudes and are lazy. I bet the hiring manager is the same way considering her terrible hires. I wouldn give this place one star. The only good person I,0
I ordered a 6 piece nuggets and 3 chocolate chip cookies I got my nuggets and had to wait 15 minutes for the cookies I had to call and let them know I was still waiting in reserve 1,0
I was disappointed that the play area was closed due to it being filthy and the speakers were blown so the animal noises were bursts of LOUD static.,0
"Same ol"" ready in 2 minutes food. Idk how they do it . But ramen needs to step up their game because it takes longer to cook noodles in the microwave . Great Job Mickey D's",0
"My wife and I was going to this McDonald's for some morning when they had another crew. But here recently they changed the morning to a new crew(an old man, a young vanity lady at the drive through window that is very rude). This crew need to be removed. They never seemed to know how to work and prepare your order in a timely manner. This facility is also made where you can't just get out of line in the drive through which is very dangerous if a car stalls or a real emergency arrives. We will be skipping visiting the morning crew. Plz. change crew or train them better.",0
"Would have have it a negative if possible. I have went to this location for the last time. Drive through you will sit at the speaker for 2 minutes before they even say anything to you but you can hear them talking/laughing/and cursing to each other. POOR MANAGEMENT. THEN, my order was wrong so I go inside to get a refund only to see my receipt had about 15 streks of ink on it nothing legible. SO I go inside and say I would like my money back and the manager just shrugs me off like it doesn't effect her. If you are going to the Dallas Zoo drive further and don't let this McDonald's ruin your day. TRUST ME.",0
"Horrible place....rude employees, burnt fries, and fudge sundae had fudge all over top and outside of plastic top. .",0
"Be careful with young children here! We had a women approach our booth and asked personal questions about my young niece while my brother was getting the food. We tried to dismiss her and did not answer her questions, but she just sat herself in our booth uninvited. We asked her to leave several times, because it was very uncomfortable. She just continued to sit and stare at my neice. We made it clear we were having a private lunch and would like her to leave.
Then the women's boyfriend called her back to his table, she left us and then they walked out shortly after.
Another patron approached us after the women left our table because she believed the women was planning to abduct my niece. She noticed the women staring at my niece and told us to be safe. When we left they were parked next to our truck as well. We will definitely not be going back there.",0
Dirty! Dirty! Dirty! We saw previous customers coming back to get their orders fixed. Every table in the play place was awful. (Ours had spilled milk). The employee took one trash can out but didn pick up the trays and didn clean up the busted bbq sauce on the floor. What was also bad was that we moved to another table and the floor was covered with napk,0
Terrible for getting rid of the zoo decor.,0
"***Deserves No Stars What So Ever !***

This Place Is By Far The Worst! The drive threw lady  on 12/6/17 was absolutely rude! I came  to get some breakfast around 10:45 she continusly kept asking me"" is that it?"" I asked for a minute to see the menu. Then within a ""Second"" she asked if I was done with my order!  Sausage burritos had No Sausage. Orange Juice Cups Were Only Filled Half Way. Hash browns were cold ! By far the worst service ever! Your management needs to  work on their employees attitudes !",0
"Well it might have been ok, if I was not rushing, but I still stayed for my items. For this to be McDonald's, they should know that it's busier during certain hours then others..there were soo many ppl in line, the average person would have turn right back around n walked out.",0
The service could be better they always forget to give you condiments and napkins. Even after you've ask. Then soon as you drive away.  You have to come back and go inside and explain that you were lied to.,0
The employees are very rude one of them snatched a bag out of my boyfriends hands because they messed up our order and when we complained to the manager she laughed and did nothing about it. I would expect better seeing is how it,0
Their icecream machine was broke. They didnt have any toys for the happymeals. The tables were disgusting. And I counldnt understand the cashier. Plus she was using 2 registers at once!!!!! If i could give negative stars i would!,0
"This mc donalds is very slow and the employees are rude and always have an attitude when you ask to get your order fresh . I always count on this mc donalds not to mess up with my order but they ALWAYS do . Also they tell you to wait on the 1 or 2 waiting spot but never come out with your food . Today i ordered chicken nuggets and asked for them to be fresh , they were ok until i noticed that the chicken was BLACK inside one of the nuggets . Maybe was black inside of more of them and i didnt notice . I have picture proof as well . This mc donalds is just trash .",0
Worst experience ever. I pay for large fries and only fill it half way. I said if I want a medium I'll pay for a medium. Now fill this up or give me my money back. Service is just the worst I've seen. I really recommend people to not go there. Waste of time and will leave you with a headache,0
"Very Disappointed, 40 minutes to get my food due to short of staff per shift leader. No manager to get my money refunded. I've waited in the drive-thru. No apology whatsoever from that shift leader.  Will call coporate office myself.  My order was all screwed up.",0
"The drive thru took forever and it was 10p!! The young attendant felt the need to chat with the car in front of me for a full 7 mins. Doesn't sound ridiculous until you're sitting there watching it with a full line of impatient cars behind you. Then when I pulled up the kid realized he never handed back the guy's credit card, and started laughing about it. His co-worker was shaking her head saying ""it was cuz you got distracted talking to him about guns for so long"" ...
To add insult to injury, I got my food, I had to remind the kid about my drinks that I ordered, I left, and my food was cold and my order was wrong.",0
"A worker called MY order number so obviously I'm gonna grab it. It didn't even occur to me to look at the tray the only thing I noticed was that I was missing a coffee so I set the tray on the table and on my way back I see the manager yelling at my family about how WE grabbed the wrong order and see at first we tried being cool about it. She said she was taking back the extra food and we said that was fine so then she starts grabbing the food we ordered and says we weren't charged for that, after an interesting conversation we establish that my receipt clearly said I was charged. Ten minutes later they've manned to give two BIG orders but haven't managed to give me a bacon egg mcgriddle. So eventually I get the burger and as the manager hands it to me she's telling a worker she gave us 8 hash browns. I obviously heard her and said ""no ma'am, we got 4"" this same manager then has the audacity to say we already ate them. At this point I'm pissed. I've been accused of not paying for my part of the food, I'm hungry, I've waited way too long, the manager has an attitude, AND she's a accusing my family of eating 4 hash browns in less than a minute. NEVER eating at this McDonald's again. Especially with a manager like that.",0
"I eat at this McDonalds at least 4 times a week. Never again. The service is always questionable and the drive thru order is screwed up as often as not. Had to wait at drive-thru order 5 full minutes before giving my order. That's at the speaker, not in line. Was told (rather rudely) to wait several times. When given the order, the server practically threw the bag at me and disappeared. When I got to work, I found I had to eat my hotcakes with no plasticware, no syrup or butter and not even a napkin. Calls placed to the store went unanswered. Poor service all around.",0
Burgers are always flat. Good for on the road food. I sure do miss the dollar menus tho. And they charge for mayo if you add it but not if you get packets.. humm,0
Worst experience ever!! They closed the lobby early!! Then the manager found out people were still coming in and started yelling!! The nice officer apologized for her attitude and gave us complimentary drinks for patiently waiting for our burger. She needs to go over a customer service training again or find another job!!,0
"9/3/18 @ 1:50pm I came by McDonalds today and I went through the drive through the girl that takes your order did not even bother to Greet me and take my order she was just talking so much I guess she did not know she was gossiping and knew we can hear her but she was saying the most rudest things through speaker, it seems like she was talking to another employer. I kept saying helloo hellooo helloo and did not even bother to stop talking. Then when I pulled up to the first window the one that was so rude was the one that has a ring in her nose she is african american she did not even bother to repeat my order and did not offer to give me receipt. There was another girl next to her biting off her Acrylic Nails and was falling all over the table where the order computer were at SO DISGUSTING! I used to work here things have changed and these ghetto girls are so RUDE! At the pick up window that lady was so sweet she had a smile and greated us well.",0
I am really surprised that McDonald refused service for food at 4:00 am when we were starving and reached there for food. The lady at the dr,0
Their ubereats need to be more attention to detail n packed nice not just thrown in always missing something i asked for bought the big breakfast meal and got sent no silverware no syrup nothing like Damn how am i going to eat this i even put a note in the app to add napkins and condiment n still can't receive it what's the point of leaving a note if no one reads it I've order different times and never fail to disappoint me,0
Terrible service. 2 minutes off breakfast and wouldn't serve us anything. They had bad service took 20 minutes to get through drive through. Not fast food and quality was the worst mcdonald's I've ever had,0
DO NOT EAT AT THIS MCDONALD'S TILL THEY BRING THE ANIMALS BACK!!!!!!,0
"Staff was great, but cook are trash...
How can you screw up a simple burger? when you don't care that's how...",0
My order is always wrong. I was making my order in the drive through she ask me what I wanted to drink when I answer she we have no soda.smh,0
"Horrible service, I'm just done with McDonald's. I tried a few different locations and apparently none of them can offer a friendly service i will just take my money somewhere else.",0
Disgusting food and terrible service. If your ever in the area make sure to right past this place. Dont even look it's way. You will get sick if you eat this garbage and I mean in the worse way. I wouldn't feed this stuff to animals. I wouldnt eat this stuff if I was starving. Horrible end of story,0
They forgot what people order.... I order 5 ice cream and they just give me one n they say that is everything.... Them i show them the receipt n i had to wait 10 more minutes for the order 4 cones they dont napkins.......,0
The employees cannot count for nothing. On top of that the coffee tasted like cardboard it's very obvious they do not clean their machines. Disgusting store.,0
Good food. I waited 15 minutes for one bacon cheeseburger. The store is very sloppy it look like a hurricane came through. They were understaffed. I deserve a free meal for that experience.,0
My family and I get to this McDonald's we are shocked it looked so nice from the outside and they have the jungle themed play house. I ask if they have an outlet so that I may charge my laptop and phone and no. The Wi-Fi here is not even strong enough. I could not complete my homework.  Bummed out.  Not the best as usual.,0
The customer service is just not what it used to be. There is no Welcome to McDonalds just how can i help. I ended up payimg for someone elses order. At 1st i thought it was more but it was 20 cents less. I'm glad i only go there for drinks.,0
The service was alful everyone working the front was either on there phone or joking around. They got my order wrong twice. New management is needed and a whole new crew to go with it.,0
"Stopped to grab some food and go to the restroom. RESTROOM WAS SO nasty ,with wet stuff all over the floor, no toilet paper and toilets were nasty.We walked out of the restroom, I told hubby no tissue paper .He said let's go this whole place is nasty. Trash can was overflowing around the floor ,all tables dirty and and no jungle sounds coming from the animals .. Disgusting.  THEY only had 2 families sitting in  the dinning room and 2 families in line ..",0
"I was just at the drive thru, my son wanted some breakfast number 13 and the girl just kept on saying, no maam, no maam, what the hell you mean no maam.....well she said that is not a breakfast,  uuuhhhhh yes it is, well she decided to tell me to wait, well I'm already mad because she doesn't tell me why can't I get it and to top it of she's taking her time, I just told her to forget it and she says, well ok,,,,,I had to stop at the window and ask her what she meant, ,,,oh lord ....she talked to me like I'm stupid or dumb,,,,,she's like well we only have that...and points to a sign on the window with the all day breakfast menu, if she would of explain that through the speaker. ...I wouldn't be complaining now, so I told her she should of explained that to me, she told me ""oh well"", si ,  left, and  here I am at Jack in the box enjoying breakfast with my boys,,,,no issues and great customer service. .....one thing for sure I will be doing, is telling my family and friends not to go there,,,,,,",0
"So today.. 11-4-18 about 4:30 am. I stop at this McDonald's by the dallas zoo i order a bacon egg and cheese biscuit and a large drink, i get to the window and she says 8$ and some change,  i say FOR WHAT???  SHE SAY you ordered the combo, right.? I say NO JUST THE DRINK AND THE BISCUIT SANDWICH... SHE SAY ok..... And then she charge me 4$ and some change... So WTH was she charging me for.. She even say YEAH THOSE COMBOS ARE EXPENSIVE!! WITH A SE",0
"You can't pay me to eat there. I heard about that food online. Try the meat at home
and french fries leave it out for two weeks and it never turn bad. What the hell is in that food. Everything look good...ain't good for you.",0
"Today June 22, 2017 at 21:05 aka 8:25 my order was taking in drive thru I ask for Double chesse burger with no oins and no pickles with large sweet tea extra ice add lemon. So my drink had no extra ice or lemon and frys I drive home to eat my food which I stay 22 mints away from store it by my school... I get hone to open my bag to have only receive Hot & Spicey and no Fry's which was not my order and young lady at both windows ready my order back. I have called the store 8 times to speak with manager and nobody has pick up the phone",0
Manager at this establishment is very disrespectful and doesn't want to do her job. Do to the fact of this the line was held up for over 30 minutes. Wouldn't recommend this McDonald's to anyone,0
This location needs serious rehabbing. Only drive thru service. The line was wrapped around building and onto the street. My food was cold fries old n refried burned...smh... NEVA AGAIN,0
Let me put it this way... GETTO. Most of the employees are on the phone and acting like they are at the park. Need to be more Profesional and get this place more clean. Frys taste like old oil. Macdonald fix this place please! The place is nice just need to work on your employees.,0
"I want to add a small fry at the window after I ordered at the speaker n the black lady   refused to add, and I'm asking for the manager and she said I can't  because you ordered is ready... she was black and  without uniform how the MANAGER  come to the window n tell me she can't... 05/25/19 in the  afternoon",0
I like that it is animal theme and has a playground but the cashiers are rude and they can't get your order right so they get mad when you tell them you are missing something. Also they are dirty.,0
"Stopped by for a quick grab on my way home.
Got my burger wrong but the drive through line was too long so I feed it to the birds. (10:30pm)",0
"Horrible, First my nephews cheeseburger, The bun was to hard to cut through then the burger patty was old. I know bad buns and burgers, Ive worked at a McDonald's. Second was my Mcflurry, I ordered the oreo Mcflurry. She put the oreos on the top and didnt mix then in and when i asked her to mix it. She said ""We dont do that."" BUT THE MCFLURRY MACHINE WAS BEHIND HER?!? Then she rolled her eyes at me! NEVER GOING HER AGAIN! HORRIBLE SERVICE! HORRIBLE FOOD!",0
Worst experience ever. Customer service is the worst in this location. The staff working 6/16/19 at 3:00am is the worst. The messed up the orders and didn,0
I was just there this morning; to order a couple meals to go ; the word is TO GO right? Okay so we order and tell me why my food was wrong and I didn't get my iced coffee ?And when the cashier asked if it were for here or to go; I said to go. Hmm they always mess up orders and nevertheless get them right; the floors are always sticky and dirty as well some tables no where to really sit. Bad to come here,0
"I went this week end with my kids the indoor play ground smells like a mens gym
the temperature was warm inside there for the activity needs to be cooler. The outside ketchup dispensers don't work and the servers get upset when you ask for more ketchup or sauces. If I order a 20pc chicken nugget and 4 med fries I will need more than 2 bbq sauce and 4 packages of ketchup. Plus a Vagrant was hitting people up for money inside the restaurant. Not going back ever again you guys need to clean up that place",0
"I had to ask for every single little thing.  Ie: napkins,  catsup,  spoons for the sundays,  peanuts,  extra peanuts. My receipt. Clearly she didn't want to be at work.  SMH. 0 RATING.",0
Did not provide a receipt and didn't give us the chocolate milk in happy meal! Rude service. Shame on this location ,0
Terrible food and terrible service. While waiting at the window someone started yelling at the employee in which he stopped to yell back and call her a bit** and tell her that someone named bebe won't be in till 5. Highly inappropriate and I felt I should have drove off which would have been the better decision. No one should ever go here and they should rethink the staff,0
Doesn't deserve a single star. My burger was slopply made and half sticking out of the box. Way to much pepper poured on the chicken and gave us a drink instead of a shake that I ordered. By far the worse mcdonalds in Texas area. Would never come back and rather drive out of Dallas to order my food at another Mcdonalds.,0
"Every time I come here they never get the order right, and if they do they never give the correct sauce. It don",0
Probably the worst McDonald,0
"The people from the night shift they are so very rude ! I pass tru last nite and i try to buy a burger the manager told me on the speaker i em not ready yet  WTF , it was only me on the drive tru , the i wen araund and she was talking to her boyfriend on a black chalenger selling drugs and smoking weed they sell DRUGS TRU THE NITE OMG !!!!",0
Horrible customer service. I ordered waited 5 min at the window and ask me 3 time what my order was. Then was told to pull up and waited 8 more min and  no one came out. So I went inside and they forgot about my order.,0
"Awful. Just awful. 1030 at night, waited 20 minutes in drive through, finally got to window (after being harassed by homeless people) and told manager I didn't think I should have to pay for food after waiting 20 minutes. All I got was a bunch of children that gave me grief. Unacceptable.",0
"I came there with a fiend and we were told a price for our total, and after I arrived at the window the lady charged me another $5 dollars. Really? I did pay them, but come on.",0
Always great to go there but they need to work on giving food or right to there customers several cases of not handing me the right stuff,0
Theme has been removed...,0
Leave Don Sp,0
"A mess all trash overflowing cashier more worried about who didn't come to work . I expected better from this md,s by the zoo. Clean up people.",0
Horrible .. received a cheese burger with literally 7 slices of cheese on it. When we came back to change it we sat in the drive thru for 5 minutes while the cashier talked to her friend in the drive thru.,0
"Cashier and staff made us feel very unwelcome. Unfriendly staff. Very rude and disrespectful. Needless to say, we didnt stay.",0
I had to wait 15 minutes for a Happy Meal and Mc Chicken sandwich. The person bringing your order had  no mask on.,0
They just put the fries back in the oil so you think there.fresh and fries didnt even had salt also the fries had alot of oil and the meat was not fresh the buns were hard   I try to call back and they never answer the phone these happen in the night shift,0
Cancelled my order today due to the fact this location doesn't serve water. Cancelled my family's order. How can I wash this greasy food down if cant even buy water here. Blows my mind,0
"Same as Jack in the Box, they mess up your order because they can't hear out of those stupid headsets, then there's another charge, & more wait time.",0
This place customer service is TRASSSSSH throw the whole McDonald's away NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! By the way I HAD TO ADD A 占쏙,0
These people are slow as hell. I waited for 20 minutes for some yogurt. 20 minutes!! Don't come here until they hire better people,0
Kids love McDonald's but when people making drug deals in the parking lot there is an issue.,0
The very poor and unsatisfactory customer service reflects the equally subpar food products being sold here. I pray to see the day this franchise leaves this earth like the black plague.,0
Past service has been good until recently went in stood for about three minutes at the counter while olga laughed and giggled it took a person from the back to ask me did I need help  and take my order and no it was not busy,0
"Food was cold as their heart. And the classic, they forgot to add the barbecue!",0
I ordered a caramel machiatto and it tasted really spoiled. Last time I will be visiting here.,0
Until they do the upgrades at this store in this area just throw the whole store away.  The entire crew needs training just to fix a mocha coffee sad real sad.,0
No one should have to wait more than 20 minutes in a drive-thru lane at a fast food restaurant for their order.,0
"Dirty,service so Slow,Only Odered a shake,friends ordered to eat here a very large order & it was served to go,Cashier rigging her nose,sniffiling",0
"Poor customer service skills, consistently mess up orders. We drive 4 miles further to a better location more often than not.",0
"It was  very bad. In the wrong side of the neighborhood  .  Road was all messed up .
Employees were very dis respectful",0
Can't even give it a star it was nazty service sucked too many things just going wrong all at once decided to go else where ooooh and who in the hell has a bday party at the McDonald's at the zoo really I know ,0
There were no cars in front of me and it took over ten minutes for them to take my order. I would have left if I hadn't had a starving 5 year old with me.,0
Restaurant very dirty trashcans were full the whole hour I was there. No one even wiped down a table. Sad to see there is no pride in anything.,0
this is my second time going through drive thru in the same person gave me my food with an attitude if u do not like your job dont work. on 3-29-2019 07:30pm,0
I used to not have issues with the location I went to last night but in recent months they have been giving me the wrong order or not giving me my whole order amd when I went last night the night employees came off like they hated their job and didnt care about customers,0
BRING BACK THE ANIMALS,0
Roaches in this place. They have totally let it get run down. Hope you enjoy your McRoaches,0
They don't know the definition of costumer service.  Wrong order twice on 1 day.  They respond so rude . Horrible experience avoid this place,0
My fries were cold (thats all I ordered) and took 14 minutes.,0
No wifi,0
"Customer service is bad, they were super slow. They did not complete my order and when I asked them for the rest of the stuff, no apology when they handed it to me.",0
WHY DID THEY REMODEL THIS GEM,0
"This manager tru me out.
Siad a was not welcome n his store just cus o told they need open at 5 am",0
better than most.but the burger meat was cold fries was hot and good tho,0
Beware they walk away with to the back with your bank. They not suppose to do that. I went off on the cashier. I will be calling up there to speak with a manager,0
We are relying on the workers to take the orders correctly.  Thanks for coffe with no cream or equal.,0
"Worst McDonald's food ever. Mcchicken was so dried out I couldn't even eat it, the service was terrible and the guy at the window was rude and was cussing with employees while we were at the window. Smh",0
Went in late visiting from out of state thinking lobby was open since door was open and manager acted like we broke in and threatened to call cops if we didnt immedietly leave. Very rude,0
Went to order something to go .. I get it that there a long line that,0
Depends on the worker that you get can either be really nice or really rude! What can you expect from McDonalds in oak cliff?!,0
I saw them hand mixing a shake and my Mcflurry wasnt even mixed. Best thing here are the animal sculptures.,0
Just a rude staff who seem to have a bad attitude.  Order was correct and fine just rude people.,0
By far one of the dirtiest McDonald's I've ever been to. 10 dirty tables the entire time we were there. No hand sanitizer...,0
No electric outlets to charge phones!!!!  This McDonald location is falling back hard. The staff have very poor work ethics. Tattoos and lack of respect are prominent here.,0
Over run with pan handlers and drug users. I didn't even feel safe in drive thru.,0
Fries were hard and cold tasted like they were from the bottom of the pan and nuggets were old and nasty. Never will go here again!,0
Slow service and the food was wrong not once but twice. Complete waste of time and money,0
"Very bad customer service, i didn't even get a thank you. They  made me way long time for my order",0
Food was terrible. My friend and I both threw up after a few bites.  Ordered a coke and got a dr pepper,0
"They always get my order wrong, either they don't give me something ,or they give me the wrong thing.",0
Bad service. Very dirty. Bums are everywhere  begging for something. And did i mention very dirty? I'd go somewhere else next time.,0
I asked for a side of Big Mac sauce a did not receive any also I ask for large fries and got a small instead and to top if they assumed I spoke Spanish how rude!!,0
They was loud and had attudes and hanging all out the window my food was cold this was a bad place to eat at,0
"Sign said dining room open, but doors were locked.",0
Service was bad waited a long time for my food and coffee. Then they gave me the wrong coffee,0
They messed up my order and did not want to fix it,0
It would be nice place if you could enjoy your meal without people asking for money the whole time,0
Never get your order right!! And when let them know they got your order wrong... They get mad smh,0
Service was very slow. 10 minutes for 1 egg mcmuffin. No apologies for the long delay.,0
The person taking our order took forever to get on the speaker because the crew were all inside playing around.He was rude on the speaker as they continued to play and laugh.,0
Rude!!!!.....and they gave me the wrong order.,0
Stop by here February 16 in the morning at 6:00 am I waited 20 minutes and they gave me the wrong order in the end they have no service and I asked for sauces for my food and they didn't have what kind of store is this,0
Check you food good because my wife had chewed into a frie that she thought was burnt but no she spot it out and we checked it out who knows what it was but it smelled really really bad and tasted nasty my wife said,0
Pure attitude from young lady at window.  Not a place I will go to ever again.,0
"This McDonald's is slow and they're always messing up your order..you go through the drive for fast service, only to have to wait 10 to 15 minutes for your food...AFTER you've already waited 10 minutes in line to pay..its ridiculous..",0

I order through Uber Eats often. Every single time I order Chicken nuggets they Always forget to put the Barbeque Sauce I Requested in the bag. Always!! It's not nice. It's not ok. I order 40 Nuggets. 40 and not one Sauce in the bag. This has happened too many times. I'm sick of it. Today they also forgot to send an item I paid for. I'm done with this location.,0
"I came today at this store at 9pm and the person in charge scream from a table to us.

She said in a rude way: if you order your food will not be prepared. And she closed the computer. I didnt said anything to that woman, because im not wasting my time and energy with  people as rude like that.

It's McDonald's so I don't expect much if anything but the people running this one don't have a care in the world. Staff walking around in the back wearing scruffy old pyjamas looking street wear. (ie not the uniform and not even clean looking personal clothes) No hairnets. Kiosks not working. Slow service at the counter and long wait for food. Missing items. I could go on.,0
"The worst McDonald I have ever been to! First we waited in one of the drive through lane for over 15 minutes just to find out it was out our order. No signs and no one notifying the customers. The other lane was long so I parked and ordered online for curbside pick up. After waiting for a while, no one deliver my food so went inside believing maybe they were short staffed but the employees were chatting and wondering around. order.
Even more disappointing, fries were cold and soggy. What happened to the tomato, lettuce and mayo in ",0
"Worst McDonald's I've ever been to. On Friday, February 17th, it was closed at 9:41pm. Wth? Really? Couldn't believe it. Staff that turned me away wasn't very polite either. What is this? Chucky cheese or something? Although I think even they stay open longer than that, Friday night c'mon. I hope someone from corporate will read this, might as well shut this dump down if you're gonna close around 9 on weekends",0
Slowest fast food restaurant I퐒e ever gone to. I,0
I went today to get food and they said two times they were not open. It clearly states they are open 24 hours. I asked nicely twice why they were closed and all I got was we are closed. Not professional at all and not right. I understand things happen but why no answer back? But the whole place is lit up. Just give me an answer.,0
"Came here at 4 in the morning and they told me they are closed, but right before I drove up to the window there was another guy Infront of me that they served. Something else funny has happened at this McDonald's before! I went there in person to get a milkshake but they told me they don't have it, when I got home I went on Uber eats and ordered a milkshake from that same McDonald's XD. LOL",0
"For workers like her big companies' name are ashamed.

What a horrific experience I just had;  this lady you see in the picture for telling her she was giving me a wrong item and not the one I paid for she started a big drama and spilt my son's smoothie and started singing a vulgar song/lyrics as per offending me through that and not directly addressed to me. All that in front of the manager ..

Besides that waiting time was ridiculous long with a lot of customers not satisfied and even a uber eats guy had to cancel in front of  me because they didn't make his order in more than 20 min that I was there ...

Another lady in the back was not using the yellow paper that sandwiches have she was placing the  buns/bread directly on the table as she was preparing food for dogs. She saw me and start acting like nothing happened..

This place is a completely mess

JUST STAY AWAY",0
We spent more than half an hour in the drive through. One person is doing all the work. The ice cream machine is not working as well as the milk shake :(,0
"They keep talking to me when I told them that I am deaf and they gesture that the app is not working as I thought. I typed the orders then show them and I give them a card but they finally typed the phone, said only cash. They waste my 10 minutes time for nothing. Poor service! Non-friendly disability!",0
"Pure and utter trash, was in line after ordering for about 40min just to get stale fries, and tried passing diet coke for coke. Very distinct taste.
If you're wondering, Fyi there was no way out of the line",0

TERRIBLE service they took 10 minutes to take my order when no one was in line. Then in the next lane someone pulled up had waited 5 seconds before someone took their order before me who had be been waiting. They charged me the wrong food and never got my correct receipt. Next window they lost my order and then got it wrong after I said very clearly what i wanted and it wasn't a complicated order just two burgers.,0
"This is by far THE worst McDonalds I have ever been too. They  consistently deliver poorly McDonald service and food  menu item.
They poorly assemble burgers , chicken  sandwiches etc as it always their team members do not care on how McDonald standards are taken.

Depressing & very sad memorial evidencing what happened during the Holocaust period!,0
Worst mcdonald's ever this morning I went inside no cashier they told me to use kiosk to order my food. I ordered and then had to wait 30 minutes this was so crazy and then I asked to speak with a manager and then I had to wait about another 15 min and then no staff members would speak English. They all need an attitude adjustment. I will never ever go to this Mcdonald's again never ever had to wait 45 min for a cup of coffee!!!! Please don't go and spend your money here!!!,0
This place needs more attention and better management employees only do is play around flirt with each other and scream too much and the also have no hat or any hair net on the kitchen staff the only person I saw with a hair net is the cleaning lady,0
"I ordered takeout from the McDonald's app. After waiting at least 20 minutes they finally talked to me and asked about my order. I said that I put my order in through the app. They said that because their system was down they could not give me the food that I paid for. I spent ten dollars and wasted a half hour of my life. I have had to complain to corporate, I have had to talk to a manager via email. Nothing has been done, they don't even want to give me a refund they merely offered me a coupon which they never gave me. It has been months since this had happened and there is still no resolution. If I left a McDonald's with ten dollars worth of food they would have me arrested but because I am a customer they are fine with stealing my money and my time. This is a terrible McDonald's and because of this experience I will no longer be going to any McDonald's in the future.",0
"I love McDonald, so I going to eat my BigMac combo, very good! But the big problem is, very very dirt, dirty tables, dirt coming out of garbage cans, dirt on the ground!  I made a video and now I send it directly to McDonald Company!!! I talk with the manager!!",0

Id give it zero starts if I could. The drive through only had two cars ahead of me to order and in total it took an hour. It took ten minutes no exaggeration at the order board for someone to take my order. When i get to the window he didnt know what i had and literally just then put my order in. It was not that busy at all and it had at least 4 people working. At the window he took my card for about two minutes and i froze my bank account just in case,0

Customer service was terrible! After waiting five minutes just to try and place our order we decided just to drive up to the window to place our order. Once we got to the window the young lady that was suppose to be taking orders for the drive thru was just on her phone texting. The sense of urgency was nonexistent! All we wanted was a large fries and sweet tea ,0

The worst McDonald i came across. Just takes them mire than 20 minutes from order to receive. Hope the building burns down.,0
Was basically out of half the menu. Then we had them repeat back our $56 dollar order to us twice and once we got back to our hotel 2 sandwiches were missing. While paying with my card through the drive thru the cashier said I had to give her my pin number because the pad didn't reach out the window. I've NEVER had something like that happen to me anywhere in my life. Not a single employee had on a uniform. Just a total messed up experience,0
We wait in the line for over 20 min. When we arrive 2 employees were outside the store speaking. The worst drive thru service ever!,0
"Every, time, I, come, here... EVERY TIME!! I don't think I've been able to ever successfully pick up an order from here.. like ever. They either don't have the order, or my pickup gets cancelled because of the wait time... Smh",0

Oh and the fries ... so old and stale they would make a great ",0
"Terrible. In line for over an hour and my whole order was messed up. First they told me over the drive thru intercom that they don't do the coupon on the app then told me to pull around after taking my order. Make matters worse was the one worker kept scratching her hair, her hoody on her head, then take it off and scratch hair again. Not once did she wash her hands, but had the nerve to be mad at me because your coworker didn't ring up the order correctly. Definitely will not be coming back to this one. I'm glad I'm on my way back home to Texas, so I can get some Southern Hospitality.",0
"Not 24 hours, more so when I feel like working especially late night. They sit inside and let a line build up and don't respond to multiple hellos. I don't get it. Customer service does not exist",0
"I never leave reviews but I had to here.

Honestly, if you visited every single McDonalds in the country and ranked them I am convinced this one would be dead last.

I spent an hour in the drive-thru and when I got to the window it took 10 minutes before anyone even came to the window and when they did they had no idea what I had ordered.

I have never seen a group of people move so slowly and with such little purpose or interest  in what they were doing. It seems like they were just annoyed to be working at all. Literally it looked like the whole crew was moving in slow motion, it was a sight to see.

Then when I finally did get my food the order it was, of course, not correct. But the weird thing is they didn short me they gave me an extra quarter pounder and fries.

I am just visiting and will never go there again anyways but ",0
"DO NOT GO! As soon as I got in, I got yell at by one of their employees to get out and go to through the drive thru. I told her I did not have a car and she told me to wait in the line anyways. I standed in the line for cars and they took forever to make any orders. After  my order was done, they made me wait on the sidewalk and let other cars go ahead of me just because I was not in a car. The two cars behind me had bigger orders (I am talking 2/3 delivery bags). They yelled at me, they basically threw the food at me and I left with the worst experience. Is not fast food if you have to wait 30 minutes just to order.",0
They never have anything - Their Menu is always crossed out and when you order something,0
Second time in less than 2.weeks apart. More than 20 minutes waiting in the drive thru because these guys take the wrong orders. A complete disaster.,0
"I move close to this unit, ordered via app to avoid the drive thru line, but for my surprise when I went to get my order that was ready I was forced to take an hour in the drive thru line.

This is supposed to be fast food.

When I went to pick up my order, the drinks were wrong, the potatoes were the wrong size and old, the Sundae machine was broken, they didn't deliver our sundaes and the attendance was super rude, saying that the problem was mine and not hers, burgers were in the correct Double Quarter Ponder box but when we got home, there were cheeseburgers and the third burger wasn in the bag!!

The amount charged on my card by the Mc Donald app was greater than the closing of the order.

I made a complaint to customer service that notified the unit but unfortunately no concrete action will be taken.

Never had a more disappointed experience estaurant again!",0

Her disgusting long fake curly weave was not put up and she kept flinging it around as we watched it dip into many of the drinks.

Health department would have a field day with this Sorry excuse for a worker.",0
They need to shut down this Mc Donald or sell it to a different management. Worst service ever!,0

Cashier at the drive thru window literally handed me my receipt with her head down and other hand texting. Very irritated that I paid for two coffees and it wasn't until I reached my next destination that I realized that they were made completely wrong. Ladies making the coffee were talking and laughing and didn't say hello, or thank you. Very rude.",0

"Do NOT go to this McDonald's if you're in a hurry. We were just picking up a drink so it wasn't a problem but ordering was chaos and there was a guy beside us who had seriously been waiting 35 min for his chicken sandwich. He showed us the receipt showing when he ordered and was trying to ask the staff what was happening and they were quite rude and just said ""man you can see we busy"". Also note that this was the only McDonald's we encountered in Florida that doesn't offer $1 any size soft drinks.",0
"Staff are busy talking and they don't care about customers . And, they make us wait for long time at drive through all the time!
When I called at the store, they picked up the call. But when I start complain about this situations, they hung up on my face!  This McDonald used to be so good and professional.
I don't know what happened.
since they changed to new staff, got worse .",0
"Homeless people walking on  the restaurant, asking for money. Employees ignore it...",0
"Drive thru cashier completely got my order wrong.  She order what she saw on register and not what I wanted.  Then look surprised when I told her.  The manager should not let her work drive thru. Which explains why the line was so long.  I'm sure I'm not the only order she screwed up. Don't normally post these comments,  but it's becoming more of the norm these days.",0
"This McDonald's needs to close. I've ordered 15 times in 6 months and had 1 correct order. Don't order delivery, go yourself, and check the bag before you leave.",0
no stars!!! this is the worst ever service i have ever encountered 28 minutes in the drive-thru. I asked for a refund and the managers name and they refunded me my money and decline to give me the food. I ask the manager for her name and she walks away.... at the end i got my food for free but perhaps a better management team needs to come in and train cus these young women that were there yesterday 6/23 around 2pm were exchanging snapchat videos and chitchatting like they didnt have 8-10 cars in the drive thru,0
Bad costomer service slow workers,0
They have the worst manger ever. One of them have a lack of speaking which is Arlene Ledesma!!!!! She doesn't know what is being said to her. You can't get your point across because she won't understand . Can't handle the  customers and she's very disrespectful.,0
"the slowest mc Donalds in the world!  It is supposed to be 24 hours, but they leave it closed to customers and by car mac it takes 15 minutes per customer.  I mean I wasted 1h of my life waiting for such a bad and slow service",0
more than two hours waiting and I left without the order rude and drugged staff did not even know what they were doing,0
8:50 pm they have the doors locked and won allow anymor,0
The worst person in the world taking orders at the window 12 16 18 at 7:48am with red yarn braids very nasty disposition rude and verbally abusive when I ordered I was cut off no repeat of order no price given so I went to the second window no one was in the first the person was full filing the order with HUGE attitude I stated that no attitude was necessary she proceeded to bark at me as though she was ready to fight me with the whole neck action and more attitude......I will not go back to this location its the second time in 1 week that Ive been there to such treatment. I can not believe that the mngr allows this behavior this can not be the first issue with this person nor can this behavior not be unnoticed......,0
"Almost everything I order was wrong. I order a Sunday with chocolate syrup, and they brought me caramel. I also order and paid extra for bbq sauce, and they didn't put any; the food was also cold!  Worst restaurant!",0
Warning- Check your order every time you come to this location. Guaranteed to be missing an item you ordered. Don let them tell you,0
Cant hate on the workers... its Mcdonalds... just dont go to this location. And good luck trying the drive thru if you have plans in the next 2 hours,0
"They won't mess up your order, but you will sit in the drive through for at least 15 - 20 minutes before you get to order and then wait another 10 minutes to get your food. Overall unless it's your only option, you should drive on to a better run McDonalds.",0
The new order system that takes the food to the table was not working .employees are very disorganized. Talking instead of doing their jobs  my coke spilled because it was poorly lid. I had a terrible experience at this location,0
Worst experience ever stood in line for 10 minutes to order asked when my order would be taken was told the system was down and was given a nasty attitude instead of proper customer service I was treated rudely bad enough the store was filthy fries everywhere on the floor the manager and the young lady was playing around with each other he tickling her on her side instead of fixing the solution I,0
"Avoid this location at night. It's the worst! First the whole staff hates thier jobs and second the wait time for your food is like 30 mins or more, between them doing your order and all the uber eats, postmates and grubhub also waiting to pick up orders. Its a mess. They are understaffed and everything is wrong at this location.",0
"I like the new design but the customer service has gone down hill. Way too many employees go there on their day off to socialize, they hang around the registers distracting emplyees who should be focused on their stations and tending to customers. The worst part is that one of the managers (a young latino kid) was engaged in of these conversations. I asked the manager why he wasn't controlling his staff and he just looked at me and laughed.",0
"What a joke! Parking is awkward, went and asked for breakfast - they were out of muffins. Okay... asked me to wait a few minutes they'll start lunch at 10:30. Come up there at 10:30 on the dot - they tell me they won't serve lunch until 10:45-10:50, because they still have breakfast food left???? I didn't know the cashier's decide when to serve lunch now!",0
"I placed my mobile order, they made me wait 30 minutes in the drive thru before I could get my food, this is a dump! Always a $h!t show there!",0
The worst experience.  Staff and management ignored the customers. Talked to each other.  Took 10 minutes to order.  Then 10 minutes to get my food.  No apology.  Management watched and said nothing during this whole ordeal.  Total rude and unprofessional.,0
"This is the worst Mc. Donalds that I have ever visited. Sadly, this is the only one which is near my home and sometimes I don't have options to chose another one but, today, was the last straw. I made an order through the app and selected the pickup at the Drive Thru but when I got to the screen where we should order, the girl who was there didn't know what to do with my Order Code and when I got to the window and ask for it they didnt know anything neither and they pretended that I went inside because they do not dispatch mobile order by there. Also told me that the payment had not come through and I requested to cancel the order but, 3 minutes later I was charged with the order that I never got so, Im  making this complain because I am pretty upset and disappointed because I always eat in Mc. Donalds but in this store is always the same disgusting and poor service at all time or unless when I have gone: mornings and nights. Also, I disputed the charge you made to my credit card because, as you noticed, I never got it.",0
Went late one night to the drive thru and was told they were closed. I pulled forward and someone was paying for their meal. I thought this was a 24/7 location.,0
"If I could give 0 stars, I would.
Food: not fresh, not the right configuration
Staff: dude handed me an oreo Mcflurry without making sure the cap was on properly and it went all over my car. Asked for a manager and he said there was none.... ok dude, if you say so.
Drive-thru menu: half the screen was off and the drive thru lady could not comprehend that - even as I pulled into the store and told her. She didn't get what was happening.

I can't believe McDonald's would let a franchisee get away with this location's issues.",0
They couldn't even put the cheese on my sandwich properly. Terrible.,0
"The staff doesn understand english
They w",0
"Long wait in drive thru. Ordered double cheeseburger and mcdouble both no onion no mustard and received a dry not even ketchup and with Extra onions... I'm allergic to onions, realized too late to go back. Waste of time and money, trashed-",0
Unfriendly employees! Google said 24/7 - they were impolite and kicked us out before we could order and we were in line,0
"I'll never come back to this McDonald's again. Went by for lunch & when I asked for a refill on my tea when leaving, I was informed that because I didn't buy a combo meal I couldn't get a drink refill. I guess the sandwich I bought didn't count. Tables were dirty too. Their not worth 1 star!",0
"this cashier treats us very badly, nasty attitude he should not work here,",0
"Used drive thru at 12,15 am; finally got my food at 12,45 am. They have two lanes for offering and only one window to dispatch food for those, plus the uber drivers on foot at the window waiting for their orders.

Food was kind of cold, fries and breaded chicken tasted like burned oil and on top of that, they didn't put any mayonnaise or ketchup for the fries.

These big chains have no quality control.
It's actually sad when you compare the food from the picture to what you really get.",0
Extremely slow service.,0
Slow service manager working register and takeout not enough help.,0
Both bathrooms are locked and not functional. No one in the store speaks English.,0
"I have had two bad experiences  with this particular  location , cashiers at drive thru dnt greet customers , and we waited for like five minutes for someone to come back to take our  order , we were told it wasn't any ice cream , but when we came inside there was a customer leaving with ice cream . That's when one of the employees said  quote on quote why yall played  like that . Both incidents ms Taylor whose suppose to be manager could not control her staff , neither could she tell me who was in the drive thru taking my order.  She has no control over that staff !! And clearly does not know how to run her shift!!! Horrible horrible experience when ppl are spending money at this location You guys really need better staff and managers who can run their shifts and not let the employees run over them because clearly that's what's going on at this location  I have reached out to cooperate  once and until this  is solved I'll keep reaching out !!!!",0
The late night service is terrible!!! Waited in line for an hour before I was able to place an order! Someone needs to fix this system or hire new staff.,0

"Bad service in the disgusting place of churre, the supervisors who have to set an example, just gossip and speak ill of the clients, I don't know how the owners do not come as a surprise. There are people who really deserve the job. Hygiene shines. .hand sanitizer empty",0
What a real lack of respect to close the door for customer service before 10 pm between almost 15 minutes before and they told me that the boxes were turned off what a bad service from this establishment the staff are super rude if they don't want to work better don't go ,0
"In the night shift 9 / 10 they are taken as a break because several times I have gone and they say that it is ""closed"", and the service has always been very, extremely slow and late... but it is the one that is close to me and no way , but without a doubt one of the worst in the whole country",0
"It is the third time we go at night and they don't let us in to eat. We always go before 10:00 pm, today we arrived at 10:05 pm and they literally slammed the door in our faces, and on the door it says it's until 11 pm. If you don't have dine in after 10 pm please change your hours on the website and at the door of the place!",0
"the stencion is terrible, 10 people behind the counter and from so much they talk among themselves and laughing the line is very long, too young and arrogant for stencion public, the owner of that franchise should open his eyes a little and clean up the lazy that they do not work",0
"One star is too much
McDonalds very dirty staff useless in every way and I'm not talking about the sandwiches a shame",0
"Horrible experience. Good location, however the structure is terrible and disorganized. I waited almost 40 minutes for my order to be ready. The staff are nice, however the whole service is a mess.",0
"They won't let me put zero stars, that's why I chose one and they don't deserve it. The worst MacDonald in the United States, they are a shame, the bad treatment they give to customers, I was in the second line, 3 cars passed by from the first and they didn't serve me When my turn came, they yelled at me because I ordered in Spanish. I asked to speak to the manager, he told me NO, then my 9-year-old daughter asked for her order in English and told her that she was not going to sell and said a bad word to her...I had I explained to the manager that they called him and in front of her he treated me badly for not speaking English, a very bad attitude from that person... how sad with so many people who need to work, they give work to people without education or respect...",0
"Incomprehensible things come across in the neck, they can open the toilet and all the toilets are closed, you can",0
"They gave me some sundaes with the wrong topping and then they changed them for ones that were almost empty and poorly made... very bad customer service, they didn't even give us an apology....",0
"I don't like it very much, the breads are not like the ones we used to eat at McDonald's, also almost all of them only speak English and sometimes it's hard to communicate",0
Very bad attention they yelled at me just for not understanding my language they should put only English so many of us would not go through such unpleasant moments,0
"To get out of the way it goes well, but the attention is unfriendly, dirty bathrooms. Average food to a MCD.",0
"Dirty place, noisy employees and they took the order wrong",0
"The attention is terrible, a shame they don't care about the customers, they leave the orders adrift, annoying people. The worst in attention avoid this mac donald",0
Worst MacDonald I've ever been to I hope I never go back it's all bad,0
"In: They are sick here they are supposed to be open 24 hours a day but they do not respond to the Drive and the employees who are working indoors do not open the door to customers, so we stay outside I don't necessarily like

Eng: It's sick here they're supposed to be open 24 hours a day but they don't answer the Drive and the employees who are working inside don't open the door to customers, so we stay outside I don't necessarily like",0
"You enter the bathroom and there is no soap to wash, there is no paper to clean yourself. The hamburger is good but they deliver it to you with the black lettuce, which for me is rotten. The fries are potato fries ..... I returned them twice because they taste like oil from 7 days ago ... very low",0
"1 hour waiting!!! And his second drive tru lane was useless! No one indicated anything or put a sign to say that it was useless! Horrible experience, worst Mcdonalds in FL!!! Apart from the zero friendly staff. Never come!",0
No one maintained hygiene standards... the person in charge did not make herself understood with the use of the language either. It was a bad service experience,0
"Terrible service, one hour to buy two cheese burgers and the employees ignore their customers",0
"Of all the stores of the Macdonals chain that I have visited, this is the slowest and without customer service. The lady that they must know that employee by employee number was very abusive with her way of attending, she was very closed in the explanation in the offer that she wanted, she argued that it is not her problem to explain but only to place orders, in mockery that she did not want order would cancel the order.. he fought because his service is like that... as if he was going to give me the order as a gift...",0
"Terrible place, dirty, bad attention, slow. And to top it off, in the middle of summer there are no frozen drinks... with a silly excuse, since it's a business with so much money, don't they have to have several machines if one breaks to replace it?... in a business like McDONALD'S, Do they not have enough staff to apply customer service as it should be?",0
"Very slow, too slow",0
"Because the first time I use this service and they did not bring me 2 ice cream that I ordered and when I called to complain they do not answer or give explanations, and my nephew whenever he orders this service from his phone says that something is always missing and I did not know why If you were like that, I would not ask for this service, now is not the time to vote for money since the work is not good.",0
"The food is good but the service is bad, nobody pays attention to you",0
Horrible experience 1 hour in the drive truck. Don't even think about waiting.,0
"A homeless person with a very bad smell opened it for me, we started off badly and inside there were several homeless people who were staring at our plates... sorry, it was NOT comfortable at all",0
"Terrible staff in general, I have never seen a worse McDonald's in my life. Super slow, 20 minutes on the clock to pay for the order since the payment kiosks did not work, without any order, without priority to attend to the payment, without smiling, they seemed bitter at work.",0
Even the one in So Lus - MA - BR is faster than this one. I spent mor,0
"One of the dirtiest McDonald's I've ever seen. Its exterior and the withdrawal window looks all dirty!!
There is no maintenance at all.!!!
If that is the building, how will the kitchen be?",0
"It wasn't good this time, they gave me a box with melted cheese and I don't know what else instead of 4 chicken nuggets. Eye check your orders well before retiring from the window",0
"Very bad place. Very bad place
The manager has an agreement with tows and takes the cars from customer parking, receives bribes from the tow company.

The manager has an agreement with the car towing company and receives bribes to take them from the customer parking lot.",0
"As an uber driver and delivery person today 29 10 2017 I received a delivery from that place for a client. I stay . At zero battery, but I take a current charger that I had in the car. I went to McDonald's I asked them to let me connect in the corridor to complete my order and they told me no. It couldn't end, I lost time and money, and I'm sorry for the customer and my uber company.",0
"The one who seems to be the manager today, very unprofessional. Everyone talking and playing even physically and the work behind and unattended. Only the cashier did her work, although she also seems to be a manager because she had a shirt with stripes that was different from the others.",0
"The worst experience, seeing how the supervisor denied a homeless person some fries for 25 cents. I am outraged by the lack of sensitivity on the part of the staff and seeing how they laughed at the situation! . The poor man did not go to ask or steal, he wanted to be able to eat with what he had. Shame. I will not go back to that McDonald restaurant.",0
"A rather dirty place, the toilets were filthy.
We waited more than 20min to be served (fast food...)
Far from being the best McDonald's we've had...",0
Whenever I go between 5am and 7am they always tell me the same thing that the system has gone and they don't want to sell. They should improve the attention and for that they should improve the supervision of this store,0
"The worst place, I left because it was impossible to talk to the attendant, because I don't speak English. In other places they make an effort and we understand each other but I think they discriminate against us Hispanics!!",0
"They are very arrogant, I took a coupon, and they gave me three options, I took the cheapest one and they sold me the most expensive one, so why offer me, and they spoke fast in English, so I couldn't understand them and, they could make fun of me",0
"The SLOWEST McDonald's I've ever met, I've never left a bad review on any restaurant AND I consider myself a person with incredible patience, but everything has its limit.",0
I made an order through Uber eat and it took more than 1 hour and in the end I canceled the order because they never prepared it,0
The place is very good but the manager has very bad treatment with customers,0
Very slow and bad service,0
"Very bad service, the staff does not make an effort to do a good job, first they wanted to charge me for an additional hamburger, then they gave me a big Mac in another cover",0
Very bad service! The person who served me was terrible! I do not recommend it!,0
"Virtually the entire store was uncleaned, the disgusting bathrooms, the uncleaned tables, the floor with the rest of the food, the super slow service (lack of staff), much to be desired",0
"It is not 24 hours they should update it, 00:06 at night on a Saturday and they did not want to serve us while we were inside because they closed",0
I ordered an order online I went to look for it and I had to leave due to the delay they had all the doors closed,0

Terrible!,0
"Terrible service, it's supposed to be fast food and at dawn it takes 1 hour at the drive thru",0
Rare bustling place to eat in this part of Bay Side on Byscayne Boulevard. Lack of better between 3 skyscrapers!,0
"The place looks impressive, but it is not what it seems and it is not very high quality.",0
"The worst service. The staff is rude, the food takes time to be served. I do not recommend it at all. One of the worst McDonald's I've been to.",0
Zero hygiene,0
It's like any McDonald's except that the service was lousy... With rude employees and they gave us everything cold.,0
"Bad attention, bad attitude and terrible service. In conclusion they should change all the staff",0
"Bad service, not friendly. They gave me the potatoes in half and without salt and when I made the claim they refused to change them",0
"The worst McDonald's! The attention is terrible, they do not dispatch quickly, it is always the same. They should pay more attention to this venue, really!",0
They overcharged me and my order was not the one they delivered to me. Making me waste more time than I should. What a crap this service,0
Bad service and bad taste. Wouldn't go back there!,0
1 hour for two hamburgers,0
"It closed at 11:45 p.m. and they wouldn't let us in, incredible by force, and with the help of people who complained while inside, we were able to enter badly",0
"Very bad service, very hard bread, very poorly made ice cream, an unrecommended place",0
"The manager of this place is arrogant and arrogant
He also has business with him, I saw how he insulted a client and on top of that he humiliates him, it's bad",0
"Very bad service, too much, very slow are the workers",0
I went at 5am on Sunday and it was closed. A lie,0
"Good evening. Completely disorganized staff speaking very loudly in Haitian Creole
The wait was very long.",0
Slow and rude service. After Checkers the worst place in Miami.,0
"Very, very time consuming to deliver the snacks.",0

My mc. Crispy chicken sandwich was  customer service was quick and p,1
"I'm not really a huge fan of fast food, but I have 2 teenage daughter's who enjoy McDs. The staff here is always friendly and ALWAYS get their orders correct. By far one of the best McDs I have ever been to. I always enjoy and appreciate quality service from quality people... and you'll definitely find it here. At least from the evening crew. Haven't been here during the day. My girls joke that I go here so often to get them food, that the staff is going to end up knowing me and having their order ready to go. Lmao Great people and excellent service. 占쏙",1
"The line wS extremely big and was moving very slowly, plus they were out of apple pies and strawberry cream pies, but they gave me substitute cinnabun, the staff was very apologetic for being slow & they were out of pies, but it was middle of the night and they were extremely under-staffed.",1
The staff seems to always be different which makes ordering sometimes a little difficult because they are in a state of perpetual learning which can also lead to waiting a bit longer but the lobby is always clean as well as the bathrooms,1
With all the new upgrades everything looks great and clean great staff,1
The staff are very friendly and they do their job perfectly,1
Awesome service! Food hot!  Best ever,1
"Been frequenting this location for a few years.Morning,mid-day and night,the food is always hot,fresh and served with a smile.",1
Good quick drive through service.  Was a long line but went very quickly.,1
I go here all the time. Great staff.. NVR get my food wrong it's just always a line wrapped around lol that's why they ain't 5 stars. Most def customer service is better then the food but hey I just go for my kids because they love it so why not! Good customer service guys! Makes all the difference,1
"OPEN 24HRS all the darn time!!  If there are 24 hours in every day and then 7 days in a week then that means this place is open eleventeen million hours a year.  I dont even know how they find people to work here I mean how do they shower or brush their teeth or change clothes if they are always there.... I think I may have an idea: they are robots.  Or clones, like this example that's Dolly the sheep she's pretty hot NGL.",1
"It was late, order was wrong, person taking order needs to slow down,",1
"Never gotten my order wrong, employees seem to change a lot but they're consistently quick and nice. Also the prices here are lower than other locations, I don't know why but its a total welcome change haha.",1
"Service is slow, but I get all of my items with no errors and it's a bit smaller than most locations. Overall, it's a good place to grab a quick bite near Lake Creek.",1
"The cashier's are very nice. Its very clean on the inside, and they get your food done fast",1
Manager waited on me. He went out of his way to make me a satisfied customer.  Great customer service!,1
"I would have given 5 stars, the evening manager is the nicest person I have seen and is definitely in charge of training her crew with constantly new help, in spite of this, everytime I have to return an order she goes back to the kitchen and patiently disassembles the sandwich and explains the proper way to make the sandwich in a spirit of education and with a cherry disposition. You can tell the children she works with respect her and look up to her, and yes, they might get things confused occasionally but I will continue to go there. 4 out of 5 stars",1
"The staff is very kind and the food is usually prepared in a timely manner, for this reason it'sone of my preferred location's. However the drive thru line can sometimes be an inconvenience as it can get very long and at times even block entrances.",1
"Hashbrowns were fire today.

Frappes always on point and the machine is always working.

Always get me to work on time with fast workers",1
Allways has the best Fries and Ice cream in the world!,1
Mcdonalds is great but they really need to hire people who understand both english and spanish and not just spanish speakers trying to take english orders. The people are really nice but be smarter about who you put in the drive thru and lobby to take orders.,1
I love going to McDonald's in that area because that's where I get most of my food for my family and my grandchildren and they love me when I bring stuff to him like every couple days so it's great to go to that McDonald's McDonald's is a good spot for taking my grandkids and buy him food there are the greatest thing that they're right off of lake Creek thank you for putting it there,1
Love the price  French fries,1
Food was good atmosphere was ok restaurant was clean. Only thing from making it a 5 I almost ate it on the floor. Wet sign was present but it was beyond slick. Otherwise good quick place to grab a bite.,1
"Compared to other Macdonald's locations, this is consistently the best. Polite, fast and overwhelming accurate on the orders. I've been going to this location for a while, never had a bad experience at the drive thru. Great staff!",1
"I like this location. It's my dogs favourite for unsalted fries, so I have to give them five stars. Great crew - fast, well groomed, friendly.",1
Much cleaner after the renovations and the quality of food for a mcdonalds is better as well. The staff has been relatively friendly and with the new atmosphere im more likely to eat inside rather than the drive thru.,1
"EDIT: Recently this McDonald's had been improving a lot, especial when compared to other McDonald's in the area (maybe the one on North part of W. Parmer, but not really fair comparison, I mean That one has a god-damn waterfall....). Keep up the good work! +1 Star

OLD: They took out all the power outlets and a table was just left broken covered with caution tape. Always understaffed and you can tell the owners are sucking this place for every penny without putting anything back in. Gives family owned McDonald's a bad name.",1
Good place,1
"Look, it is good food for the money. It is fast food people, but I will rather go to McDonald's than all the other fast food burger places. Fries are off the chain everytime, honestly.
Craving one as we speak!",1
Understand McDonald's is under construction but it is doing well with its Service as it's going right now I still recommend going to McDonald's is still fast service and still great awesome food and the kids love it still so as soon as they're done with the remodeling as soon as they are they are they're all right all day all ready to go back to work I recommend this in my community and Community sure does love this and Leander Texas,1
Live nearby and this is our choice McDonald's compared to others in close distance. I gotta say though that the last order of fries I got really were so yucky I chewed on 2 and didnt eat the rest. They tasted over cooked or double cooked. Something made them rubbery and inedible to me.,1
Always have had a positive experience.  Arthur who took my order was beyond professional and friendly and made my last visit exceptional!  I will be back!,1
"The food was fresh, tasty and fabulous! Great service as well. Thank you!",1
"This store has a friendly smiling staff. It is clean. And most of the time the orders are correct and when they aren't the management makes it right. Convenient, easy, quick.",1
This has got to be the cleanest and friendliest McDonald's That we have ever been to. The service was fast and friendly. I highly recommend this fast food restaurant at this location.,1
"Everytime i go there i order the same thing and this has been a routine of mines for four years i get two egg and cheese mcgriddle large fries and a large sweet tea and every time they put meat on my mcgriddle when i clearly don't ask for any, other then that they are good and fast",1
I just enjoy their all day breakfast! And yes Senoirs recieve a coffee discount..must ask! Mcmuffins  are always HOT! GREAT SERVICE..CLEAN ENVIRONMENT...BON APPITET,1
It's always good to get some food fast going through the drive-thur. I was in and out in less than 5 mins.,1
"As part of Lake Creek Festival Mall review McDonald's is featured as a member of the Mall and as Contributing Member of Our Anderson Mill Community.

Peace ",1
The girls on the weekday morning shift ptovide the fastest drive thru service in the world!  And the order us always accurate. They can serve almost a dozen vehicles in the time it takes Whataburger to serve one.,1
"There service was good, but don't order a med water they charge.I ask and she said anything bigger than a small they do charge,  well all they had to do is tell me before I pay and give me a choice!",1
"Had a stellar McD's Quarter Pounder w/ Cheese & Fries. Yes, really! Delicious, hot, and so good!",1
Go everyday for my morning breakfast before work. Staff is nice and if I ever had a error with my to go order the manager has made it right.,1

"Not worth the effort to get in and out of construction to wait for old food.
Only went there twice. The food is never fresh.  Chicken sandwich was shriveled and dry like it had been sitting for hours after being over cooked to begin with. There was a small drop of mayo on it and the bun was stale. First time I figured was a one off but the second time I ordered 20 nuggets and fries and a milkshake.  They didn't give a receipt then told me to go park to wait for the food to be ready.  There were no spots open that I could access and the cashier just said 'do whatever' and walked away.  I waited for the car in front of me to move so I could pull around the building and get into a spot but asked first about my shake.  She said they'll bring it.  Waited a few min honestly not long but then they forgot my milkshake and asked me very curtly 'well do you have a receipt? ' clearly not.  Eventually they brought out the shake but fries were old and cold and the shake was melted.",1
"I used the drive thru today.
It was quick.
Free off street parking lot.
Building was clean and well maintained.
To pay the clerk put the card reader outside so I could put my own card in the machine.
Safe I guess?
Food was typical McDonald's food. Good
Warm. Not Hot.
Had #9 Large with a Diet Coke.
2 Cheeseburgers and FF
And a LG Soda.",1
Location was clean and modern. Staff were frienldy and efficient. What stood out here the most was the quality of the food preparation. It was almost as if I made it myself and it tasted great. Prices were good too. Highly recommend.,1
Very clean place. Pleasant to be there. I noticed that meat quality could be better.,1
Very clean and polite people here. They did mix up my pie order but was refunded .,1
Fast and always get the orders right. All you can ask for.,1
"We grab late night on occasion Fries always hot and and fresh.
Maybe we are just lucky.
Could be a little warmer inside.",1
"Manager went out of her way during a rush to get apple pies in and out for my kids, exception service.",1
"We had a issue with a missing item on our previous order, When we went back to the Store- the Manager Lucas took care of it and was very polite and provided the best customer service. If you have an issue ask for Lucas, he is a good Manager . Thank you",1
"Haven't ate McDonald's in 3 years, got a breakfast sandwich and I must say thanks for switching the egg and the crispy bacon, they listened to me and did what I wanted! I'm impressed.",1
"I Honestly can not believe that I am going to give the McDonald's in Brodheadsville five/5 STARS!!!!
They deserve it they have proven it to us over and over again..  The New Manager (wish I knew her name) has taken this location from a zero/0 stars to getting a rating of Five/5 Stars and I know that it could not have been easy. I have picked up dinner her once a week for 8-9 weeks in a row and the FOOD has been great.  Thats a lot considering its a McDonald's. My food when I picked it up was always hot, all the food was there correctly. Everything was well made and put together.  You can tell the new manager has set the standards extremely high at this location and the employees have responded extremely well for her. She deserves a big hand for caring about her staff and customers.
Thank You for Caring.......
Great job!!   Well done!!!!!",1
Great place to eat friendly staff,1
"The most recent time was great! Fries were hot n crispy. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I'm still thinking about the Time before last, the fries were cold right out the gate.",1
"Was able to get dinner in just under 9 minutes from the moment I entered the drive-thru line that was lined up almost to 209 to the moment I was pulling away from the window with my food. My order was accurate, warm, neat, and tasty. The staff were quite pleasant to deal with and very calm, despite the massive dinner rush.",1
"Food was hot, prepared properly and delicious. The employees were all helpful and kind. Place was also very clean.",1
This McDonald's in wind gap has a manager who cares about the customer and about placing a good product out for the customer. The staff there is always friendly and helpful. They also make sure you get your burger how you want it and stacked properly so you can eat it without a big mess in your hands and let's not forget about the hot fries. I have heard her tell her employees to make sure people get hot fries. Nobody does that except for her.  That's why this is the best McDonald's.,1
"1st let me apologize for butchering the spelling... but Jamizia has this place on lock! Been in twice recently and usually have a difficult order due to picky kids. Both times she made sure my order was perfect! An i still had my order by the time i was done getting drinks! Her management is on point! She was keeping the flow going, directing staff, and made sure all her guest were taken care of promptly! Highly recommend this location!",1
Quick bit fare price come by,1
"Nice, clean, and friendly. The cashier was knowledgeable and patient especially when people could not make up their minds on their food choices.  The food seems better than most McDonald's but not by much.",1
"This is our hometown MCdonalds and between the wife, grandchildren and I we are here twice a week.  Like review I did on the Hamlin MCDonalds, I call this the older style and it's been [ainted over the years and they removed the small playyard it had.  People now are a afraid of ballpits and it was outside so it didn't get used over 6 months of the year.

There is ample seating, but I've seen more with more seating, but we've never been without finding a seat.  Everything is pretty clean and in good order. Walk-in orders are accurate and fast.  Drive in is fast and about 8 times out of 10 they will have it exact.  Some times they get it wrong, but like we say nobody's perfect.

Since it's right on Rt209 it's easy to get in and out of unless your traveling South on 209 then sometimes it's hard to pull out because there's KFC and Subway and an Ice Cream shop across the street so it's a busy little area in Brodheadsville.  Overall it's a nice facility.",1
"Wind Gap, PA location was surprisingly better during COVID 19 because with the interior closed, the drive up was fast and serving fresh food.
The streamlined way allows  serving just the drive up and so, the kitchen staff cooks food for just one area. Probably saves on staff hours.
Just crave those FRIES once in awhile.",1
"My son and I come to this McDonald's about once a month. It's usually pretty clean here, with the exception of a dirty table now and then. That just means they didn't get out there yet! On this trip...our food was great, but there was this little chubby kid who was left st the table with his 2 way young siblings. He was loud and walking the baby and stressing me out! I have him the EVIL EYE!! Hahahaha anyway the food is always good here, bathrooms have always been pretty clean here too.
It's normally fairly quiet here and lots of high school kids in and out. Chubby kid just enhanced our visit!!",1
Food was good  hot a d order was right staff was friendly,1
"Got the 20 peice mc chicken nuggets and a large fry. The nuggets we're fine, but the Fry's we're stale and that made me sad. The fries can be the best part of the meal. I know that I could have and should have returned them... But I didn't.",1
"Food was very fast, fresh, and hot.  The whole place was packed.  Very clean.  I was impressed.  I ordered and they called my number before I even walked over to get my drink .  I used the bathroom before I left and it was even clean.",1
"Always consistantly good food at a good price. I like the breakfast choices. The fries are the best of any fast food restaurant period. I've read articles, how they selectively choose and then sign contracts with potato farmers to insure the quality and taste is maintained throught all the locations. I wish they would deep fry the apple pies as they did years ago, they were the best when fried. Good service, always have the food choices in stock. clean seating area, kitchen, and bathrooms Enjoy.",1
Nice to sit inside after 2years. The tables didn't look sanitized after people had eaten  I could see grease and crumbs left behind  Also very disappointed they have no salads,1
Evening shift gave us warm fresh food.Surroundings/parking lot was Very clean. To top it off we got a super great Window person.,1
"They are very polite, quick and the food is good.",1
"My Son works here, so of course customer service, and the cooking of food items is outstanding ",1
I went through the drive-through or two chicken nuggets and a root beer with no ice the chicken nuggets with ice cold and the rupiah had a double lid on it and when I drink it spilled about a third of it on my shirt it wasn't properly put in place,1
"Pretty good food, I always get mcflurries, they never have a broken machine and if they do I've never had an encounter with it.",1
Staff was great food was  a little  old but what do expect from mcdonalds? This is why we don't eat there often.,1
Ppl are great. They take pride in their workand they get special orders correct. Always pleasant. You can never get tired of kind and friendly service and they are open 24hrs. Yay to McDonald's!,1
construction out front makes it difficult to get in and out,1
The staff delivered the best customer service anyone could ever ask for. The environment was very clean.Fast check out. Good job guys.,1
"To McDonald's which has changed drastically for the better. You can have breakfast all day long. Breakfast very large for onky $6 something had scrambked eggs, hash brown sausage patty , biscuit and 3 pancakes. New Quarter Pounder has been made up differently with lettuce and tomato now. Still a great place to go low costs and good quality.",1
Great experience good food good staff that are usually pretty patient with the nonsense,1

Very good just stopped in withe the kids for a little ice cream. Nice staff and place was very clean,1
"great food and service, but i have to stop forgetting to never get the shakes here because they taste like soap",1
This McDonald's must still cook their burgers on grill which taste better the others I believed went to hot air fryers uck,1
"Went late night, about 7 cars ahead of me but it went quickly.  Thank goodness that something was still open",1
Only place for miles with a restroom that alone demands a 5 Star rating. Aside from that it's your typical McDonalds.,1
Last order of the night and the food was not stale and the staff were still polite and welcoming,1
"Fast friendly service.  Pipping hot, great tasting coffee at a FANTASTIC PRICE",1
Clean and peaceful place to get breakfast.,1
Clean bathroom clean tables. Mobile order came out in 2 mins (off peak),1
"Food is always good,fresh, and fast .",1

This location is always running no matter what time or day. The food is always fresh and the service is usually fast. If they ever mess your order up they usually do right by you and give you a fresh new order. This location was renovated recently so everything is brand new. They no longer have the children's play area but it's much more of a sit in restaurant style McDonald's.,1
"Our visit was on Friday, 5/12/2023. There is a marked improvement in the service and cleanliness at this location on Ft. Hamilton Parkway. Katherine, the Manager, and her staff (Chris) promptly offered help and solutions to my family's needs. The use of a dedicated staff member to continuously clean the dining area was a big plus. I only feel that the beverage station should be closer to the dining area to facilitate the transfer of drinks from station to table; particularly for the disabled.
Another, concern was the price of the food. Though there were ""dollar"" options available, the price of the more popular sizes and items was very high. A median-income family of four would be wary of dining more than once a month, if that often.
The name of the counter person that helped us during our visit was Chris. He is a credit to the McDonalds company.",1
"I get my combo meal once a week as a treat. Food, service, parking is good. The place can get packed at certain  time of the day, but have a bit of patients .U will meet rude customers once in a while .Good job to all those employees for their hard work to serve everyone whether its drive thru, dine in, take out, deliveries , curb side pick up etc .Its just my opinion and experience with them .",1
I don't know why they every night whatever they like to close the dining room  No time to control it But on the door have a sign showed dinning room open 24 hours And still using the garbage can to block the door,1
"My daughter and I had a very nice experience here. Upon entering, a worker directed us to the order kiosk and inputted the order for us. Then had it delivered to our table!

Don",1
"Food are ok(typically mc), service are good but They don't allow scooter get in.",1
Been coming to this mcdees since 1988 when they had a hamburgler jail and a big yellow slide out in the open. But lately they've had a hard time getting orders right.,1
Here's the flag they currently fly (June 2023) to honor our brothers and sisters who lost their lives defending us.,1
Mmmm to be honest they are pretty fast with their drive-by  orders I cannot complain but they run out of the special items and Frappuccinos pretty fast. Overall food quality is pretty much always fresh!,1
"They have good people working here. The workers won't just let you stand there waiting. They always see people standing there and ask ""what is your order number?"" and then go look for it. For super fast service DL the mobile app and order/pay online.",1
"Is this close to a school? Lots of noisy teenagers hanging around here. Other than that it has an interesting seating arrangement. Just come at a slower time if you plan to enjoy your meal/snack dining in. I do notice the regular pricing is higher than nearby McDonald's. There is lots of curbside pickup parking, drive thru often busy. Ask for ketchup and sauce, they never give it by default.",1
Great staff members clean and little wait time,1
Fast and clean. Good parking and area. Why not.,1
"Easy to pick up my mobile orders. They have soda machines so you don't have to worry about specifying no ice in drinks. They include napkins, straw, and lids. Straws have either been paper or plastic. They do not include ketchup packets, so you have to ask counterstaff. $1 drinks is a perk that no other fast food restaurant has. The dining room has plentiful tables and chairs too, ranging from booths to high stools to couch-like chairs. Easy to get there by Q25 or Q34. Not very close to any subway stations.",1
Food was hot.  Service was fast and pleasant.,1
"The regular parking spots were taken, but there was ample mobile order curbside service parking. I'd never ordered that way before, but it was for take out anyway. An employee delivered the food within 5 minutes of placing the order. Overall it was a good experience.",1
I used the curb side feature. It's excellent,1
"The food was top notch and very enjoyable, the inside of the place is above average in size and variety if seats and tables. Customer service was amazing and the place has multiple places to order in their drive through for multiple people at once.",1
"Place was busy..no chasier at the time. Just had to order in the kiosk or through the app. I ordered on my phone through the app and I got taken care of in a reasonable time. People who ordered on the kiosk and couldn't pay by card, had to wait for someone to collect the money at the cashier. With all the chaos, I want to say the team was handling it. Download the app on your phone and service will be faster. Also, the app does offer deals and free stuff with purchase.",1
Best mcdonalds in the area but for some reason they charge a few cents more. Not a big deal but just something I noticed. The staff makes fries fresh forreal lol upon request. Nuggs are Hit or miss. But burgers are pretty good. Not a fan of the chicken products from here but the other mcodnalds on 86th and 20 has good chicken,1
Just the right amount of salt and fat  to raise my blood pressure and help clog my arteries.,1
The food was amazing I love it I mean the lady who was cleaning was being rude but besides that it was great,1
"The place seems cool, actually isn bad as other M",1
Pretty good. About what you expect from a McDonald's ,1
After renovation this place has become one of the newer McDonalds around. Things have also gotten busier but that means fresher food.,1
Staffs are good.good service.,1
"Stopped by on my way to work... Very fast, drink was made well and food was food lol I appreciated their prompt service",1
"Pretty average McDonald's, the seating is nice, the service is also quite fast. The food is pretty average. It does get crowded sometimes, so I suggest that you go there knowing what you want so that it's a bit easier for the employees.",1
"Very fast, clean and good service.",1
Fast and efficient service...The food is always fresh,1
Always service with a smile! It makes my day to see the smiles of the star who great me at the drive thru windows.  And yes you can see the smiling behind the masks.,1
"Got BOGO Quarter Pounders during my break, service was quick and the burgers tasted really good. Added some extra toppings and the amount was perfect.",1
"Service is incredibly fast. Just done with the register, not yet put back my wallet in pocket and my order is ready.  Workers are pleasant, patience and with no attitude mostly.  What I like most about it is that they do not impose any unnecessary rules and restrictions on people there plus incredibly pleasant and open minded with people from various backgrounds.  This the best McDonald's in the area I have seen.",1
"Seems like a new McDonald's, my first time here. Got my food really quick. They have the high tech screen ordering and mobile ordering. Very big parking lot and drive thru windows. My food came out hot and tasted great. I hate getting cold fries. I was given fries right out of the fryer.",1
"Been there since yesterday, and the place looks fairly nice after it's been renovated

Rating: 10/10",1
"This has probably been the best Mcy D's I have ever been in 10 years. I really don't eat McDonald's much but I'm glad I did today. The staff were super professional, sweet, and down to earth. The food was hot, not barely warm, but Hot. Thank you guys ",1
Excellent food and service. I always go for the specials and they never disappoint. Gnocchi was delicious. The outdoor section is really pretty. And the bread on the table is a great combination. I always end up with lunch the next day especially with the pasta dishes.,1
"My son and I love coming here. Amazing staff, food is great, and the new renovations look great. A shout out to Nick who works here.. thank you again for smiling and making my son feel very welcome.",1
Mic Ribby was smacking. Atmosphere was a 'lil lackin'. Service? It was slappin'.,1
Very friendly fast service,1
"Newly renovated! They have added extra drive thru lanes. LOL! I think we waited longer to get food. The fish sandwich was good, but fries tasted like yesterday's!",1
"Thanks for the kind nice Ashton!!!
U r the best guy help me a lot during the midnight~",1
"Still unable to eat inside , now yo set your order on the screen yourself , I like it that  way , so I have no problem .
The girls were very helpful and friendly handing out the order .",1
It was used to be one of very convenient McDonald stores. No dine-in services and no restrooms make things difficult for everyone. I can't imagine how every place is going to ,1
"TLDR: You can get the BTS meal here - two sauces and special bag included.

Never thought I'd be writing a review for a McDonald's, yet here we are. Was disappointed to hear that the purple packaging isn't available in the U.S. (@Corporate: missed opportunity!). Hesitant because the paper bag adorned with the BTS logo was not guaranteed to be available at all locations. Fears were quelled, as I saw other guests sitting outside, and the elusive BTS paper bag going for $70+ on eBay was elusive no longer. Utilized the self-service machines to order - quick and easy. Medium and large sizes available (opted for medium, which was more than enough food in hindsight). Liked the Cajun sauce more than the Sweet Chili sauce, but just a personal preference. Total of the medium BTS meal was $8.39 + 0.74 tax = $9.13. Food was nothing special; just happy to support the boys.

As always, please be kind to food service workers.

Borahae! 占쏙",1
"Recently renovated. Food tastes fresh and before the pandemic shutdown, the place was spotless. Offers 2 drive through order lanes for speedy purchases.",1
"Good local fast food service, located in the neighborhood at 73rd Avenue & Kissena Boulevard. People are always friendly, whether you eat in or take out. So pickup from sausage on a biscuit, pancakes with or without sausage, burgers, apple pie, coffee or fountain soda, at times has special promotions, nice variety menu.  They do have a kids room for parties,  Large parking lot or drive order menu board then drive up window and pay.  Opens early to late.",1
"This particular drive through is nice and fast. Its easy to get a Big Mac, fries and a coke in less than 5 minutes. Staff is also very helpful all around. This is one of the faster drive throughs in Queens or indeed the five boroughs.",1
"Went to the location on 73rd and Kissena Blvd. last night for the first time since the renovation.  It was a very nice experience.  The renovations was nice but most of all, the staff was so very pleasant and could not have been more helpful.  Such lovely people.  Thank you.",1
"Place is spacious, clean, had parking, and 2 bathrooms.  But when I went they had no Automated teller machines, and only one Human Cashier during a busy time of day.  Completely inadequate.",1
"This is my local McDonald's for the past 25 years. The owner/manager is always around keeping her staff ready to take the next order and pleasantly. The food is served as expected which is hot and delicious and the appearance of the store is upkept and maintained well. Drive thru cashiers could all improve on listening well and confirming orders. A smile goes a long way especially when they made a simple #2, large w/ coke to be complicated. After 25 years of coming to this McDonald's, I leave happy til next time!",1
There's a asian worker that like to help people with McDonald's kiosks order if you want to learn and make your order more faster by yourself ,1
"They're really quick most days. Have no issues redeeming offers from the app. If the QR code doesn't scan, they still take care of it. Kudos!",1
"Food was the usual fare, but the ordering process needs work. Asks for Table Number, but do not explain that you need to take a sign to ID your table.",1
"This seems like a new building. But better than that is the super friendly staff! Every employee with whom we spoke was super nice, polite, helpful and smiling! Highly recommend this McDonalds!",1
"Good place for a quick lunch or snacks
They have so many things  to choose.",1
They renovated this McDonald's and it's huge now. It's still McDonald's but faster drive thru. Still open 24/7 and a good place to satisfy your McCravings,1
"Value 4/5
Taste 4/5
Service 3/5
Presentation of food 4/5
Appearance of the establishment 4/5",1
"Everything was fine, but once i ordered on app and chose drice thru to pick up. The employee was really impatient and sighed.",1
Upgraded but you have to double check your order as they will not give you ketchup or sauces unless asked  & still they will forget,1
As soon as I walked into this establishment I was greeted with friendly staff and a short line to wait on. The cashier Nia helped me pick out exactly what I wanted because I was indecisive and her recommendations really did help. Thank you once again and this is very rare to find a McDonalds as nice as this one,1
Pretty big store and a lot of tables to feel comfortable,1
By far this is the best Mcdonalds in Queens and Brooklyn. The staff and service is well put together. The food is always hot not like the other Mcdonalds. I've been here a few times awesome.,1
The employee directing people to use the kiosk was very helpful and I would have posted pictures but it was so good,1
"A couple of edp's in here but the staff was friendly.
Staff is out of control today.manager yelling at everybody.nothing is going right.3/21/17
1/4/18 Amazing to see so many employees made it to work in this Blizzard today and seem happy.Good job!!",1
Food is always great but you have be careful with the drive through.  They've forgotten things on my order a few times.,1
It's better than most McDonald's I've been to. Quick service and the food is well prepared. Can't really ask for more.,1
"A nice place with good service. Coffee is hot and fresh and better than Starbucks! .  Get there early and it is a relaxing way to start the day.
McDonald's is classic American.",1
Staff went out of their way to help. Food was good and hot.,1
I've only been here late nights so far but service has always been prompt. The workers are great and work efficiently despite all the people that come here.,1
Many people don have the time but just go on the drive thru and you will have great time cuz you speak to 3 people one takes your order one says the price and one gives you your order so if one is not being wat you,1
"What i most like from this McDonald's is the ground play, I took my nice an nephew and they got a good fun day, there is table inside the play area so you can eat and watch closely your kids...
Really loved this place.",1
"The gentleman that was working there that afternoon was very helpful and friendly, thank you so much! You should be manager",1
"Ordered via the app and received the food quickly. Fast service, clean and the food was fresh even though we went at peak lunchtime.",1
I had a good experience at my nearby McDonald's. I got a breakfast. Everything went well.,1
Just the average Mc Donalds nothing special. has clean bathrooms and is near a lot of other stores to shop at. A fun place to visit in general I guess.,1
"Gotta say...this is the best McDonalds around.  Drive thru is quick, and if you ask for ketchup or dipping sauce, they give you more than one.

Open 24 hrs, you can't beat that!",1
Clean and friendly! But don't order Uber Eats the food was cold! And they took longer then expected. I hate that waiting and waiting! 25 minutes late that's just not good service.,1
"Why would anyone hate McDonald's?::::::coffee is inexpensive,oatmeal with fruits my favorite ::::I have only eaten fish sandwich with lettuce and tomatoes::::::::::my preference is whole grain bread however it is not on the menu",1
"They totally redid the store, modernized and bright. The order kiosks help you customize orders and service is very fast.",1
"If you order at the kiosk, they'll bring the food to your table.",1
Very good,1
Great workers!,1
Love this place is nice and clean the people that work there are so nice and polite they also bring your order to the table great place ,1
Sweet tea Sausage Biscutt $2.48 tasty filling and really cheap breakfast leave it to Micky D's to set the Bar High!!!,1
"Very clean, love the new burgers, the the eating atmosphere. But McDonald's and my diet is just a once a month affair. Lol.",1
The usual McDonald's good drunk food. Crowed in drive thru service still pretty quick. Price went up a little not much still good deals,1
The Food Here Is Great The Butter Milk Tenders Is To Absolute Die For The Wait Is Not Very Long And The Staff Are Nice. Great Fast Food Place And I Hope It Succeeds,1
Professional and speedy staff. Tbh I don't eat here. Was at the drive thru for someone I was hanging out with at the time.,1
Excellent service and food...,1
"The food was very fresh. Although one man short, however they pulled it off. Amazing!",1
This place is very nice and clean. Most of the staff members are very friendly and has smile on them most of the time. Would repeat,1

"I used to eat here when my kids were little because there is a play area just for kids. Now the playground has been dismantled and redecorated, adding seats designed for the elderly, two extra-long tables, and a self-service ordering screen. The outdoor parking lot has also added a self-ordering place, and you can scan the QR code with your mobile phone or download the APP to complete the order.",1
The good thing is to take away because to eat there you refuse,1
A very cool place to share with the family,1
Excellent service ,1
"I love this McDonald's location for its easy access in Flushing, NY.
Especially since the staff is very professional and respectful, and I must mention that they can serve customers in different languages, including Spanish.",1
"I don't go there often, the fast food is simple and convenient, and occasionally there are big discounts, so I need to download the app. The environment is average.",1
"Not long after the renovation, it is very clean and the service is very good. I remember it well.",1
All good,1

"Very good food, Very nice workers, the place is looking good. Go there and enjoy",1
I gave it 4 stars because this McDonald's is very clean staff are very nice respectful tends to ur needs if their is some.They have a second fl. Where the bathroom r clean also inspire the crowd.I come in early because is quite if u need a place to work or homework. Actually there is a third floor also very spacious.,1
"Very nice and clean, kiosk booths are user friendly for ordering and paying for your food. Just watch out for folks soliciting you for any spare change. And they be touchy. Not cool.",1
My experience was awesome like fact that is clean and futuristic. Will definitely come again when I'm around.,1
"It's an okay place. If you need somewhere to take the weight of your feet, this is a good place.",1
It is very clean McDonalds. And stuff is very pleasant) we ordered French fries. so great,1
"Busy, so busy, it's hard to know when your foods ready if tour not standing up there the whole time. But is across from Pen Station, given the area and associated expectations of large crowds of people,  service was good.",1
Employees were friendly and courteous. Quick service and food was fresh.,1
"Well staffed on the weekend. Clean and efficient service. Food is prepped on 2nd floor and ride conveyor down to be bagged. I don't like the idea of not being able to glimpse food preparation operation. However, service is good. Food tastes as expected. Standard, nothing special. Kind of small space. Fine to satisfy immediate hunger.",1
"This McDonald's is pretty okay, but at night junkies tend to wander around this area. Obviously not the restaurant's fault though it's worth noting. I always do app orders, and haven't had any issues in the past year or however long. The wait seems normal to me. I definitely prefer this location to the larger one on 8th Ave.",1
It was good. There was a mistake on my order it was fixed no problem. The machines were having some problems and this made the lines a little long. But it was fine.,1
Great service and very clean. Staff is working hard. Enjoyed the visit.,1
people who take the time to review mcdonalds and give negative reviews need to get a life,1
Hot fresh food definitely recommend 34th 7ave McDonald's ,1
"It's fast food, what can I say!",1
Little but fast,1
"Staff is very quick, efficient, and friendly here... never had an incorrect order before.

Side note,  I'm not sure of his name but thank you thank you thank you so much to the security guard that works here for returning my phone to me after it was just stolen along with everything else in my bag. Went that extra bit that is much more rarely seen these days... and getting that phone back meant so much more than he could've ever known- so once again,  THANK YOUUUUUU!! 占쏙",1
"I Rarely frequent McDonald's as a brand, but your beautifully remodeled location diagonal from Penn Station is the ONLY place you can get ice coffee and a breakfast sandwich at 5:30 in the morning! The staff that was on the first time I went where pleaser and efficient. The second time I went,I had to use the kiosk,which frustrated me ( I rather interact with humans) A young lady from the back came out to help me place my order,and I was an appreciative and satisfied customer that morning!",1
"Although this particular McDonald's is located in the heart of Manhattan, the service was very friendly just not very expeditious. The food was consistent with McDonald's Fair so I guess it was okay overall I mean it's McDonald's you going to like it or you don't and I'm sure most people that's reading this have at least visited one in the lifetime if not more and they're different depending on who you go to and what day but the food to be consistent if the food sucks everything about the experience sucks okay have a great day until my next one.",1
"Did you know McDonald's has a special relationship with Coke and they have the freshest, crispest, tastiest Coke you can buy anywhere?  Try it and you'll see what I go just for Coke sometimes. All soda sizes are $1.00 right now.",1
"Not 5 Stars just because of the homeless around that block. But everything inside it's all good. The food always good, the wait time always good. Never had a problem here, the only annoying are the crazy aggresive homeless that sometimes go there. Other homeless are calmed and just ask for food outside.",1
"It's just like them all but better, they have a large turnover so everything was fresh, hot and tasty, very quick and very clean upstairs, was pleasantly surprised",1
Busy but still giving outstanding service!,1
"Impressed with the service during breakfast time. When they brought the food to my table I didn't have to ask for anything. Napkins, jelly, butter, ketchup, hot cake syrup, silverware, granola for the yogurt everything was on point and fresh. Excellent!!",1
The restaurant was clean and inviting. The service was good (not great) and the food was hot and delicious.,1
Neat and clean modern,1
Good but too busy,1
"Was nearby and felt like a good burger.

They had their two for $5 fish fillet deal, so I decided to try it out.

This location is usually busy but almost always has places to sit.

Pretty good perk, also has a nice view on the 2nd floor.

The sandwiches were well made, but I퐒e also gotten sub-par burgers in the past (stale and",1
"NYC bedlam as usual,  but food was hot and good",1
"Fast service, food is good. Usually busy around lunch time. Modern looking with 3 floors to sit and self ordering kiosks. They sell pastries as well, which I haven't seen in other McDonald's.",1
Not bad 占쏙,1
Fast service but the ordering machine should be fine-tuned to be more user-friendly. There is one staff who is otherwise on standby to help guests with the machines. Dining area is clean and nicely decorated. Great views by the glass windows at the upper floors. Free Wi-Fi is pretty reliable.,1
"Fast service, food is good, and modern looking automated ordering kiosks on the wall. 3 floors to sit down and eat and I was surprised how decently clean it was when my friends and I visited here. Not sure if it is this clean on a daily basis, however",1
I did my order through the phone probably waited like 5 or 10 minutes mostly my fault for making the order as I was walking in so I understand the wait. Everything was there which I greatly appreciate.,1
The restaurant clean Covin 19 precaution was recognized by management 占쏙,1
The restaurant was very clean and the ordering experience matched my expectations. My order was ready in minutes and was exactly how I ordered it.,1
Speedy service but very rude employee she must have been frustrated but. No need for that glad I never really have to go there again,1
"Wanted a nice quiet breakfast, there was a giant inflatable rat right out the window. 10/10",1
"Got here in the wee hours and found this place very  clean, quiet and the staff was courteous. I ordered breakfast and asked for it to be fresh and hot. Glad it was made to order, palatable, and hot.  I loved being there on W 34th St, Manhattan.",1
It wasn't busy. I was attended to quick. Food was good,1
"Say what you want about McDonald's, but this location has it figured out! I really hate that I forgot to take pictures for you guys, but go here! They have order kiosks and you can have your food brought to you by one of the staff.
Something that doesn't happen often with McDonald's, but this location really was clean. There was a modern aesthetic to it, along with the pastries (never seen at anothr McDonald's).
The food did take a while but considering the wait volume (-20/30) people, I can understand.
Overall, this is a great place for cheap food to go and to stay. If you're not specific about the way you like your food, order at the kiosk (get a table marker) and go on upstairs and find yourself a table.",1
"With this MacDonalds you get your food faster from actually ordering at the register with a ""person"" vs using the kiosk",1
"Shamrock shakes are the best! Why can't they serve them all year?! The vanilla soft serve cones are great too, and a really good price. The yummiest thing is to dip your French fries in your shake. I've been coming to McDonalds since I was a kid, and it's still as good... and I'm still as excited to go there as always. Thank you for staying the same.",1
I like that there were 3 levels to this McDonald's.  They also have a security guard that you have to show your receipt to to get upstairs.  That should keep alot of people out that are just hanging out using seats and not eating. The food was typical of most McDonald's.,1
"American food in the midst of Chinatown. Reasonable seating but prices were a bit high. It's NYC you might say, but it's just a hamburger I would say.  However, several in our group noted that the burgers",1
Known food at good price. Clean areas. Not crowded.,1
"food was good, i was particularly impressed by the self order service, where i can choose what i want, pay and then just go to pickup, almost like delivery in a way. 4 stars because the staff are a little rough.",1
I had a better experience here  at this McDonald's.. they greeted me with kindness asked  me how was my day.. and offered me a courtesy meal. Without me asking.. I am grateful  and they put this cool note of gratitude  from MCDONALD'S,1
"Great coffee in the morning for only a buck any size anyway. Love it, the best coffee! Food is scrumptious especially anything on the menu but for me the breakfast is my favorite!",1
"As far as a McDonald's goes, it gets 5 stars for being clean and having quick service as well as surprisingly adequate seating. I have not given this location a rating based upon my opinion of McDonald's in general.",1
"I went on last Wednesday and the automatic machines didn't work for ordering inside. The place was full, too tight for people that were there eating. Apart from this good and quick service.",1
"I don't know if I'm like from the 20th century, but this McDonald's is super high-tech. This McDonald consists of three floors. The main floor is what you walk on to, it's the second floor. Most of the seating is on the third floor, I didn't go up to it just because I had an ankle problem and unfortunately the elevator was out. The basement, and area you can't get to it, is where the girl is it so fancy contrapment takes your food from the grill to the second floor where you order. I just thought that was cool while I was waiting around for my food. They have about six self-serving machines that are in front of the restaurant. But if you want to speak to a human you can just walk past that to the two registers they have",1
amazing. heavenly like it always is. i ate on the third floor with my family and it was very tasty. loved it a lot,1
"Good fast food as expected :) I just don't like the fact the pickup panel is not used, need to keep hearing the ladies calling your number.",1
"McDonald's food is usually the same everywhere I go. Yay fastfood. I went to this one during the Big Apple Comic Con 2017 weekend. They handled the con rush well. Costumes and hungry cos players can be a struggle, but the managers were right there with their employees making sure everything was ok. A homeless dude was asking for money. Kind of sucked, but they got rid of him quickly though.",1
"My first time at this location I order some breakfast, my order was taken to my table and it was fast, employees really nice and helpful. I would definitely visit again and I recommended.",1
First floor appear very small but it has a lot of seatings on the upper floor. Looks like it has 3 floors. The place is clean and quick with order several self order booths.,1
The cashier's are welcoming and respectful. The environment is clean and neat. Smells wonderful and I would recommend this McDonald's to family and friends.,1
Fast foods fast food.. Always busy here but fast and they didn't mess up my order so I guess that's good.,1
Good spot to just grab a quick bite. The lines vary depending on the time of day especially given the pandemic.,1
"(UPDATE)

I did my complaint thought mc Donald's website and they call me. I have my food back and a letter with apologies with a meal card....MC Donalds costumer service surprise me! Thank you for answering... That's the way... ordered Two Sausage MC Muffins and one small coffee...after almost 10 min I had to fly out the local because I was missing my 1.17am train (next is 3.30) After I told the cashier my situation I requested refund but she needed authorisation from some one who was cooking on the top floor! Mama Mia! I left running with my ticket with no food or coffee. How I get my order now...Because I payed for it!",1
"For as long as I can remember, Macdonalds has been the best fast-food chain. It always hits the craving spot.",1
Clean friendly like environment n very spaceious w view.They served the food!! At your convenience!! Eat there every morning!! N very like a classy restaurant!!!,1
The employees where very kind n tge store was clean the whole experience was pleasant the one thing wrong was they didn't have the third floor open so limited space n someone left so we could sit down they should of had tge third floor open.,1
"Clean and brightly lit. Multiple levels of seating, but was quite crowded. . Order fulfillment was super fast thanks to the app.",1
this McDonald has served me well. the best place in town to get angry in a,1
Clean restaurant. Amiable staff. The food should have been hotter.,1
"Unlike the methdonalds a block away on 8th ave & 36th, this is the poshdonalds.  When you order, you get a little plastic table stand with a number.  There is a velvet rope to get upstairs to the seating area (ok, maybe not velvet) that the man standing there pulls back for you when he sees you're holding a table stand.",1
"Me and my daughter had lunch, and loved it.",1
I don't eat McDonald's but my grandson liked this place especially the upstairs dining area. I was a little disappointed with the wait time but most of the employees were kind.,1
This is not intended to be fine dining.,1
"City is busy and this McDonald's is no exception, but the order was done Fast! Got a table and was able to enjoy my meal.",1

Excellent ,1
Its mcdonalds,1
"Even if you are not good at English, you can order from the in-store terminal and pay by credit card without any problems. It is easy to pick up because it is called by number. Although it was an eat-in, it was a packaging that could be taken out. It might be easier in Japan too.",1
"Standard, clean, tidy, food is brought to the table, not crowded, which is a plus for poppy, there are free tables, pleasant quiet background music. The main thing is CLEAN. Favorite poppy in Brooklyn. Good view of the Atlantic",1
Fries were certainly one of the worst so far. The nuggets were pretty good and I got a seat. Service was great. Even if a machine doesn't issue any receipts and you could run into problems as a result.,1
"I always visit this place whenever I have to wait for the train
Very good customer service.
I like McDonald's...
a very safe place",1
Very quiet place and good attention,1
"Mc Do with order at the terminals, a lot of space on 2 floors and very located.",1
"The best thing about it is its location but the quality of its food, its appearance and taste and service I give it a 3.",1
"This is a rather well decorated and pleasant McDonald's! In addition to being fabulously located in the middle of the gigantic skyscrapers of Broadway, this place is not excessively crowded, which makes it even more pleasant! And finally (a fundamental and important detail these days) there is Wifi! So I recommend this place! ",1
"Excellent attention, in May of this year two employees treated my husband and I very badly, they even spoke to us badly, they even scratched our food and we argued, but they are not all the same, there are very good workers...",1
A little dirty,1
"Good food, it did not have many people and there was not a long line of people, they attended us quickly, the only thing is that the bathrooms open until 8 in the morning and we arrived very early, hee",1
"A traditional MC Do, it's fast and it's good. You can take a break and enjoy the Wi-Fi.",1
Very good system to order without having to queue! Once you understand how the app works it's great for those with language difficulties! You have the option to make the hamburger to your liking! I hope I apply it soon in Argentina!,1
"The system of screens to order without having to speak to an employee is incredible because you save the long lines that are made and it comes in the language you want, (although it is only paid by card), everything is very cheap and clean, but they let you enter many homeless people who are a bit rude and occupy all the seats and sometimes you cannot sit down to eat because there is no place.",1
Pure beauty! Fast service. Agile as in most stores. Immaculate bathroom. And in this one there were two bathrooms. Different from the Mac I posted earlier. Note: The attendant speaks at least 3 languages. I liked!!!,1
We were only here for drinks. $1 for a large drink was a welcome price in expensive New York!,1
"I ate in a very clean place and the ladies who serve are very friendly, even the security is very nice. He gave me the order, thanks, everything was fine.",1
A little cleaning in the client room,1
"Exactly the same as all MacDonald's. They had a cheap menu of 1, 2 and 3 dol. I didn't like them because they gave me heartburn the 2 times I ate.",1
Good attention ,1
"For self-help travel, choosing fast food is the most convenient way to solve meals. When you are in a foreign country, you think it is unpalatable, but it is actually quite delicious.",1
"Super the new system of ordering and paying yourself and being taken to the table just by the number
The waiter is super attentive and you can ask them for the sauces you want",1
Good place in Philly!,1
Definitely better than what we are used to in Italy,1
A good and cheap alternative to eat something in Manhattan,1
Always McDonalds. They are well organized here.,1
always great,1
Good very quiet place to have breakfast near Penn Station,1
They are very loving and attentive! Congratulations!! We will always be back in a short time God willing!!,1

"The place is good, the bathroom is very dirty",1
Quick and you can eat at the local 2nd floor,1
Excellent service typical of McDonalds.,1
Fast food . Perfect coffee for the cold,1
"They treated me well and delivered what I requested, the computers did not have clear options to place the order",1
It is mc but the space is very small. In that city at rush hour you can't find where to sit.,1
"Beautiful place, the attention was very good.",1
The attention is excellent! wifi etc. Like in your country! Economic!,1
"New, orders are made digital in stores and there are fish combos here in New York",1
"Good place to eat an appetizing meal, outside of medical recommendations",1
Prompt attention. Very quiet place in the center of all the movement.,1
"Even though there are many homeless people who enter, the service is good",1
I love this food and the service is good,1
"The best Mcdonalds in the Times Square area, quiet, excellent service!",1
Fast food... Delicious... Taste similar to your country... good service...,1
EXCELLENT service all delicious and healthy ,1

Cleanest McDonald I퐒e been to in awhile. No major issues except I think my bun was molded?they said i,1
Shamrock shake was delicious... always a bit hectic in there but they get the work done,1
I placed a mobile order and within 5 minutes of entering the restaurant my order was ready. The food was really fresh and they gave me all the condiments I asked for. Great service!,1
Probably the cleanest McDonald in the city.  It's partly due to the posted security at the front door to prevent transient homelessness to take over.  Also the competent day and night managers who motivated the food preparation team to perform optimally.  This place should be the exemplary MacDonald store that all the other macDonald stores in the city should learn from.,1
They got fast hands to make a sandwich from 5 Seconds no wait in this day over crying good food hamburgers taste like McDonald's,1
"Clean, friendly staff, and fresh food prepared to order.  Extra seating upstairs too.  I'm still not a huge fan of the ordering kiosks, but so it goes...",1
The food was hot. The service was quick and professional. Drama free. ,1
Good food and kind staff. A lilbit dark,1
Great customer service during my todays visit! Great team work!,1
"Wonderful experience. Savory breakfast sandwich was exactly what I needed. Orange juice had balanced, sweet-yet-tart flavor. 5 stars.",1
"We were at the next door New York Univercity store and the kids insisted on going in once they saw the magical  iconic M, it been a while since we were at McDonalds, this time was a pleasure, the self ordering stands are amazing both to save time and to order more accurately exactly what you want, I had to order for 6 people including 4 kids so having the opp",1
The service was quick. The food is as one can can expect from a fast food restaurant but at least it's consistent.,1
Standard run of the mill McDonald's. We only had a coffee and a hot chocolate. But no problems,1
"Things get a little hectic here. The staff do a good job dealing with some intense customers. You absolutely need to check your food before leaving because things will be missing.

It's tempting to knock a star off because of that but the staff is always really nice and quick to solve the issue so they get a full five stars.",1
When you don want ,1
"Pretty busy and kind of dingy in lighting McDonalds. Service is not as fast as you might like, however the food is quite fresh.",1
Good job at night time even tho they are short,1
The place seems very understaffed for the amount of traffic that comes through this store so the registers are usually empty so order at the kiosk. The food might take a bit also but it,1
"Unfortunately had  a terrible street singer doing karaoke with a big speaker , loud and out of tune, its not the restaurant fault though they where nice",1
The Big Mac wasn't fresh but service was fast.  ( I would like to suggest everyone to download their McDonald's app. They offer great deals & rewards points to receive free food ),1
"French fries and nuggets are well
Made",1
"They had a very limited space, but to make an agile experience, they have two big touch screen menus to place your order faster than going to directly to the cashier line. They only have one unisex restroom, so if you are in a hurry, be prepared mentally to wait. Anyway I think you'll enjoy your meal, if you take in consideration these things.",1
"I ordered pickup through my phone at 10:55pm and didn't know that they close at 11pm. I felt so bad and was going to cancel my order, but they said no problem. They also gave 3 chocolate cookies for free, probably trying to get rid of it, but hey, free cookie is free cookie!",1
"Very friendly staff, looks clean & service is great",1
"The golden arches they way they should be.  Fast, easily customizable ordering (at kiosk).  Food prepared quickly (and to spec) without issue. Nice indoor space - helpful and friendly staff.  This location sets the bar pretty high.",1
The service was very good and quick and my French fries were nice and hot. There was definitely nothing that I could complain about. I would definitely stop in again the next time I'm in the area of this McDonald's.,1
Quick service easy ordering.  Not busy when I entered.,1
"NEW MANAGER, NEW VIBE. great experience!!  The homeless shelter vibe is gone, the place is clean, the service is good. Thanks for adding the security guard and the great new management. Well that didn't last long... The new manager apparently didn't last.  It's still better than it was before though..",1
"Absolutely functional! You can order fast and sure, when I went I was sure that It would take lot of time but that didn happen, the food was cooked in just a few minutes, and it",1
Pretty cool one.,1
They're rather consistent at this McDonald's. The food obviously taste the same everywhere so I don't feel I need to speak on that aspect. The workers listen and it's a quick eat everytime I go on my break so I can't complain,1
You can sit and eat inside. The quality of the food is always on point during Breakfast and lunch hours. I have yet to visit during dinner hours.,1
"Food was good , I honestly didn't really pay attention to it. I just needed to order food so I could use their bathroom to roll a blunt. The stall was big enough to spread out and break that loud up. So I twisted and bounced but the realized I left my Swisher Pack in the stall. I returned and as I was walking in a guy was coming out. He had my wrap pack in his hand to throw away when we connected eyes. So we talked for a second and decided to match. My boy met up too and we burned down. Dude musta threw some PCP on his because I was tripping balls soon after. I woke up the next day naked in a field with the cops asking questions. I dunno man. 5/7 would do again though",1
"Very quick service, surprisingly easy to operate their self service kiosk. Order was ready really fast. I usually don't go to McDonalds but I was in a tight time crunch. For a McDonald's restaurant it was not very busy. I would definitely go back to this location if I needed to go to McDonalds in New York City. Highly recommend stopping in to this location if you are in the area.",1
"This is a 24/7 location, which is great. The receipt printer was broken for a while which was annoying because they would still read off the order numbers as a method of calling people. Also, the layout is a bit odd. It narrows significantly in the middle of the store, making it hard to get through to the doors and the counter at busier times.",1
Best for quick breakfast.,1
"VERY Busy If Your Looking For ""FAST Food"" This ISN'T The Place, Depending On WHAT Time You Come, You WILL Be Waiting For YOUR Food For UP TO 15-20 Minutes....And MOST Of The Cashier's Attitudes Are WORSE Then The Wait LOL....Oh And Your Probably GOING TO Be Approached At LEAST Twice By A Junkie Or Homeless Person WHILE Your Eating....BUT Enjoy The Foods OKAY....",1
"Busy as heck, but it does what McDonalds normally do - gets you standardized food quickly without any fuss.  One-person bathroom for customers only, but two levels of seating.  Honestly, we want here because we were burned out from a day of ""touristing"" and just wanted something to eat quickly.",1
"Great service, and extremely quickly served.
Very friendly, kind and professional staff.
Will most certainly visit again.
And yes, the food in McDonald's is always satisfying. An American Classic.",1
"It's not a bad McDonald's by any stretch of the imagination, but there are better in Manhattan.  It's fairly clean, there's plenty of seating, the food was made well.  There are none of those fancy new ordering kiosks, and the bathrooms are dirty.",1
Very clean nice friendly staff & the coffee is delicious. I enjoy the 2 for $6 fish sandwiches.,1
"The place is not crowded, because the staff work really fast. They are so nice and friendly. ",1
"Very convenient location where you have NYU School, NYU Bookstore, subways and buses, Footlocker, Buffalo Exchange store, Washington Square Park, Joe's Pub, Donut shop (I highly recommend), etc. Lots of students around....always a busy area however; McDonald's is kept clean, on time with food, but go at a time when it's less busy.",1
"Got my order quickly, unfortunately had to eat outside. Just spoils the experience. Can't wait til this covid thing blows over.",1
Better service than usual. manager moved my order along. He wanted my order number to ease the wait!!,1
"It was my first time visiting this location it was nice. It was clean, staff was helpful. I would visit again if in the area.",1
"Not bad manager is rude to customers n employees, food was good kid at register was very nice",1
It was really busy and the late night staff was out numbered but they pulled through and did a very great job. I am very proud of them and also my sammie was yummy,1
"Taylor was absolutely amazing to me...
This was great experience after having bad ones at other locations. Very happy. Will come again.",1
Ive been going to this location for a long time and when the seats began to look worn they were there within a few days to renovate and make it sparkle again.,1
Restaurant is a ghost town and I am thankful for it (lots of non paying customers normally around). Food is fresh and staff is very efficient.,1
"crispy spicy chicken sandwich,crispy spicy chicken sandwich,crispy spicy chicken sandwich is all i have to say you must stop in and get it and mix it with a hamburger and you will have whats called a mcgangbang you will be glad that you did so, and will never get anything else, please stop and get a milkshake and fries with a stop in there.",1
"Walked in and ordered, easy peasy. The counterperson helped me with my order. The lobby was very clean!",1
"One of the best McDonald's in the West Side Uptown, they're actually fast, food is always well coked and good care of customers and this one has a customized dispenser!",1
"Its... McDonald's. If you've been to one you've practically been to them all. Service was nice enough around breakfast time, food quality can be hit or miss, do they even care about Google reviews?",1
Have to wait for a while before I,1
Clean and efficient service as well as a delicious menu.,1
There was a very bad smell in the store fr a homeless guy but it is OK w me... we all have to live w compassion and understanding ...,1
"Love how they serve your meal if you eat it, and how much easier it is to pay as well.  Family friendly place.",1
"Very helpful, I got a nice vibe from the people that were working tonight. It was the best time waiting for McDonald's, especially their music tunes ",1
I had gone there to study was able too get a lot of work done plus food is great an customer service awesome.,1
It's was fast service and it was cleaning up well there..,1
"Meals and counter service have improved. Open 24 hours to a diverse crowd of locals, tourists and visitors.",1

The best tacos I've ever eaten. Friendly and smooth service that runs like a machine. Los Tacos No. 1 really needs to come to the Netherlands! Or rather not... otherwise I will gain a few kilos.,1
Mc Donald 's but with the best sandwiches ... could it have been hunger?,1

Good food and attention. Good option to get out of trouble at all times,1

I always send via Jedlog and they are punctual.,1
Generally good care. In the United States it has a good price.,1

Whether in New York or elsewhere: Mc Do is equal to itself!! correct!,1

"Very convenient location, area looks safe. The staff is friendly and fast. The restaurant is open 24 hours a day. The fries were very fresh and my Big Mac was perfect. There are some downsides: it's always very crowded and they don't take cash when paying.",1
The staff is not good. Rude. Didnt even heaitate to take my order. I was trying the screen when The manager came and took another persons order and then i gone to him and had the order taken. He was helpful and in 2 mn my order was ready. Had some beggars on premises asking for money. Was not busy. Had lots of free seats.,1
Nice McDonald's in a high class section and the staff was friendly. I enjoyed eating lunch there and sitting and relaxing.,1
"Normally, I do not use McDonald for meat products on a Friday I do not have any option as a muslim and do not find any Halal restaurant nearby then I go McDonald and try to get some fish fillet and fries some drink",1
The service was excellent even at all hours very hard worker and very clean for the amount of traffic flow. My experiences here have been memorable. Keep up the amazing work McDonald's.,1
"Got two Filet-O-Fish sandwiches.  Both were good as expected.  I ordered through the McDonald's app and opted to pickup my sandwiches at the drive thru.  I told the employee at the speaker that I had an app order to pickup and gave her the code.  She instructed me to go to the first window.  There I was given the receipt, thanked, and told to go to the next window.  At the 2nd window I was told to go to a 3rd window to pickup the order.  The 3rd window is kind of funny, since it seems like an afterthought.  Since it is at the corner of the building close to a sign, it is difficult to get close enough to be handed the order without scraping the side of your car. Then to leave you have to turn your wheels hard right.  The employees were very friendly.",1
"Fast and reliable McDonald's, the McFlurry machine is always working which is a nice bonus.

The IPU boys can lick my butt.",1
Drive thru friendly and the request on how u want your food they comply.......kristy ...very friendly real customer service,1
"Driving can be a bit awkward here, with a sightly confusing entrance/exit and with very limited parking that can get clogged when there are cars entering or leaving.  That said, they've consistently done a good job filling my orders and never given me any reason to complain in that regard.",1
Wonderful staff. Very accommodating. Food was made quick and well,1
Yummy yummy ,1
"Well no body tells you you have to order in the machines cause supposedly they take orders and the register but not body comes to get your order I wait , and wait , and wait for 8 mint aproximily and no one get my order ...and did and the machine ...but the company had to understand no all the people can order ...like people use glasses and forget them , old people don't know the technology or you don't bring your card to pay ... I know is easier ...but at least have to be one person to take your order on these cases . Well is my respectfully opinion",1
"It's mc Donald's,      what else does one explain?",1
Of course this is my home McDonald's so I know how it works and how quick they are and how good they are and I never have a problem with this place it's not big it's just a small one in and out it's all you do I like that,1
"Ive been here before and given them 1 star due to slow processing of order, been here again and it change  so giving them 4 star. lets come back and check again next time.",1
The best food quality was the best ever.,1
Glad I walked in. The drive-thru line was ginormous. (TWO lines!) Ordering inside was pretty easy - a couple order kiosks or a plexi-barrier'ed pair of cash registers. Time spent waiting was a lot less than if waiting in the drive thru lanes(s). Clean tables and floor - actually being mopped while I was there.,1
"Quick accurate drive through. Maybe too quick when not sure what is being ordered. I asked about new $6 deal. She rattled off what comes with deal and placed order and gave total before I could digest what she said.  Slow down!
Fries were perfect. I love the fries!",1
Qu8ck drive through service. Staff was nice. Food good as usual.,1
"The food was good and fresh but the order was missing the fries I had ordered with the combo, I ordered but didn't get the receipt, and when I tried telling them the order was missing an item, they told me I needed a receipt, I get that, but the fact that they didn't give me one, and I gave them the order number and everything even showed them the order I received, but they still wouldn't give me the item that was missing",1
Same gas station in Chula Vista read my other post hey follow me too leave a remark on my work,1
Drive thru service is awesome. I haven pulled my wallet out yet to pay from coming around the corner after ordering and I can see the second window with a worker holding my or,1
"Mobile ordering has made buying easier and coupled with their unbeatable deals makes for great fast food. As others have said, parking is scarce and cramped and the interior is VERY cramped. I recommend drive through all the way",1
"We have to go to Burger King, we have more then 15 minutes waiting and both lines was very slow. No moves at all",1
"This McDonald's has probably been remodeled two or three times. The interior is TINY. Like REALLY TINY. If you're here hunting happy meal toys, they charge you $2 for the toy, some places will charge only $1. You can use the McDonald's app here, but beware the tricky mobile app order and pay. Mobile is a pain to use, they're not always able to know where your order is, and it takes way longer to order on your phone or at a kiosk than it does in person. Drive-through doesn't get too bad because there's tons of food options nearby.",1
This location is pretty nice. I haven't gone inside but I go through the drive thru pretty frequently! Everyone is always very nice and I always get my food quickly. ,1
Love the pricing and unique item offerings.,1
"I happen to love Tommy's, but it definitely is not everyone's cup of tea. Their chili burger is their traditional specialty. It has meat, chili, tomato, onions, and pickle. The chili seems greasy but I love it.

Tommy's is an acquired taste. I've been going to the original tommys since 1968 in Los Angeles at Beverly and rampart. That shack is open twenty-four hours a day, and you basically eat outside, putting your food on a ledge and standing to eat it.

This Tommy's is a more traditional restaurant, where are you give your order inside, pick it up and sit down in comfort.

I love that the fries are large because they hold the heat much longer than small fries.

I used to order extra chili with my hamburger, and it made things very messy. What I learned at this visit was to have the chili put on the side, so I could add it as I wanted.

there are many different types and flavors to chili. This was brought home to me one time when I was at the original Tommy's and picked up my burger and drink right after a couple. They ended up eating nearby, and I heard the mail of the couple exclaim, ""That's not good chili!""

I was wondering what part of the Southwest he was from because of his critique. I just about choked on my drink when I heard him say, ""If you want good chili, you need to come to New York!""

I'm sure that there are good places to get chili in New York, but that guy was probably one of the people that considers everything west of the Hudson River to be a dining desert.",1
Top G,1
Definitely a super busy drive-through between the hours of 7 and 830 my order was taken accurately food was hot and it seemed like it was fresh ....no issues,1
"I don't know why but I love their cheeseburgers, something about the flavor of the meat that I really like. I got 2 Mcdoubles and 6 chicken Mcnuggets for 5 bucks, its a good snack for a cheap price.",1
"This location is I've of the better ones. Friendly and quick service. Food comes as expected and the fries are as good as you might expect from McDonald's - which is amazing.

It's McDonald's bro. MURICA.",1

I was delighted with the service and the food,1
"There are no snacks from Brazil, I wanted a Big Tast so bad ",1
He surprised me with the new burger that has bacon on it. The truth is delicious!,1

"On March 13, I was at this cafe and I really liked the staff, they were so polite and caring.

I especially liked the friendly guy, the employee at the entrance, he met everyone at the entrance, greeted and opened the door. This guy was so sweet and caring, I just saw such great employees in this fast food chain. He is simply worthy of the award as the most customer-oriented employee. I also really liked the kitchen, everything is cooked very quickly here and what is rare in these restaurants, they make excellent coffee here.",1
"This is my go to McDonald's spot at 262 Canal St. There are seats available to sit downstairs and upstairs. I like the atmosphere and spaciousness. The staff working here are friendly and polite. Today only you can get a free Mc chicken, no purchase necessary. I redeemed my free Mc Chicken, it was fresh and warm when I got mine.",1
This is a such a different design of McDonald's. I love it!,1
Very nice and friendly staff I felt welcome. They are very clean and attentive. They have table service. They have the machines that you can order by yourself. They have soda dispenser so free refills. They have 3 floors. They have bathrooms for men and women. The bathroom was nasty and dirty.,1
"Clean place faster service,  well trained staff and you can get the food for to go or stay there.  Even the ordering machines are cleaned frequently. So you get a great service.",1
"After exploring Chinatown in lower Manhattan, I decided to walk to the only McDonald's in the immediate area, on the south side of Canal Street. It didn't look like much from the outside, but once I entered I walked up to the counter to order one coffee which took a few minutes since the place was somewhat busy and there was a customer in line in front of me.

I got my order and walked upstairs to the first level and sat at a comfortable booth. Within a few minutes a manager came to my table to ask if everything was OK, and I told him ""Yes"", but I was having trouble to connect to the free WiFi. He immediately helped me with this and although the connection was slow, I was pleased that the problem was solved.

Then the manager chatted with me and asked if I would mind doing a survey and I filled out the online survey. Then he said I was entitled to a free burger so I had a Big Mac.

I think this is a very well managed place and will definitely return when I am back in Manhattan in the Chinatown area.",1
The location was great - but the side lobby was packed with kids smoking weed.,1
"Nice quiet spot,on loud cell phones playing music.good McDonald's for the old folks.",1
Very fast and served hot! Very rare in New York to meet quick and nice service from McD,1
Food was fresh and out quick. Can,1
"Pretty much a regular McDonald's, has a second floor though. That's cool.",1
Too crowded. Staff need to have a better way of taking care of customers' orders. Took a long time for my order to be prepared. Nice staff though,1
"Space is small, typical for area. Limited seating on ground level.  Additional seating and Restrooms upstairs",1
"Just the best McDonald's in Manhattan in my opinion, free refills, A third floor!???! Would come again.",1
It's a McDonald's. The kiosks were working and the service was quick. I didn't go upstairs to check out the dining room.,1
"The food was came out little late, but the clerk gave apple pie for service. I was really satisfied. The icecream cone is little expensive than any other country.",1
I had a big Mac here and it is the only big Mac I've ever had in me life that the meat was hot,1
A really good place to eat. The place is very clean.,1
It was Mc Donalds!. I was hoping that this  Mc Donald packaging would have  Chinese wrapping  since this Mc Donalds is located in Chinatown.,1
"They have a cleaning person constantly wiping, mopping the door, bathroom, floor and everything else inside. Very impressive",1
It's McDonald's it's fast and staff is as friendly as it gets. Just don't be rude and they won't be rude. The staff gives attitude to people who give them attitude first.,1
"The variety of food offered by this restaurant is great! They also value their customers, always making sure that our needs are met and we are happy with the service.. McDonalds - Thanks a lot!",1
Everything is chinese here! I'm loving mc-dimSums,1
My best experience with Mango pin smooth was excellent and fast delivery good services,1
I'm glad I enjoy the food.,1
"I love this place, feeling welcome all the time. The most of times, the staffs serve fast and give out the correct orders.
I ordered 2 times thru the apps and then, they already can call my name when I walking in!",1
Cofe was so bad... just a hot water,1
"Friendly staff,quick service,nice taste",1
Good prompt service as one would expect from them. Only negative is that the soda fountain is still closed and they still only offer bottled soda which is more expensive and not cold.,1
Manager 폦auri,1
Great experience and great food,1
Employees are very kind and polite,1
Typical US McDonald's just in china town New York,1
Good deal. Today I bought vanilla shake with a deal buy one get one free. So I paid $5 for 2 large shake. At Chinatown still only take out.,1
"Clean & convenient location, with plenty of seating on the upper floors.",1
"This McDonald's just east of Broadway on Canal is a good McDonald's. Are here twice recently and the food was fine. This McDonald's is much better than the McDonald's about half a mile South on Broadway, south of Chambers. That south McDonald's had old, heat dried out food the four times I was there.",1
"Hasn't had soda fountain for awhile, pretty fast and friendly. Always busy though, don't expect a seat.",1
"This is a pandemic post .
Love McDonalds I frequent for coffee or light meals on my way home. Recently they announced #CampMcDonalds so every other day I was in McDonalds trying to get the rewards",1
"Friendly staff, fast service, great place. You can enjoy your meal without any hassle.",1
Would've gave them 5 stars but too many homeless people are inside,1
Too crowded but they were managing it well....bathrooms were too dirty !!,1
"Stopped in just for an ice coffee. Their ice coffee is solid overall, & an awesome bargain ($1 via app).",1
The service is always very good. The food is always served fresh and very hot. It's delicious. I enjoy all the meals in this McDonald's. The Milk Shakes are a dream come true. The staff is very friendly and the establishment is very clean. I highly recommend this McDonald's.,1
"Great family friendly, entertaining teenage students too. But... The toilets are too horribly maintained., Smelly, No mirrors... used Tissue were heaped openly- Very non hygienic. May be the management is too busy & short staffed ? ",1
Clean and functional with working kiosks. I always advise that the McDonald's App is great for deals and ordering ahead but of course at times the place can be very busy.,1
Always a dependable place to have a quick meal. Food was as good in New York as in L.A.!,1
It was actually a pleasant visit picking up and placing an order.  The staff behind the counter this morning were very friendly.,1
I have never been to such a clean place and what I ordered a big Mac this burger was exceptionally delicious I never seen such a well prepared burger since I was a kid the atmosphere was tranquil considering it was rush hour and service was great polite even someone from outside came in asking for money immediately manager came to check it out but the individual was gone by the time manager came upstairs which was very quick,1
Cool place downtown by Canal St,1
"It's McDonald's. You kinda know what to expect. One thing you should be prepared for if you're not a native of Manhattan, it's very pricy. I guess paying for the N.Y. rent causes the prices to be higher than what we have in Texas. The service was fast and organized, despite being very busy, just don't expect to get your usual meal for your usual price. Happy travels!",1
Good service but a lot of strange people entering the store. People asking for money in aggressive way and the people in line ordering food looked concerned.,1
Very friendly morning staff,1
A different mcds in chinatown.,1
So just to clarify I did not actually eat here BUT I am from the south and a huge fan of sweet tea! Also everywhere you go around here water bottles are around $3. We went to this McDonalds in hopes of finding sweet tea in NYC and we were successful! You have to get it from behind the counter but it was good and only $1 for a large just like back home. Cheapest drink I had our whole trip!,1
"Pretty good space employees are nice and courteous. Bathrooms are quite clean and all in all, this place is seated/ built well. Chairs are nice and comfortable. Overall, I recommend this place to others",1
No compliant  friendly customer service  and food was given in a timely  fashion,1
"Is nice place they kipper clean up all the time, good service",1
"I love these lashes! My lashes are very short and very straight. The light glam lashes give a full look and gives me so much volume. People always ask me if my lashes are real and I tell them yeap, I use castor oil and drink a lot of water lol!!",1
"羲羲羲羲 Happy 羲羲 Thanksgiving 2019. 羲羲羲羲

This McDonald羲? located at 262 Canal Street, in Chinatown, New York City have been here for ages.

All McDonald羲? are created equal in terms of cleanliness, so it is no surprise that it is very clean, neat, tidy and spotlessly clean.

It is a huge McDonald羲? because it has 3 stories, but on the second and third floor, there is a limited number of chairs.  Poor design left it with about 40 to 50 seats on the 2 top floors.

The staff is very professional, friendly and polite with a smile, and there are staff who are bilingual {English and Chinese) (English and Spanish).

Enjoy  Mickey D羲?  and

A Happy Thanksgiving.",1
The service was quick..courteous and easy...they also have a self order kiosk which makes ordering quick and simple...by the time you get to the casheier ur order is filled...  The is a ATM machine and bathrooms upstairs. .a nice place with plenty of table space on the second floor...enjoy!!!!,1
"The restaurant is kept clean and service is fast. It's like the usual McDonald's you'd expect, but better. However, the food there is slightly priced higher than usual prices at different McDonald's. Overall, I'd recommend.",1
"Wonderful view over Broadway/ Central Park. Service is very good. You take a tablenumber, place your order yourself and no matter which floor you sit and wait for your order to be brought to you, they'll find you. Amazing.",1
Good place for a quick bite. Their menu has gotten better. They will add new items to their menu every few months which is very nice of them to keep attracting customers.,1
"This, location/different, 20 years ago, this place, was once, tourist, haunted, land, N, R, NO.6, subway exit, CANAL street, people flow, and popularity, prosperity, McDonald's It is also one, young, male and female, especially many, brought, youth, breath, order, this place, a lot of color, that year, my favorite is happy meal, there are many fathers, bring children here, enjoy .",1
"At 3AM it is like an oasis in the desert!! We originally went in to use the bathroom but ended up getting soft drinks, felt guilty using their facilities without buying anything.... filthy bathrooms but very courteous staff and interesting clientele!! As with all McD's, NO PAPER TOWELS in restrooms... BUT for what it is (McD's), it is 5 star.",1
A great place to socialize with my friends,1
This is the best dang McDonald's in NEW YORK CITY. It has bathrooms with stalls that are very clean. It smells of Big Macs and hope. What a wonderful discovery during my visit to Chinatown. God bless Ronald Mcdonald.,1
"It was absolutely amazing!!! I went around closing time and it was no waiting time to be seated and my server Ty , was amazing!!!!! I had a great time and the drinks do it for me every time!!!! Hands own one of my favorite places to eat and drink!!",1
"This review is on their bathroom and small fries for obvious reasons.
So glad this place is 24hours.... I needed to use their bathroom so badly at ~10pm. I ordered a small fries and ran upstairs....there was toilet paper, which is a huuuge plus-- but their mirror...I think someone stole it or something. There is just hand soap on the wall and where the mirror should be, were just screw holes...? LOL WELP",1
"The location is alway clean despite always being busy.  My food always comes out hot (huge plus for me).  I ordered the fillet-o fish sandwich, and a small dr.pepper.
I live near a McDonald's in Brooklyn, but the food quality sucks.  So despite living closer to the Brooklyn location, I would rather get my food from this location and travel home to eat it. Lol",1
It's a McDonald as you would expect. Great if you want a quick bite but if you want a good meal go somewhere else. This location was just fine. Service was great and the food arrived fast.,1
My kids like eat Macdonald,1
"It's much cleaner now than it used to be. They also have touchscreen monitors you can order from now, which is convenient. I found things that I never knew was on the menu!",1
I have to admit to be so late and night and cheating on my never ending diet the McDonald's was clean friendly fresh fries and so welcoming. Now I cant say this for all McDonald's but I had to share it was a very pleasant experience.,1
"Today, one of my items was forgotten, but I will check in tomorrow about it for a replacement. Otherwise, pleasant staff and quick service.",1
"Have a couple kiosks in the front _ easy and nice to use. Lots of customizable things to the order. Make sure you scroll to the bottom and check out the deals and promotions. Order was prepared pretty quickly and correct. No big complaints, about as good an experience that McDonalds can be.

Pro tip: on the kiosk when you are checking out and it asks for your ""location code""... Just click 'cancel'. It's an error in the system.",1
I like the new upgrades to this store. Food comes out quick. I just hate all the homeless people and the random drunk fight (also homeless) that happen here. I got knocked around for no reason once.,1
"Great coffee on a weekday.

Coffee on a Saturdays, not so much.",1
Clean and nice not same as old ones seats are availabilities and kids can play at other place high seats too looking good comfortable with waiting in line,1
Good place to find bathrooms,1
Very nice and clean place and very fast service,1
"Got an ATM with $1.19 fee, cheapest one i could find so far",1
Visit mcds in China Town thinking it was going to have different menu items but that wasn't the case,1
Extremely busy establishment. Seating was a problem.,1
"I understand that it's just fast food but I eat fast food frequently .  Just lack the budget to indulge in sushi and other fine fare lol
I'm also not a sushi person. I love as six mc Donald's for their cheap juicy burger, fast orders and cheap shakes, or if I'm feeling like I want something lighter ony stomach and it's late, a grilled chicken salad, side asald or parfait is great. Excellent for my son, who asks for the yogurt in his kids meal. The mozzarella sticks is also a perfect edition. Their coffee exceeds bk and I loved this location wen visiting last month. Quick easy and clean with upstairs seating. The workers for friendly and helped me when they forgot a drink.",1
"Service is good, never had a problem while ordering, even if I took long and was undecided the cashier had no issue and was very helpful and respectful",1
"Very busy McDonald's next to Chinatown, lots of Asian staff for those who are not fluent in English, seating is always full but security actively enforce the no loitering rule.",1
Great place even for a McDonald's and the staff are kind and always willing to help. No problem getting your food changed and the lines are never too long.,1
Manager saw me waiting a little longer than usual and went back to the kitchen to see what was wrong and got back with my order. Very thoughtful!,1
This place is great and I would want everyone to go the place looks nice the people are great and the food is cheap great for big families so I hope you enjoy everything there,1
"Sometimes a little difficult to place the order however the staff are very friendly and the managers are always trying to get orders completed fast.

The food was always good and great coffee.",1
"Fast friendly service, but no dine-in and no bathroom even if you're pregnant.",1
Great fantastic,1
Everything so good!!!!! Thank you,1
THE STAFF AT THIS LOCATION ARE ACTIVE AND VERY ENGAGING. THEY ARE PEOPLE PERSON AND HAVE STRONG ATTENTION TOWARD THEIR CUSTOMERS. THE INTERIOR OF THE RESTURANT IS VERY CLEAN.,1
"Service was good, bathroom is clean. One think I didnt like is garbage bags outside on the sidewalk.",1
LOL this Macky Ds is a fun one to go when you want to hit up Chinatown and all its glory!  I think I ate there only once and it was like any other Mc Ds but alot more people and alot more drama...a sight to be seen!,1
"Small size, fairly clean and seating upstairs but not very wheelchair accessible seating.",1
"Atlantic Terminal. Busy place because another Mc Donald's is being renovated.  I used app to order so no wait.  Because so busy, a little dirtier than normal.",1
"The food was so delicious, better than other McDonald's.  Also love that location and the ambience.",1
I love the burger that freshly made. I like the place. Nice facilities and clean. Fast services. Friendly staff. Good job.,1
Best place ever got good food and my grandpa still love it since a long time ago,1
The service was really friendly and fast. By the time i got the change my order was ready!,1
It was a bit crowded but the service was fast and friendly. My only downside was there was no handicap access to the upper floors.,1
"Everything is real good u gonna like it employees,food,place excellent.",1
Usually very pleased with the experience.,1
im in love with mc donalds<3 i go there all the time. and im pretty sure everyone loves it . my favorite thing to order is the mc flurry! and the nuggets and chiken slects. the kids always get happy with the happy meals.,1
Excellent location. This place is not very clean because it's too crowdy.,1
Tasty Food. Recieves Food very fast. Nice Service and Kept Neat. Two Floors to sit and Eat. Mostly Crowded.,1
"They are very friendly, friendlier than any other branches out here in New York.",1
As good as they come for a McDonalds. Plenty of seats. Friendly workers. Unlocked bathrooms. Clean establishment.,1
I went late at night and they were out of a few things. Nothing I was trying to order though--quick and efficient. Be wary that NYC doesn't have deals on the McDonald's app like other cities do.,1
Delicious fast food!,1
Not cleanest,1
Good & fast service... Busy but you won't have to wait long...,1
AShun sign gone bring my money right ther they work hard!,1
One of the cashiers were nice because there was no line ordering food was like chatting.,1
"Workers especially on young man order taker /cashiet eas excellent.  Too bad I didn""ask his name.",1
It had good service and multiple floors so there wasn't much crowding.,1
Fast service and ok food but no where to sit due to bums laying in the booths upstairs. Maybe get some employees to check up there occasionally.,1
Great place for kids. You know what you're getting. Very easy to find with the sign from the street,1
on a messy knockoff block,1
Just happy to find a place to get something quick to eat.,1
Food was fast fresh and hot. Place was clean with rapid service,1
I will recommend this gym to everybody,1
"This place is ok, nice and quiet",1
"It's a McDonalds, you get what you expect from here every time. As a place for very fast, cheap, and consistent food it's good,",1
"This location always has a crowd so I gave 4 stars, however they are extremely fast in service. So if you're running late into the office this is the place to stop.",1
"For a mcdonalds in an extremely busy area,  I think the staff were doing a great job keeping everything moving.  The area was clean enough (and I am particular about that), the kiosks were in working order besides one but it didn't hold up the orders at all.  Food deals were clearly marked,  the ordering system wasn't correct as you usually grab a tent and go to a table but one of the staff saw us wondering about it and told us to just put a number in... so they were clearly attentive to what was going on around them.  Food came out quickly.  Same cost for food as any other mcdonalds anywhere.  Great, quick,  cheap food for a late evening.",1
"Take out as ordered, good service across shifts, floors mopped , people working respectively to each other. Good for busy place.",1
"Dirty table, but there are empty seats to eat in. The atmosphere is not bad for McDonald's. Their app doesn't have good deals anymore.",1
Cheap and fast order! Tasty drink!,1
"Nice place bery busy but the crew handle great, also the food is on point few mcs have this, i could eat again there",1
"Quick, clean and organized. The only downside, a lot of people... I was sitting near some rather rude people but I can't really blame the restaurant for that. Just a negative.",1
This location has a young crowd on the weekend.  They play good music while you drink frappe and have a big mac.,1
Got the Mcrib it was incredible and absolutely delicious,1
The employees are quick to help you. They keep the place clean. They help the indigent. They make sure the orders are correct for the correct person.,1
Good place. Fast service if is a lot of people in there.,1
"Very clean and modern.  Fast service, just like mom.占쏙",1
Nice mac,1
Real quaint place to eat for breakfast. Great staff.,1
A little busy but great spot to grab a burguer and keep sight seeing!,1
It was good and they got the food fast,1
The team that control that restroom and back seats entry are great! Best McDonald's in the area. Cleanest one as well.,1
"Asked for pickle on my chicken sandwich, got 8 pickles. My sister is picky and orders her burgers with not ketchup, mustard or onions with extra pickles. They nailed that. Her chicken nuggets were nice and crispy. The only complaint I'd that the fries were a little soggy, but they were still hot, so it cancels out the sogginess.",1
I wanted 2 barbecue sauce packets and they forgot to give me it.,1
"Very up to date McDonald's. Great customer service and fast service.
This is the first fast food service spot that I got my food in less than 7 mins . Usually I'm waiting 20 minutes.",1
"I am a big fan of Mc'Donalds, I have tried it in more than 21 countries so how can I skip when I am in New York, USA.
Same taste different country.",1
Nice clean place and quick service,1
Service poor no one speaks English to much beggers,1
"We went in the evening on our way back to the hotel from a trip to the Liberty Island. We were really hungry so we ordered lots of stuff. The food and drinks were good. The place has lots of seating space, and you can order on the self-help kiosks. It seemed like the restrooms were not open as there was a gate towards its entrance but we didn't care because our hotel was nearby.",1
"Went for late lunch and it was pretty busy. However, security was on top of it for everything including making sure tables were cleaned immediately after someone left. All in all a good experience",1
Very clean not crowded food was actually hot,1
"PROS: This McDonalds is located right next to Madison Square garden making it an easy stop right before or after the game. They are also very clean and the staff seemed to be nice. The food came fast compared to other fast food places in the city

CONS: The touchscreens that you order your food on had a tough time scanning the vaccine card and the place was small inside compared to other fast food places.

OVERALL: Great place near the garden but isn't my go-to when I hit that area of the city",1
"Staff is nice and they are fast to get the food out. I only go in the morning for breakfast on the way to work. Only issues are the norm in many places. they don't clean the kiosks often and they are no wipes to do it yourself, and have to be careful of people crowded by the doors.",1
Very  good clean restaurant 占쏙,1
Your typical McDonald's. Which is generally why people visit McDonald's all around the world. Consistency. Could be a little cleaner. But nothing that would turn one off. Reasonable experience. Reasonable service. With expected pricing.,1
Who don't like McDonald's Mickey D's Mickey D's I'm digging it I love my espresso,1
It is great thant you can actually eat inside the place no like many other restaurants in the area at the moment because of the omicron variant. The bad thing it's that the personal in these particular McDonald's is slow... you're going to have to wait for your food at least 5 to 10 minutes..... It is the price you have to pay if you want to eat inside haha,1
"Nice place, service is very quick and great atmosphere",1
I ordered a coffee the service was super fast and just how I like it. The people behind the counter were so nice and easy. It even came along with a smile and a thank you.,1
Not too busy everything was clean and service was good wait time wasn long even though their was a decent amount of customers. And food was fresh as could be for fast food. Also not one employee was rude. Good visit and would recommend this one over some others in area.,1
"Maybe the quickest McDonald's I've ever been to.

My order was out in 2 minutes max on a busy afternoon.",1
"Almost always a scene here.. impatient people, sometimes some yelling goes down..but I always get my order in fast and easy. If there's a line, use the digital kiosk. If not, use the human. Never waited more than 5 min here for a big Mac or double.",1
"Pretty clean place, crowded of course but that can be overseen when you find a table. Service is pretty speedy, got my food pretty quickly. Security by the bathroom though, need your receipt just to use it. Gets annoying hearing ""ma'am wait, sir your receipt?"" ""You need a receipt"". Tip, don't throw away your receipt until you leave, and don't sit next to the bathroom if you don't wanna hear that everytime a person tries to enter the bathroom.",1
McDonald's is always clean and serves fresh fast food,1
Was there with my 2 year old(kids meal 4 piece chicken nuggets). I was attempting to use the kiosk when one of the employees a young lady came immediately to assist. She explained the process and took me to a register to check out. Within 4 minutes I had placed my order and had my food. Wonderful service though there were a lot of customers. Wonderful experience.,1
"Normally all the Macdonald's are the same. They have to keep the standard what is the Franchise of the Macdonald's request from who is getting enter to be one the franchise one..  For me the best item they have in their menu is the ""French fries 占쏙"".
I love to Go  around the many places in the world.  And enjoy one of the fries. Sometimes they introduced a new drink. Now they are getting innovated  and you can order your food  in the internet. Delivered to you by IFood.",1
I wanna hug whoever made my order @ 12:30AM because the fries were so crispy and quarter pounder was perfect,1
"Very friendly staff! The cashier right away greeted us and asked what we would like to order. She was also very helpful explain the offers that were available. Service was fast, quick and extremely efficient. Waiting time was less than 5 minutes. Good fast food spot for a quick bite to eat! They also offer order yourself service and of course on the app too! Food was good. The only reason I couldn't give this McDonald's a 5 stars was because many tables and chairs to eat in were a bit dirty. Also, the restrooms were dirty it could have been better other than that #eatoutside and don't forget if you like my review please give it a thumbs up!",1
"Great service. Clean. Unfortunately, they have seedy people that love hanging out on the side walk. This is not Mc Donald's fault. However, I feel safe and satisfied with the pace of service.",1
"Thank you guys, for your job and the effort to keep the place at the nice level, even sometimes becomes messy, but you always were friedly and ready to prepare my food order ( not the healthiest option tho ), but you always saved me from starving",1
"It's a decent McDonald's.  The issue is its location,  it's  a high tourist area and hub for New Yorkers to do a lot of shopping or transferring bus/trains. That also comes with people who are on drugs, homeless and so on. But it's not that bad",1
Very clean decent bathroom.   Lots of lost soles during the week hanging out.  But they are kept low and behaved. Bathroom is kept clean and decent and they have a wall of ordering terminals to is. I do suggest using an app and having it ready rather then the touch screen. They have a long delay and it's a bit to order.,1
Love to get my breakfast from this Mcdonald store. The coffee and tea is the best. I also like their pancakes and sausage.,1
I enjoy this mc Donald's however you can't use the bathroom without first showing the receipt ,1
"Crazy busy and usually encompassed with 8th Ave nutters but the security keeps everyone in check;  they've always gotten my order right and regardless how busy, they always manage to get orders out pretty darn quick. #ghettoefficiency",1
I didnt have a mask cause it suddenly broke while on line and the cashier offered me a mask. I thought that was so awesome i was so happy causw they made me feel welcomed and not embrassed. The staff was pleasant and quick serving.,1
"McD's is a good place to eat fairly cheaply! The wait time for your food DOES vary from restaurant to restaurant though! (Sometimes great! & sometimes terrible!). The food quality seems to be the same from restaurant to restaurant! I love their sweet tea!, regular cheeseburger, and their fantastic fries! I would recommend it to people looking for a decent meal at a reasonable price!",1
"It was crowded (it's New York tho) but the security guard was always making sure people to use the mask...  and it was fast even with the amount of orders. On time, good food, right order. Simply Mc Donalds.",1
"Fast service, but while I was there on vacation staying accross the street the service was a bit harsh.",1
You usually don't associate McDonald fast food with good quality but with this shop you really have to. The design of every thing was actually elegant in a way and the service is quick and polite. And you have to believe it when I say the burgers in there actually looks  like the ones being advertised on TV all the time. The taste and qualities of the food are 10 out of 10 for me,1
It looks crazy outside because of the people but very clean and put together inside. Security is on point! Felt very safe waiting for my food ,1
We came here late and hungry. Our man Arturo helped us out and was patient and good with us. New York is a wild town but he didn,1
Got my order pretty fast.,1
Istopped in at this location at 3 am on Sun morning it was super busy and understaffed. Surprisingly however  the overwhelmed staff was super nice. Even through the place was crowed it didn't take long to get a customized order. The bathroom was understandably a mess.,1
Like the modern look inside and nice seating. Great atmosphere for casual Hangout with friends. Kiosk there helps when the lines are too long. Cashiers are friendly and nice.,1
"Bathroom door lock is broken.

Went from 3 to 5 stars since it's the best looking macdo I found in NYC.
I ended up coming multiple times there.

America should reconsider what the standard is, European Mc Do are way cleaner, service is faster.",1
Good and fast that what you call fast food,1
"I폻 expect a McDonald near Penn Station to be pretty terrible, but they퐒e actually kept this location reasonably nice. It",1
Due to the COVID pandemic things have evolved and MacDonalds is definitely updating its customer service. There are self-counters now to place orders. The service has improved for good! Great burgers!,1
The service was quick and easy,1
The people at the store we're so rude. The manager was keeping her cool. Good job. Once I actually ordered my stuff came out fast and correctly.,1
Well this McDonald's has been known through out the City as not recommended place to eat but that's are people Opion. I've known this places just like anywhere else as far as people coming in and starting problems. Any way this place I gave it a 5 cause the employees are very respectful  clean when you oder there's a couple of employee's that I like to mention. Mr. Noe is a young man that does almost everything behind the counter very respectful fast worker is important in a fast food business. Next  Rosalva  is also a very respectful employee she works behind the counter greets you with a real smile not only welcome to McDonald's and a fake smile you could tell the difference  Third is the one that runs this place is the manager Maria. She makes sure everything is in tip top shape for the Customers friendly always trying to meet the customers request also with a great o come.,1
"It's a McDonald's, there's nothing to say",1
Good food and good service. The place was packed but the staff was friendly and very well organized.,1
"I read the reviews and they were unkind, but it was conveniently located. Also, $1.00 coffee.  They have security to keep out the undesirables. Weird to see 2 security guards at McDonald's but I guess it is working. The place was clean and being able to order at a kiosk made the wait time short even during the breakfast rush.",1
Got a couple coffees they were great and they were delicious. Staff very courteous and my coffees came up quick. Felt very safe.,1
"It's a big space, it's a bit allover the place when it comes to management and foot traffic, some go to this mcd's with the intention of hanging out. The service is a hit and miss, and at times the place can be a bit dirty, but the prices r decent for the area.",1
If you are passing through and need a place to eat or you don't have time to put dinner on the table usually this is you're next option. But before going anywhere else to eat come here first. If you are looking for people who still care about there job in this day in age and are dedicated to making there service the best it can possibly be this is where you should go.,1
I love visiting McDonald's on my own or either with the kiddos  because that's their favorite place to eat...,1
"It's a nice place, clean and good service, besides they follow the pandemic rules, I'm don't like that kinda food, but my kid love it",1
I am truly loving them :D,1
"Unfortunately the covid-19 pandemic has rendered eating within mcdonalds not possible, it a rather elegant one. Clean, composed, every bit the lady and her  staff are professional.  Fast food done right . Money  low from all the shopping and touring, take swin",1
One of the best Micky Ds in town.,1
Quick to pickup when you don't have much time. The fountain drinks are the best!,1
"Quick, clean, efficient social distanced order delivery/ pick up system... excellent job and the food was fresh!",1
"Food was fresh, service was fast and it was inexpensive. Yes it is frequented by transient person's
Where would you go without a home. The facilities are kept clean.",1
Wonderfully managed McDonald's with very fast service...  I go here all the time and the staff is truly genuinely nice and friendly... the best coffee for a dollar I've ever had... and even better when somebody else brews it for you...,1
"Often busy because of the high flow of traffic in the area, but as far as a McDonald's goes it is not bad. Service is quick, prices are good, food is consistent for the most part.",1
"Oh so good at 4 am wastie was so happy that it was 24/7
Great service good taste
Thanks McDonald占쏙",1
The foods pretty good. But you have to pay to use the restroom. But the foods awsome and the ice cream machine works,1
"I go to McD because it's familiar. Even when I want to try something new, I start researching my options but in the end I can't make up my mind and I'm getting hungry so I default to McD.",1
Like there new 6 dollars menu. Affordable for those who can for now I no they r going to change it back after the holidays. But I wish they would keep it.for us low income people.,1
"This mcdonald's is excelent to observe NYC's night people. All kind of things happened in a short lapse after 11PM. Kudos to the security guard, he did a great job, he was full handed though. Advice: avoid eye contact",1
"Dnt let the long lines fool you, they move fast and efficiently.  The restaurant dining area is always clean, im not afraid to use their drink machine lol . All nyc McDonald's should follow suit lol",1
McDonalds spicy chicken sandwich and fillet o fish was delicious. Very clean and fast service.,1
The McDonald's was pretty organised. Better than some others in the US. A lot of room to sit at and clean toilets. The food was okay like you would expect from the McDonald's.,1
Love the new touch screen menus. Staff was friendly and efficient. Tables were so-so clean (had to wipe up my own).,1
Good place if you like McDonalds like our kids,1
The best street food in the nyc.  I don't know what type of Charcoal the use. But the Taste is unique. I love this  street food so much.  That  I go to after I featen from a restaurant in the same neighborhood.  The season  they put on top of the chicken thigh is to die for.,1
"Very busy site, a clean as it could be,",1
It's a McDonald's. Get's 5 stars because my order was correct (egg McMuffin no cheese). Good job :),1

The staff was fast and efficient and made sure I had the right order.,1
"Location:   Right by the A/C train line and M34 bus.  1 floor.  Clean.  Lots of sketchy individuals out front.

Service:  Always fast

Wait:   Hardly ever a long line",1
This restaurant is just near to my hotel Wingate. As usual we had a fish burger here. Service is good. Taste is okie. Mcdonald's fried is the best among fast food restaurant.,1
Nice and clean and you dont wait a long time to get your food and have z credit card session if you don't want to wait on line and more faster as well,1
Went McDonald's in Manhattan. It was excellent. The food was hot and the service was good and fast. Note 33rd St McDonald's air conditioning was broken. No problems.,1
"Just like any other random McDonald's. Good thing, there is free WiFi and the service was quick. I payed at the digital counters and like 5 minutes after that I was having my meal.",1
10/10 I was I the otel next to this MC it was awesome it was open till relly late and I could come there If the other restaurants where closed,1
A little better this time. They didn't have any homeless people inside or outside. The police was standing outside.,1
"The young lady at the drive thru is sweet and polite and does a great job in serving me hot food, I love going there at 230 am.",1
"Best Mickie D's I've had thus far since returning to the NY area, and even after I ordered a sweet tea which wasn't sweet, It was replaced with a better refreshing beverage   kudos to you McDonald's",1

Great customer service very friendly and helpful.. the managers angie and crystal also help get the food out fast and its a very clean place to eat,1
It was a fast order placing. Must of been the time I was there. It was around 6pm on a Saturday. Surprising it wasn't pack being a weekend.,1
Pretty busy restaurant but which McDonald's isn't? I order food with the app and leave happy :),1
"It's a McDonald's it won't change your life, it won't fix your car and it certainly won't give you a steak dinner. But damn if they don't have the best fries in the business.",1
McDonalds on 8th Ave & 34th st in NYC threw it down. Fresh food and fresh drinks Luke the Diet Coke wasn't flat??? Nice.,1
Was little slow but food was okay,1
"This is always been one of my favorite places, but since the renovation it is a more stylish,  user-friendly place to enjoy a delicious meal.",1
Well i like it in general . the coffee is very nice and also ice cream these are the two favorite things in MCDONALD'S,1

Good place,1
Managed a good morning crowd with good time between order and getting the meal. Appropriately polite too.,1
I love McDonald's coffee and this place has really fast service and very kind people working here...,1

Just tell them no salt on fries u can get fresh ones add ur own,1
No long wait/ Good service,1
Fast food at it's best but the amount of regular homeless people I see in the McDonald's is crazy. This location seriously needs security.,1
"A bit slow, but perfectly adequate. It's McDonald's, a chain so have reasonable expectations. They do mccafe at least",1
A major transformation every thing is new they got 8 monitors to order from plus 4 registers pretty fast  and a ATM.    Half a block from 34th with subway rite there,1

Staff that is both courteous and knowledgeable.  Food always tastes fresh. I like that they have two ordering stations so that you can still enter and exit as quickly as feasible even during busy times. I always make sure to stop by and get at least a strawberry sundae whenever I'm in the neighborhood. It is worthwhile to visit the location to acquire a snack or meal.,1
Love McDonald's. Been eating them since the Super Size days. Finally they have fresh beef burgers. Would you eat it this pink?,1
"I never dine in but if I do eat here, it is through the drive thru. They always have great customer service which is really nice. The food sometimes is not so great. Either ingredients are missing (probably do to food outage) and sometimes my food is cold which is super undesirable. This place isn't bad, it could definitely improve.",1
"Popular restaurant for people.
Location is convenient & parking is easy.
I use drive through most of the time.
Prices are a few cents than other locations in this area in some items (prices are varied with restaurant locations).",1
I like the fact it has longer hours then most of them. If only some of the employees that work drive thru were alittle more friendly. Instead of being short fused and somewhat rude.,1
Best McDonald's I've ever been to.  Absolutely best double quarter pounder I've had at a fast food restaurant. I'm beyond impressed with the speed and quality I experienced here. I bit into my burger and thought I was anywhere other than McDonald's.  I was taken back by how great it tasted.,1
"Update (12-29-2022): I visited this location again around the same time and the food was hot and fresh. Ordered 60 chicken nuggets, 2 fries, 2 large drinks, and 10 apple pies. We had to wait 10 minutes for the pies which is understandable because they take awhile and they don't usually have that many of them just sitting around.

Went pretty late at night (close to 1 AM) and the fries were surprisingly hot and my Shamrock Shake wasn't melted. I did ordered using the app and had zero issues. It was an unusually pleasant McDonald's experience and I will be a repeat customer at this location.",1
"Best and most consistent McDondals in the Bay Area. Their nuggets are always crispy, fries is always hot, and burgers are always juicy.",1
This McDonald's is always fast and polite and they always get my order right.,1
"New store technology and modern layout. Hope their food and service are at same level after the remodeling.

They forgot to replace the soda machine! Oh-ohh",1
Very good as always and all the staff are very friendly specifically the manager Maria Villaviray.,1
"I would have given 5 stars but, the lady (MNGR) that took my order got one item wrong & I did not notice until I was long gone! Also, the COVID headache is pretty much behind us but, for some odd reason this location still has a limited/restricted dining room, even to the point of closing it down completely at 3:00pm everyday! I can understand being cautious & prepared but, to use the pandemic as a way to justify limiting/restricting areas of an establishment  that we as patrons normally use on any normal/regular day is unprofessional, inconvenient & just a way for them to make it easier to keep clean & one less thing to be done when it comes to closing down for the night!
However, though this ranting & raving I am doing in this post, I still get good customer service there when I do go for a quick & easy meal! & Their drive thru is  conveniently open 24 hrours",1
"That day I brought the kids having activities in South Bay Santa Clara. After the event, I tried to bring the kids to mcd.i went two and they both closed at 6pm. At least the south city mcd dining room opens till 10pm.",1
"They did not give us straws! we had to go back through the Drive-Thru and wait in a big line of cars... has 2 lanes for ordering and was actually pretty busy. They were a the on the slow site, but we just figured it was all the people coming back to get their straws. other than that it was just your regular McDonald's experience. very grateful it was open though. since covid you don't find to many 24 hrs. locations that still actually stay open all night as hours state. That in itself is a whole different issue and honestly very difficult to figure out without driving down an unlit window on a drive-thru with a sign stating ""we're open 24 Hours.."" I gave it a 4 because food was warm and fresh, and drinks were on point except luck of a straw.",1
"Can you say fast?! Double drive through lane getting stacked, I went in instead. Dining areas closed but clean and safe ordering from counter. The guy on cashier was fast and efficient. I don't need to be treated like I'm spending $1000 so the efficient process works for me. Food was as expected for any McD's..if you have little time and crave the golden arches, this location will have you on your way soon enough.",1
Can not beat mcdonalds for their quick service and food.  Though their best menu item is still the coffee.,1
So much improvement. They're serving good fries now - newly cooked (vs. saggy and felt like microwave warmed before). Curbside pick up was so helpful. We'll comeback!,1
Very friendly and professional staff.  Food tastes fresh all the time. i like the fact that they have 2 ordering stations so when its busy you can still get in and out as quickly as possible. every time im in the area i make sure to stop by and get at least a strawberry sundae. the place is worth stopping by to grab a snack/meal.,1
"Good, fast, food. They are open 24 hours a day which is great if you are working a night shift, graveyard shift or have to go in early in the morning. Their new menu is actually quite good! I do wish the McRib was back in season but, oh well, you can't have it all! Try the Minutemaid Slushies! They are outstanding!",1
"Never had an issue. They get the orders right, and they are quick and polite.",1
"I come here a lot because I live close by. The staff are really nice people --friendly and open to talk with customers when it's not rush hour. Sometimes I stay here for an hour or two. I watch people come and go. Sometimes it's packed, sometimes it's only me with my family and 1 other person. There are a lot of seats, and there are high chairs for kids. Sucks that they cut out the power outlet a while back though. I must come with fully charged device or a power bank. \(>~<)/",1
I like McDonald's McChicken sandwiches and their Sundaes its delicious! I also like the way how they packaged their food Delivery its sealed with a security tape both drinks and food inside a secured paper bag with handles !! Best Fast food well safely secured in these challenging times when Coronavirus is ravaging our population and its health !! All fast food chains should follow McDonald's safety packaging procedures for food packaging deliveries !!,1
"- Usually fast service
- Mostly friendly customer service; some people could be more kind
- Quarter pounders always fresh
- Ice cream works 100% times I've ordered",1
"Freshly fried fries
Order ready quickly
Friendly staff",1
"The two McFlurrys that my party ordered seemed to not be whipped, which was unfortunate. Otherwise, the food was prepared quickly, even though we went during the lunch rush. Parking nearby could be full during lunch.",1
"Yep, five stars.  Not Michelin five stars but best Mickey D's I've been to in a long time.  Fresh Beef Quarter-Pounder is better than I thought it would be... And they're everywhere.",1
The only thin I can say is they need to stay up to date with the Happy Meal toys they Advertise. My kid comes in super excited to see the stand box with the Advertised toys to somet8being told the doth Have those at this time,1
Fast but the line always long and sometimes it take so long for one customer. Curbside pickup take longer than drive thru.,1
You knew it! Super cheap and decent menu. Helps feeding many who cannot afford.,1
Drive thru is always fast and on point! I have never gotten a wrong order. Thank you!,1
Open late actually 10/10 quality of life improvement moving here,1
Good ol micky D's same thing as usual nothing really changes but one thing this I've been going to this location for quite a while every morning order same thing a LARGE ICE HAZELNUT and a MED REG COFFEE  with a few fixings added most of the employees know me on a HELLO basis same for two MANAGERS there they see ME in line they make eye contact with me I shake my head get to the counter Cashier ask me the USUAL SUR i say yes and BLAM there's my two morning favorites so i go every day just to see great EMPLOYEES of this location ,1
It opens 24/7 and it's very close to where I live. I usually order from drive through. They put sugar in my coffee when I ordered black coffee. This was their only mistake I have experienced.,1
"It's fast, it's food, it's cheap. It could be better, it could be faster, it could be cheaper, but it's familiar food, and it's never terrible food, sometimes it is even good food. So if you need reasonable quality food quickly and cheaply McDonald's is your place.",1
Vegetarians like me don't have many options in McDonald's for the breakdown menu. Hence taking away 1 star.,1
Good service here and prices were affordable. Always love me some fries and the Big Mac. Mocha frappe is yummy.,1
"It's just another McDonald's lol standard food and look, no play house update 5-1-20 renovated new touch screen ordering. Improved",1
Bestest McDonald's eva,1
Definitely the best McDonald's in the area. Drive thru is usually fast and efficient. Food is usually fresh though I did get really bad mcnuggets once. I'm a regular here.,1
The drive through at this location is typically fast. Parking to dine in can be difficult due to drive through lines. Better than the average MacDonald's.,1
"I've gone to this location a few times and my fries and limo every dang time. Nuggets were fresh, but fries were a waste of money.",1
"Fast service fries were fresh, not like other mcdonalds were they use the same oil for days.",1
This is a very welcoming place. They remember their customers and their regular orders. They are mostly ready with my order before I even pay them,1
"I am just wondering why so many people writing reviews for a McDonald... Are they all the same everywhere? And who has not taste a McDonald before?

So do not expect it to be as good as a decent restaurant, but it will do when you are hungry.",1
this place has the best shamrock shakes if you go during March the shamrock shakes are amazing it's really affordable just kidding that's why it's actually pretty expensive cause it's so good but you won't regret purchasing a shamrock shake,1
"It's a McDonalds. They are all pretty similar. But, the bathrooms are clean and the staff is friendly. I find it interesting that they removed the charging stations. But, once again... McDonalds, not Starbucks.",1
service pretty good for McDonald's. I find myself going out of the way for their drive thru coz their order accuracy is on point!,1
Nice place for food and a peaceful place for some rest during a ling drive,1
Went there late at night. The food was good and hot. The people working the shift were very polite.,1
I love the sausage Mcmuffin,1
Not a lot of options to pick from but generally it was good. Fast service for drive through.,1
Good coffee late at night and honestly I go at McDonald's late at night just cuz I can't sleep and let me tell you it's really nice I mean if there is one business that really cares about having decent service late at night McDonald's would be it and I'm really glad that just about everywhere,1
Great! I'm counting calories  and the calorie content of various foods is clearly posted on the menu board. Very convenient.,1
"The best thing about this place is that it is open 24x7. But then they are slow at times also for the drive through, so I recommend to have enough time in hand.",1
Very polite drive thru folks and very efficient and prompt service.,1
"Fast and friendly service
These women can make sure your getting all that you order",1
Fish sandwich was cold and French vanilla latte tasted horrible when I went at about 1am,1
This place has that usual McDonald quality. Which isn,1
"Would have appreciated more of that awesome sauce on my 20-piece nuggets, but great experience overall.",1
"Super fast service.
Need clean tables and surrounded area.",1
"McD is best value for coffee. I tried the Big Breakfast plus coffee for $5.11, and felt that I got a great value.",1
What's the say about McDonald's wherever you go by McDonald's to default favorite True Value Meal service is always good and the food quality is always good it's not for me the price is right,1
"This McDonald's is almost always busy.  While it's not the quickest, the staff here are always friendly and there are excellent deals waiting in the McDonald's app.",1
Awhile back I made a bad review but since then major improvements to the restaurant and the service have been made. Solid McDonalds,1
"This McDonald,deserves all the stars for having a sen",1
Sometimes some employee doesn't pay attention and been standing there but no one is  coming  to help..sometimes it shows attitude too,1
"This location was fast, accurate, and super friendly. Will come back in the future.",1
Drive thru was great and the person that took the order is nice and friendly,1
"The filet o fish was fresh. Hot with a crispy rust, soft on the inside!",1
Had a large order and the staff got the food out quickly and even bundled items together to create meals to save us money!,1
"Quality of the food is lower, and prices are a bit higher. Thank you Joe Biden.",1
Well it's a McDonald's It's food about the highest quality not the best ingredients but it's food,1
Always download the app and get the deals there! The best!,1
This McDonald's is super clean and the staff is very friendly!!,1
Kiosh not available for use.  Otherwise your usual experience.,1
It Can Get Busy At Times....But It's Way Better Than It Used 2 B B4 The Remodle....This Is The Mickey Dees 2 Go 2 That's 4 Sure,1

"I used, to go here before. I was from this town. The quality. This is: good eating.",1
Great location! Always been good service.,1
"McRib came out really well crafted. No complaints, service was average.",1
Service is fast and the always correct. Not much more you can ask for from a McDonald's,1
Yes- i took a moment to rate a Mc Donalds. This is the one closest to my house and I have to say everyone is consistently courteous and professional so I want to recognize that,1

"It's a famous chain fast food.
Try to see if there is a difference with Korea
Personally, it tasted better than Korea.",1
"Due to the corona virus, we are only doing takeout.
I used to do a drive-thru.
A service where you can order on the app and pick it up at the counter seems convenient.
It's a pity that my phone doesn't support it占쏙",1
I ordered a large cheeseburger and got two cheeseburgers!,1

"Visit this place as it is close to my house. Everything is well organized and quick service. The staff are also very friendly. And the place is pleasant and clean.
Will definitely recommend it.
And also it's open 24 hours which is even better and also it has drive through.
I will be coming often every week.",1
Did drive through because of time of day (5:30am). Got the Sausage Egg McMuffin with decaf coffee. Window drive through ladies were very pleasant and polite...even brewed fresh decaf for us!! ,1
"One of my favorites places for gatherings and quick bites. They are quick, great customer service and excellent teamwork atmosphere. Keep the good work. ",1
I did the drive thru service the lady who collected the money at the window was awesome I'm so sorry I didn't get her name. She put a smile on my face.,1
"Typical McDonalds.  Good hot food, quick service and you know what to expect.",1
Well I never been to a McDonald's were they allowed pitbulls. That bark and wine for hours.. I felt not safe with a big pitbull. It was not a working dog.  They are 3 black guys hanging out talking about drugs and woman and partying and been there for more than. 5 hours I didn't see them with. Anything to eat or drink.  Just turned the McDonald's in too a hang out spot and a night club.. cursing laughing while there is child's present.. the manager is a joke... Doesn't do anything about it.,1
"I didn't t like the kiosks, I rather have someone take my order instead",1
"it's local so our most used location and it's really as you would expect with McDonald's in general. Sometimes it's great and no issues and sometimes food is a little colder than you'd hope for or missing items from orders and such. I'd say we have more good experiences than ""bad"" and 4 stars is fair.",1
I퐉 road tripping from broward and the service here is great. The cashier was beyond nice and the custodian m,1
"I like the new touch screen kiosk for placing order its Cool, play area is small but it's clean. Great staff !",1
Iam love'n it! The staff is great! Very nice people that work their! At the times when I stop by headed to Haines City to visit family week or weekends! Keep up the good work!,1
"Jose was great everyone was so nice
Place is very clean everywhere",1
"Excellent customer service.
My daughter is special needs and they went above and beyond to assist us.
They greet you and assist you with a smile and a lady was coming around asking if everything was okay and if we were happy by the end of our dinner.
They also keep it very clean and tidy.
And the food was delicious.
Five stars are not  enough.",1
Food is usually good but they mess up orders pretty frequently. My last double cheeseburger had a piece of chicken in the middle instead of beef. It'll get the job done though.,1
I some times go to this fast food place just to get my coffee fix when I feel like having coffee,1
Nice quiet time for a quick burger.  Not many people were inside but the drive thru was busy.,1
Clean and friendly service!,1
"Thanks for the perfect iced coffee I got. The price for $1.49 for a large you can not go wrong. I go here about every couple days since it is almost in my back yard. The food usually is good and service is fast. Friendly staff serving you. I am so glad that this location is remodeling the play area,So excited to see how it will look considering I can walk there in 15 min. Gotta Love It!!",1
"Can't remember the last time I was here.  Great job to them!! Not 1 issue & the food was very good!! Every employee we had contact with, very pleasant & kind. The restaurant itself, very clean. Hats off to all of you!! ",1
"Order @ the kiosk slow there DT seems to b a priority over dine in customers,I drive by the next time McDees needs to step up here!!",1
Dropped my food  as I was leaving and they replaced my order. I was so grateful. (Bag busted and food spilled out).,1
I don know who gave them less than 5 stars. But OMG! This filet o fish was cooked to order and had a perfect crunch on the crust. People who know me knows that I would not give a good review if it wasn real.  Tonight I had a taste for this sandwich so I got in my car for a late night run. I퐉 sooo surprised that this fish sandwich was sooo perfectly cooked. All was missing was a dash of a sweet seasoning salt. I wish I could tell the cook tonight well done!! We went back and got two more filet o fish sandwi,1
"This McDonald's is super fast on ordering, prep, and moving  cars thru the drive thru. Awesome in having the order prepared and correct.",1
"Stopped here after picking up my brother from school, there was a bit of a line but it moved pretty fast and the food was absolutely fantastic usually mcdonalds is hit or miss in multiple areas this location was fast service and really fresh food!!!!!",1
"The people who work here are always kind to me when I go in. The food has always been correct, and I do tend to take something off when I order the McChicken sandwiches. The only issue I have is the time period in which they only accept cash, but I do not blame them. I just don't carry cash on me.",1
"Normal fast food, service was a little slower than normal due to not enough employees on site",1
"This 1 McDonald I'll say surpasses all in Central Florida. Being a father of two teenagers who are always hungry (!) and it's very convenient for me to stop by in a McDonald to pick up some snacks (burgers...).

I always park and go inside and order. I ordered on the kiosk and a lady (manager, perhaps) acknowledged me and in 4 minutes, I got my food whereas the drive through would've cost me at least 10 minutes.
Clean, fast and friendly service!",1
"Lol I just like the guy who said my hair reminded me of someone in a movie, he was nice.",1
Great food and service!,1

"I went on Saturday to eat and I was fascinated because all the food was hot, plus the service and the speed left me speechless.",1
Fast and accurate service,1
Excellent place to spend Laayoune vacations,1
I only took one glass and it was very thick. They should make them softer when drinking it.,1
"It is the ideal place to get out of the rush for a moment, to enter and eat any of its products that are good; both in its food and good and fast in the attention.",1
"I had an excellent experience in this place, the girl who served us at night through the drive thru was super friendly and cordial, she gave us information about what we asked her and she explained everything with pleasure.

highly recommended",1
I liked this McDonald's because it has a park for the children. Little McDonald's have that,1
The milk shake is very rich. But a lot of sugar.,1
All good excellent 占쏙,1

"Excellent children's food, nuggets and freshly prepared potatoes, the milk was cold and the attention was very good",1
"The food is good, but the portions are very small for the price. The attention is good, the place clean and organized, the bathroom clean and modern. I love McDonald's!",1
"On several occasions I have gone, I bought and then I did not get what I asked for or requested and I have to exchange it for something else. They should be more aware of their inventory",1
"The food was ready very quickly, the place was super neat! The quality of the food especially the fries is excellent!",1
It is a place to take the children to have them play. They often get the orders wrong. But overall it's not that bad,1
"Beautiful and newly remodeled, really nice and the service at half speed for Covid reasons.
Recommended... ",1
Very tasty everything as always,1
The mask against the virus did not let me speak English well with the girl from the driver though up,1
I love the good attitude of the employees,1
"I ordered a big mac and it was spectacular as always, the chips were too good",1
a standard Mcdonald store... but they quickly noticed the error in the totem... there is a children's play area...,1
"Very good as always. Oh, and in the one you visit you can eat inside the premises.",1
fast here,1
"I was doordashing at the time, I would never eat at McDonald's because I'm Vegan. Just want to make that clear.
This experience was not the best demonstration of a streamlined or very efficient process in expediting fast food.

The order I was waiting on took a whooping 15 minutes and was given to someone else without an apology. That being said, I would have rated them with 1 star but I decided to walk in and watch the process.
The customer service was what I would expect given the employees having to deal with the distractions from the crowd of people inquiring about their order.

* Customers can look up at the monitors above the counter to see the process of their order.

The average gluttonous ""starving"" American that eats at McDonald's behaves as though their needs are of paramount importance. It's one of the best examples you can witness of bloated self-entitlement.
McDonald's employees, you are doing a good job and on behalf of the Jerry Springer audience members that eat at your restaurant. Please forgive them.",1
I came right at closing time and the manager took my order then when I got to the first window I was told sorry we are closed. I told him someone repeated my order and went to ask at the same time the manager came to the first window after telling his coworker the situation the manager hurry and got payment then hurried back to round up my order while everyone else was getting ready to leave he then got my order to me fast and fresh I couldn't have been more pleased with the service and the good attitude. If the workforce had more employees like this  manager the world would be a lot better place to work in,1
"The prices are better in Utah than Idaho or Minnesota. Also, the McDonald's app has great deals. If you do the survey on the recite than you get a buy one get one free discount.
Since I have frequented McDonald's for a long time, I must admit that I have mixed sentiments regarding the eatery. On the one side, the meal is typically pretty decent, and I like the quick and convenient service. However, there are some problems that I've come to realize over time that make me feel like the experience isn't as positive as it once was.

The rising costs of the products on the menu are one of my main worries. Every time I visit McDonald's, it seems like the costs have increased once again. This makes it challenging to continue frequenting them as much as I once did, especially with the availability of more economical fast food alternatives.

Another problem is that McDonald's used to give frequent and significant discounts and promotions, but lately they seem to be less frequent and generous. This is disappointing because I've always valued the ability to occasionally save a few dollars on my lunch.

Having said that, there are still a few aspects of McDonald's that I genuinely value. The majority of the cuisine is delicious and good, and the quickness of service is still unmatched. The restaurant is always spotless and well-kept, making it a perfect choice if you need a fast dinner on the run. Overall, I would say that McDonald's is still a good option for fast food, but because of the rising costs and less promotions, it has lost its place as my top pick. However, a typical McDonald's burger and fries are a great choice if you're searching for a quick and delectable dinner.",1
What is a good stop at McDonald. I don go often but when I do usually grabbing a 2C combo. Reminds me the old Californi,1
"Excellent customer service. The gentleman at the drive thru was friendly, helpful, and courteous.",1
"It was very cheap compared to what I'm used to in California. $20 can easily buy two full combo meals, likely even more.

Food is decent as expected.",1
"Tonight 02/17/23 I was in this McDonald's, things were calm and fine. Then all of the sudden, some guy started yelling at the staff about customer service. Demanding customer service number to complain. Fine, that's his right. But as the lady at the register tried to help him, he kept yelling at her. They said that he was an officer in the Army. To me, that is disgraceful and highly insulting that anyone would use rank and the military to treat people like that. I don't believe he is any sort of military let alone an officer.  And I did tell him that ""if he is a retired military officer, he is a disgrace of a former officer."" To which he wanted to go out and fight me. Furthering my belief he is no officer. I was an E-4 Specialist and know that he or any other member of any military force is trained to use rank or status as an excuse to belittle anyone. And if you do you disgrace the uniform the military and your country by treating anyone with disrespect.  I'll stand up to anyone who tries's that type of behavior.  The staff at McDonald's was doing a fantastic job, my food is delicious.  Thank you!",1
They didn't skimp on the sauce on my spicy Mchickens,1
McDonald's will always have the best fries.,1
"I show up at 10/23/2022 at 5:50 am.   The door was closed, only the drive through was open.  I was staying at a hotel and didn't have a lot of options for breakfast and didn't have a car.  The guy working their was super nice, took my order at the drive through even though I was on foot.  He was doing everything , taking orders, making the food..  McDonalds, give that guy a raise!  Thanks.",1
"Cleanliness is taken full care of here, the thoughts of the working staff are very good.",1
Went through the drive through late at night but they were super nice even though they were super busy,1
This location was surprisingly clean. Our order was made quickly and everything was fresh. It was a good stop for a quick bite.,1
Nobody spoke English well enough to get my order correct. The food sucked as did the employees who were dirty and unkempt almost as bad as the restaurant was. NEVER AGAIN!,1
"The drive thru can get backed up, but it a busy place. The parking is very strict so be careful if you퐎e trying to",1
"It's McDonald's, you know the food and taste there, it never changes",1
If you want service apparently you HAVE to go through drive through.,1
Fast service and the staff always have a friendly attitude.,1
Slow and I am no longer in the area a little after then I will be home all day but it is an apartment and if something does need to be signed for the front desk can do that any day M-S or any of the information included. I am not going on the website to be sure to send it out of state or state to send me the link and I'll get you a copy and I'll get you the money to you by tomorrow afternoon and I'll get you sick and I will.,1
"Okay I know it is McDonald's but it is a very good fast food store.  For the price, the quality is good. I also like their app.",1
It's great close to work quick and always fresh,1
"This McDonalds comes with a free homeless show when utilizing the dine in option. No purchase necessary, subject to talent intoxication levels, results may very.",1
"5 stars for consistency.  If you like McDonald's you'll like this location.  If you're not a fan, this location wont win you over, it's McDonald's.",1
Drive through only. Lines run fast. Food is fresh and Hot. Love the celebrity meals.,1
Everything was OK except all the food was placed in one bag over the top. I asked for several bags and the problem was fixed.,1
Food was good and came quickly.  Staff friendly.,1
"Had a company party here and they were very friendly about accommodating 30 of us. TBH, none of us were expecting much from the food and we were all quite surprised at how good it was. Well do this place again and also add it to our lunch rotation.",1
"While I'm there lots of wrong orders thought they won't mistake mine
Didn't find put except after I left",1
This place sucks they worrie about drive through and leave the lobby wit people wait for their food for more then 30 mins my kids were hungry gave us the wrong happy 3 times I will never go back to this one. I am givin it 5 stars jus so people will be able to see the review,1
Loved everything from the service to the food. Between the promotions and coupons I save money. The loyalty points build up then I can get a free item. Today O had a large mocha frappe. Yum,1
They are good at making McDonald's food,1
The food was good the price was reasonable and the people at the drive-thru were very kind. We got through in a reasonable amount of time. We did not use their playground this time but from past experience I can say that my little one really does like it quite a bit. To the point I can barely get him away.,1
"I do not know what it is about this location but their coffee every time I go is so damn good. Their morning crew must be fire! Not gonna lie fast service, not crazy friendly but fast and breakfast has always been in point.",1
We ordered and got it &it was hot and right,1
Literally the best mcdonalds to go to in the early early a.m. but watch out for the overcooked or stale fries. Hardly ever been there and systems updating or down so it's my go to spot when alot of places are closed.,1
Food was good for McDonalds but the crewmembers seemed a little distracted,1
"I don personally eat here, my kids eat the fires and it",1
Due to the app I had a Bic Mac with no purchase necessary. I wasn't looked down upon and was treated like everyone else. I did but a soda but still. They did not know that I was going to do that.,1
A much nicer experience than the MCDs on 900 as review 3 weeks or so ago. Staff seemed content being their and the food was cooked. No complaints here,1
"Such a great location with fast & efficient service. It was 3am when I went and I'm sure the employees were tired because it was so busy but Angel and Anthony at this location specifically were SO nice and happy. They were friendly, complimentary, and just overall made the experience 10/10. Usually McDonalds is notorious for giving sub-par experiences, but this one was incredible.",1
I love this location cuz it's downtown so it's always super quick.,1
"Placed an order in the APP, and it was ready in a timely manner!",1
Went there around 10:20pm 11/24. Was expecting old food and cold fries but was delighted to find hot fresh food. The manager on shift made sure I got all of my items. Made my night!,1
Had a great time here Maria is the assistant manager and was kind and helped me and got everything I wanted fast.,1
In that whole area that is the best McDonald's they have extremely and friendly employees there very personable. The drive-thru is very fast they are very friendly they repeat orders back to you asked if you would like your receipt ask how your day has been. The parking lot is very clean considering that that area has a lot of problems with litter. Their sodas are always refreshing and cold they don't ever taste watery. they put together their hamburgers meet me so the Patty or the sauces are not dripping or the patties falling out of the bun. I very much recommend this McDonald's than any other McDonald's in the area.,1
"Drive through only right now, but the wait was short. The cashier/order taker was efficient and friendly. McDonald's is still a great value with fun food choices. Enjoy the flavor without Covid-19 exposure.",1
McDonald's as most people already know is one of the most popular burger places. At this location service was pretty good and everything but the thing was that when we got a happy meal the box was the Eternals theme but the toy was from Encanto. I really don't know if they want to make a superhero magic mix ,1
Pretty solid McD.  This one honors the liberty card which gives a free matching sandwich with ,1
"There was a security guard here in the middle of the day on a Tuesday. Not sure what to make of that.

Food & service was fine.",1
"They have implemented the self-order kiosk machines and the newer soda dispensers with the touchscreen. Restaurant was clean and everything was in order. Didn't have much interaction with employees there but they seemed nice. Overall great experience. Especially for a McDonald's restaurant, which isn't generally somewhere you go for a good customer experience. I was pleased with my quick visit",1
"What can I say, it's McDonald's but at least when I've gotten food here is been got and as fresh-tasting as one could ever hope for with fast-food. I hate cold fries but I've never gotten any from this store. I've also never been treated poorly here so I have no complaints at all.",1
"Pretty good experience, considering I didn't buy anything this time.  Not too spectacular to get around the peeps hangin around outside for no reason... but it IS downtown... and the only McDonald's for a pretty big radius.  Inside was pretty good, with the new self-order station things.  They've recently done some good renovations.  Not too shabby, McD's... not too shabby.",1
Sometimes there a line here around the lunch over her dinner hour but they,1
Tad bit slow in drive through.  But other than that usual MC Donald's experience and consistent taste. Value for money breakfast.,1
"You guys won't believe what just happened! Hubby & I went through the drive thu. When it was time to pay, the guy told us the car ahead of us had paid for us! I've heard of these things happening, but not to us! It is December, but I have no way to tell these good people of their immaculate timing. What those nice people don't know is I'm diabetic and my blood sugar was crashing cuz my car suddenly broke down a block away. Just when the cashier told us of the kindness, the tow guy called... he was one hour early! I didn't even see what type of car the kind people drove or get to wave thanks. I must add that my fish sandwich came with the extra sauce and the French fries were piping hot. Perfect ice in the drink and the right mix, too. They even gave us extra napkins! Can I just say a very humble thank you to all involved?",1
"Newly remodeled, very clean for now. Service was pretty decent, I would say slightly better than average as far as McDonald's is concerned. I love using the app to place mobile orders, much easier that way especially during the lunch rush. Food was, well, it's McDonald's. Pretty average food too.",1
This is by far the best location in the valley. Customer service is always great. The staff is always very friendly and the wait time isn't that bad at all. I'm always satisfied with this location占쏙,1
I spend a lot of money at this location and I haven't really ever had a bad experience the only downfall with this restaurant is it states that it is 24 hours yet it is closed during hours of the night and as I just stopped to get my breakfast this morning after 6:00 a.m. it was closed again sometimes they are even closed in the middle of the day so it is not always open as stated but it has always treated me well when it comes to customer service and food quality,1
"Went at about 3 am and ordered at the drive thru. Was very impressed with their service! All of my food was fresh, and it couldn't have been a better experience. Great job!",1
"The two employees running the store the evening I went were completely overwhelmed, and yet still managed to give great service with a smile. These guys deserve a raise.",1
Ice cream cone was perfect.  MC DONALD diet coke is the closest thing to coke zero since they calibrate their machines for a perfect soda and purify there water.  THANK YOU MC'DS,1
"Always professional and quick, very convenient on the way to the highway. Do not park here if you're just going to the liquor store, i have been booted before. Still come here though, cause good service.",1
Got me a good breakfast for the whole famz for a good price. Haha and I have the app so I made enuff points to get me a free big mac haha ,1
I like the way they do the egg McMuffin with sausage here. I think it's just the muffins aren't toasted so much so they're a little softer everything else seems fresh and tasty. This one happens to have a bunch of one-way streets around it but soon as you know that you can figure out how to get in and out. Fast service in the Drive-Thru no complaints.,1
"Went thru the drive thru around 6am on a Saturday morning. The attendant who took my order was very thorough and most importantly very friendly. When I was handed my order by another very friendly attendant, my order was correct, fresh, and delicious. Best McDonald's service I have ever experienced. Thank you team for starting my morning right!",1
Friendly staff. Was even offered a position. Yet I could not accept due to my being homeless at the moment..,1
"Went here at midnight. Staff was nice, quick and effective. Long line and the staff didn't waste any time.",1
"Probably the fastest, most simple and delicious experience I have had with McDonald's so far. The management is on top of it with the system they have going. I really respect that after the many disappointments I have had with McDonald's before.  They know what they're doing at this location! It's great!",1
"They are so fast here!  I'm kind of picky, so I order my stuff without ""this"" or with ""that"" and they get it right every time and keep the line moving!  Friendly people too!",1
"The line was pretty long, but they moved us along fairly quickly. Food was warm and my order was correct. Not much else to say about a fast food joint",1
Nice new remodel. Clean and well maintained. Good food.,1
"really this is a 4.5 star review. this McDonald's is located downtown salt lake city and everyone who lives here knows that parking downtown is almost impossible sometimes. Now mind you this parking lot is massive for McDonald's. way bigger than what the store needs. so people try to take advantage of McDonald's by parking here and going elsewhere.

For those idiots that are crying about their car getting booted, they were obviously trying to take advantage - even if they were McDonald's customers. There's signs posted all over that are plain as day stating 30 minute parking only otherwise subject to getting booted or towed.  the sign also blatantly says DO NOT LEAVE THESE PREMISES WITHOUT YOUR VEHICLE. so for everyone else crying, try reading the freaking sign. You know those metal signs cost money and they weren't custom made for entertainment or cosmetic purposes. use your brains......

on another note I visited here my first time just now. food was as expected for McDonald's but it's not like a good cook could make that any better. staff was fast, friendly, and effective. And my order was accurate. -.5 a star for closing the lobby at night but once again I don't blame them. There's a lot of crazies out there especially in the midnight and early morning hours.",1
This McDonalds was the perfect way to end our night at the Quarters bar. Their staff was friendly and fast and they had the new pokemon happy meals even though we came at 1:30 in the morning. We even got the rare holographic pikachu pokemon card as a toy in the happy meal.,1
"Employees this time are little less stressed. Also the new look of the store compared with the old 200 years old one makes everything else easier, even dealing with those always non conformist customers",1
The franchise is good - Years ago when I ate there regularly - the owner would be there often - she worked onthe line and if you didn't know her you would never know.  Went back recently - I don't know if she still works in the store - but it was as good as I remembered,1
"I would love the exact location McDonald's i dined at. This one employee only seemed to be against having me eat there. The woman cashier literally did'nt want to order with the 2 for one menu sandwich deal i just recieved on on my phone. She wouldn't offer me a pen to write my code on the receipt, so i used a penny to write the code, so she tells me it's invalid, but i wrote the exact code and it looked as though i wrote in oencile. She immediately try calling security, so i asked the other employees for a manager. The manager was very understanding, and even after helped with all and left to the back, the woman tells me how this is my last order and i have 14 minutes left to eat. It was ammusing so i played the idiot customer roll. I definitely appreciate the manager's understanding for i was also a little short on exact cash, so you can already guess how the woman treated me about that. On the plus side I enjoyed my meal !!",1
"They have cleaned it up!! There is a security guard who works for McDonald's to keep the riff raff out!  Its clean, nice, and calm.  I definetly recommend going here.  There is no locks on the bathroom even.  I was impressed and will go back when I'm downtown again.",1
The girl taking my order at the counter had a few suggestions on ordering that saved us some money.,1
Orders are always accurate and well made.  I haven't usually had to wait long at the drive thru.  They are not currently offering dine-in service.,1
Loved my watermelon slush at 10 PM...thank you 24 hour McDonalds!!!,1
Ok for fast food.  Parking lot and drive thru traffic makes the lot dangerous. Poorly designed. Usually always crowded.  The worst is when they ask you to pull up to #2 window to wait for your food and then they serve 5 cars behind you while you sit there and wait.,1
"Never had a problem here except my last order, we forgot our drinks in drive through and got someone else's order, which only fed my daughter, but I'm sure it was a simple mistake to make no fus over, besides i got cereal for dinner haha",1
"Never gets my order wrong, always tastes great",1
I visited McDonald's today and got a big Mac. No complaints. The food was good and I got what I expected. The servers were courteous and I got my food fairly quick. They got me in and out. All in all a great visit.,1
"I love the dollar menu. Spicy McChickens all the way. I can get 6 of them for the price of one Big Mac. Not that I do that, that's too much. I usually get two and some sauces to add to them. Tastes great and fills me up.",1
"This location is always very busy. They are Fairly quick at serving people, but the lines are very long especially in the drive through. Staff never seems very friendly, maybe bc they see so many ppl?",1
I got a quarter pounder with cheese no one is extra pickles and it was perfect. The fries were a little bit chilled and my son it was fine.,1
Got a dozen hot chocolates to go to take to the homeless youth center and they packaged them so they were so easy to carry. The youth appreciated them. Thanks!,1
This store was ok the employees could have been a lit nicer and at least act like they was some what thankful they had a job and the food showed how the employees where acting witch was ok but now good,1
"work here... Most dont know but we have a new store manager and I hope this manager keeps everything more organized. What most people don't know is that the other manager never put the effort needed for the store, therefore most slacked off... I've worked here about 3 to 4 months and like it so far, but some managers aren't the nicest... me, I've been working for Mc'Donalds for about a year, I come in everyday with a smile on my face no matter how bad my day is. I read these reports and think "" these bad employees/managers make not only themselves look bad but me too! I will continue to have great customer service, most people get mad we take too long... the Damn store has broken appliences every week... yeah they should replace it, but won't, just keep repairing it till its done... anyways point being, very disappointing knowing we still get a bad review when I try hard to make everyone happy. Thank All y'all -Javier Elizondo",1
"Ordered ahead on the app and I could tell the staff was crazy busy but when they brought my order out the guy smiled, apologized for the wait and was great about the whole situation.  Thanks!",1
Friendly staff and nice atmosphere.  Nice garden out front,1
"I got delivery and it was weird, he didn't follow directions. But that's not McDonald's fault. The food was great! :)",1
"I was thinking oh just micky d's sound ok maybe ill get a mocha frapee, went inside instead of drivethrew... Anyway was blown away to see everyone ordering themselves from a touch screen.... They had four stations and were very easy to use was also very satisfied with this particular locations quality",1
"Good location, fast service, fresh fries...good job guys",1
Great customer service. Even with it being lunch hour downtown. Worker's were cordial and efficient at getting the job done. Literally were in and out.,1
"Its pretty good for a Mcdonalds. Most of them won't serve me cookies when it gets late but this one never fails.
5 stars for cookies because those are some good cookies",1
I Really Like Their Sausage Egg N Cheese McGriddle Breakfast Sandwiches!! YUMMY!,1
"Had to wait for RESTROOMS. When I got in the men's room was clean, well stocked with soap and TP. The rest of the restaurant was clean and the staff was good to me.",1
I like McDonald's cuz it's quick and it's easy for me and I always get my orders right and they're very fast food is not bad it's pretty good sincerely wrapping me Daniel Robert McDaniel.,1
Makes good chocolate chip frappes and orders are usually correct. Sometimes the people that take your order through the mic in the drive through are uncaring and depressing and sometimes they are friendly,1
"Crazy fast, very efficient, and food was actually somehow fresher than most McDonald's locations.",1
I was raised up on the west side my hole life and this is my home  I have never left my phone updates so I can visit the store to get anelised my i,1
Food is edible when they get my order right. 95% of the time my order is not right. But don't get me wrong.i like the food that's why i go back even tho they get my order wrong.,1
"My wife and I wanted some soda at nearly midnight. McDonald's was open, the soda was cheap, and the person (who had maybe a Thai accent) was nice despite the lateness of the hour.",1
"I'd rate it four stars like I did with In-N-Out. For the price, the food is good and I'm definitely grateful that McDonald's exists.",1
Always good and this location is open for drive through 24/7. We ordered a 2 cheese burger meal and a fish sand meal. It was very good.,1
"This particular McDonald's had a hobo chilling in there. He asked for a sandwich and I got him a sausage McMuffin. Then this punk decides that's not enough and steals my buddy's order. How messed up is that? Like I get you're hungry, but so was my friend.",1
Great place to get some food. Really long line but they did their best to catch up on orders.,1
"The McDonalds is fine, they got our large order correct and everything tasted fine, just in kind of a sketchy neighborhood. Look out for creepy dudes talking to themselves, they might punch your car.",1
This McDonald's is the best in the world. Super clean friendly service and tasty food makes this place a great place to take your family.,1
Pretty much same experience that u will find at all other McDonald's food is fast staff is compliant bathrooms can be hit or miss good thing is breakfast is served all day now and large drinks are still one dollar,1
"They had those cool self order things. They weren't super responsive though and it was kind of annoying. Everything else was good, or at least normal for McDonald's.",1
"Order via the app, it is the best! There are all kinds of specials every day. This McDonalds was nice and speedy.",1
Very quick service at a busy time of day,1
This place was really fast for going in later at night. The food was awesome and they got the order correct.,1
"Thanks for the free order of French fries. Remember to get the $1.00 any size of French fries. If you have to wait till they are ready you can ask for a free desert, or. Free drink.",1
The customer service is a lot better then the McDonald's off of 3300s.,1
Super quick super clean super friendly staff love this restaurant the children's area is always clean great prices great location in don't have one negative thing to say about this McDonald's,1
Ordered 2 sausage McMuffins and a large drink. McMuffins were cooked good and not burnt on the edges. Not bad,1

Always have a pleasant experience at this McDonals drive thr,1
"Busy Saturday morning and we were helped quickly. Our order was out quick, hot, and accurate. Great place.",1
Though there may be a wait at times the staff here are friendly and take that extra moment to make sure everything is made right. I can tell that it's a very stressful job so I respect those willing to make my food for me when I don't want to do it myself.,1
Really nice very complex but simple ways to order friendly ppl  great place to eat I think it's the best with the new technology 5 * all the way,1
"Back, for more! Ba, Da,Ba...Da, Da-I'm lovin' it! So should you!",1
Great service and clean establishment. Fountain soda machine didn't work properly during my visit and got just syrup.,1
Best McDonald's I've had in a long time.,1
"Right in the heart of Salt Lake City, so it's super busy, but it still goes at a good speed.",1
"Super busy, but moved everybody through the line like a boss, food was good and hot.",1
"They provide me burgers at 5am for those early mornings, and 2am for those late nights. The employees are nice.",1

Always fast no matter what location.  The food is always consistent.  The classic taste of McDonalds never gets old to me!,1

The only draw back was that their dine in closes at 8pm,1
Super quick and correct even with modifications.,1
Its clean,1
There ice cream machine was working atc1:30 in the morning!!,1
Food is usually pretty fresh at this location. Make sure to check your order when you use drive thru,1

Clean and the staff was awesome. Food got to us quick... Note to customers the Restrooms lock,1
The Big-Mac is better than ever.  And the Junior Mac is great. You gotta love it.  Food is consistent at the 90th South location.,1
They've made some improvements.  The help is friendly.  You still have to keep an eye on your vehicle though.,1
This McDonald's is the best one in the area. It is always pretty clean and always good service. They can be quite busy sometimes though.,1
Very fast service; and some workers are very friendly!... Sometimes Filipinos don't care about the customer service side.,1
"Service was kinda fast, employees seem to have attitudes tho. Bathrooms were clean too.",1
I enjoy their pancake breakfast. It's McDonald's what more can a person say? You either like it or you don't.,1
These guys were on fleek!!,1
"Sorry, but McDonals you're sooo prone to messing up orders...",1
Their 2 for $20 and 3 for $10 deals are INCREDIBLE!!! That's all my family gets when we go.,1

"I placed my order on a screen in the store. It was very efficient. The staff are very friendly and helpful. However, you find a lot of people hanging around the place because of a liaison office of one of the Latin American countries. The environment is somewhat sombre. Other than that we had a good meal.",1
What a great experience at 1:30 on a Sunday morning. Tons of people hanging out and having a late night snack. Place was clean. Food and service was prompt.,1

This location has Rocket the racoon if you're collecting them.,1
"Clean, plenty of places to sit and enjoy your meal.",1
It was good service I was visiting with my husband this McDonald while I was waiting for my husband next ,1
"From a quick visit about 4 months ago:

Dining room was small, seemed clean (my order was to-go so didn't spend much time inside).

Loved the digital menu/self-order kiosks (ordered at the kiosk and it still gave the option to pay cash at the register, though not sure if that option's still available and/or if the dining room's even open right now...?).

Staff was friendly enough and very helpful, packed my to-go order like absolute pros.

The area where the fountain drinks, straws, etc., are wasn't super tidy (a bit of a spill on the countertop, if memory serves); however, seemed clean, otherwise.

Because it was such a quick trip, didn't get to see the condition of the bathrooms (a good indicator of an establishment's working and overall conditions, in my experience). Maybe another time?

Overall, a good experience.

Something to consider: there's no drive-through nor a parking lot and finding a parking space seems to be a nightmare/hit-or-miss in that area. Circled the surrounding blocks a few times before someone parked almost right in front of the store just happened to be leaving (not sure how often that happens, though). Score!

The previous parking spot I'd found was about 2 blocks away (doable), but kept searching in order to be closer to the other establishment my group and I were visiting prior to McD's.",1
"Checkout from the cashier was fast and accurate. The place was clean, and has M/F bathrooms that we're about as clean as I'd expect from here. Menu was clear and expansive. The staff was all very friendly. Seating inside was plentiful. Food was as expected.",1
Great place to grab something quick to eat. Its worth more then the other fast food restaurants. I've been eating more here than the other fast food restaurant. I really love this food. Thanks for all the hard work keep a lot of us happy,1
"Stopped by for breakfast a few times while in town.  Self order kiosks were great but didn have directions, I ordered without issue but watched a few people walk out after not being able to figure it out and having",1
"Love going here, fantastic staff, clean restaurant and never have they ever messes up my order!",1
It was clean and well maintained. Service was also good.,1
"Great place, not a long wait for your order even in rush hour",1
Love the food and service,1
"I charged up on sausage biscuits before filming the dcmj joint share at DuPont circle during the inauguration. Had a good talk with Trump supporters. They were pretty feeble minded, but decent folk I guess. I bet our interaction would have been different if I was a brown person though.",1
"This McDonald's was so hi-tech I was unsettled. You order from machines and put your card in that way.
Like all Mickey D's, the fries are only good for about 7 minutes before they're cold and soggy. Shovel it all in before it all feels gross.",1
Food was great but 15 dollars for breakfast (for one person). Wow!,1
"You guys do have mocha coffee, right? Cause sometimes ya'll think I'm talking about a frappe. And then I give up and ask for a regular. I mean I don't really care, but sometimes I suspect I'm being gaslighted. Like you guys know something that I don't. You know what I'm saying?

Where you keepin the mocha man",1
It McDonalds. What do you expect? This one seems to be quick and accurate with orders and I,1
The beat Big Mac ever!!! My McDonald's app was acting stupid but I received my order and it was great,1
The McDonalds on M Street is newly renovated and spacious.  You place your order on touch screen and take a table number and the food is delivered.  How about that fast food that is that and convenient.  BTW THE MCRIB IS BACK!!!!,1
"I like that they have the kiosks here. Easy, no annoyance orders.",1
Went in around 10pm on a Saturday.  Not too crowded.  Quick service.  The new BBQ tenders are on point!,1
Not for me macdonald's but granddaughters loved ordering on screen,1
After spending top dollar on fancier dinning establishments it was nice not to have a meal run me over $150. They also signature sanwhichs which are quite tasty!,1
"The right place to eat when I have no time and want good tasting food, I had Caramel Iced Coffee and I ordered a Big Mac, the girl suggested that I can get one extra Big Mac for a minimal amount, it was almost free, it was a good decision.",1
Loved my strawberry shake but no bathroom for the customers wow I came way from Hampton  Va,1
Service was good and fast. Store was clean and nicely update.,1
"The hamburgers are the best. Not too gamey, full bodied with a hint of sage. Fresh toasted bun with a generous helping of an exciting combination of garden vegetables.",1
Very kind and pleasant staff members. Much Cleaner than other local McDonalds franchise locations.,1
"The foods greatly improved in flavor and price with the new 1,2,3 menu but if there is a Wendy's nearby you should go to that instead.",1
"Always  great food and lots of choices.the people  2ji work  here are nice,  helpful and friendly.   Food is fresh  and delicious.",1

"Fast service, typical McDonald's food. A bit dirty ",1
Nothing exceptional compared to France. Almost the same choices. Do not come to the US to discover extraordinary things at mcdo,1
"Not very good attention from the employees of the place. One of the employees who was serving me spoke to me in a way that was not very well seen on my part. When I got there, she looked like I was a beggar, because I was working and decided to go eat. However, the employee said as ""yes, what will you want!"" No! No! No! But in a disgusting way. But I ignored him and left the place. In addition, the restaurant has a second floor for those who are not in a hurry to go for lunch, breakfast or whatever. There is something very good about this place is that there are staff who speak Spanish and English. This place is also extremely close to the Honduran Embassy. I recommend this place.",1

Clean and relaxing to hang out at non peak hours. Stopped to get my son a Happy Meal here and rest while shopping at Macy's. Worth it.,1
Adam is the most sincere employee an was moving fast an efficient. He should be the manager. The manager was slaking the night I was there. The place is never cleaned an Adam Rodriguez was the only one to take the initiative to clean the garbage an the floor.,1
"A cool little get away spot in the city when you need that FREE WIFI and also $1 coffee.  I love it.  The staff are not too welcoming, but they are in the center of traffic with people shopping and across the street from Madison Square Garden...But I still like the location.  Check it out.

Eat, Play, Shop...
Live Life Unscripted",1
"This McDonald's is not a place where romances go to begin, nor to thrive.  This McDonald's is where romances go to destroy themselves, one urine-scented moment of heartbreak at a time.  No love has ever grown here.  Nothing, in fact, has ever grown here.  Plants wilt.  Children become stunted.",1
Nice location at an upper floor inside Macy's. Good for tired famished shoppers. Take the window seats and get a good view of New York below.,1
The cashiers are very nice and the place is comfortable. It's a great place to interact and the food is what is expected of Mc Donald's.,1
"Having good experience on my recent visit, crews are friendly and helpful. At least the crews that had talked to me.",1
"I stopped by on the way to work and I was very pleasantly surprised!  The staff here was not only 5 out of 5 on all things hospitality, but the streaming classical music added to their warm and peaceful environment.  Well done,  McDonald's crew at this Los Alamitos location; well done, indeed! :)  ",1
Second position review . Best cups of coffee served here n cookies are fresh n the chicken nuggets extra crispy . Come check them out.,1
"Came here to eat and although it was packed, had a great experience.  The staff were very friendly/attentive and clean overall.",1
This McDonald I believe this was the one down in La they are always so nice I don't even eat McDonald's right now but my uncle eats it and I go there for him to get his breakfast sometimes he likes it and they're so nice,1
They were calling numbers out of sequence and I had to wait additional ten minutes as I watched other people get there before me and they ordered way behind me I won't be going back to that one ever again.,1
Weird to review a McDonald,1
Typical McDonald's food service is ok not the worse to be in dtla atmosphere varies since the security takes care of business.,1
The breakfast at McDonald's is always a hit. The pancakes are fluffy and the sausage is juicy.,1
This is a very nice and clean McDonald's with very fast service and now you can fill your own soda which is a bonus. Thanks Ronald. 占쏙,1
"The food was good and fast, Dine-in a bit noisy lol",1
He told us we have to go back around to order a Coke and then they forgot one of my frappuccinos but the wine was out and down the street in LA I called the manager over she took care of it right away at least the frappuccino I didn't worry about the soda my honey didn't need one anyways bad for you but every non-stop there everything was fine and it was up to par,1
"Good, fast and great workers! But sketchy people around due to the greyhound, and local bums.. But they do have top flight security around, so all around ok",1
Very small McDonalds with security and nice staff.  Bathrooms are accessible and clean. Primarily a drive thru though,1
"The McDonalds at this location served our order quickly and right off the grill. The staff was aloof and incapable of paying any attention to the customers in the dining area. I had to request napkins as they forgot to give them. They gave me two. I had to ask again later during the meal and again they gave me two. But on the third trip I would  hope te wpuld givenl me four, no onlyntwo.",1
"Food is good, staff is nice. It's still drive thru only with no explanation. Drive thru is fast with two lines. Convenient for travelers of Greyhound and city line.",1
"The food was fresh, it was surprisingly clean, very friendly.",1
Wow the service is great the speed n the food quality.  100% I've visit 3 times in the last month. Same experience all three times. Thank you.,1
"Good customer service, fast service and very patient.",1
"The difference in taste of the meat from the Big Mac to the quarter pounder was astronomical. Like it didn't even come from the same type of animal! So will not be doing the Big Mac again. They were fast and they were friendly, but still McDonald's.",1
"Update: give a raise to the cashier and everyone who taking out the trash in this heat!

Always empty in the morning which is good if your in a hurry , also staff is super friendly",1
"Ronald McDonald must of had a store meeting with their employees....BIG IMPROVEMENT ! Hot food ,good service , CLEAN dining room and no more bad attitude make McDonald's great again",1
"Wow what a McDonald's! This one has all of my favorite McDonald's menu items, like cheeseburgers, double cheeseburgers, Chicken McNuggets, Big Mac, milkshakes... My gosh they have got it all. Oh yeah, they have French fries, too! And milkshakes which taste exactly like McDonald's milkshakes. I expected that they would but you know it's always nice when things go according to plan. In conclusion, if you are ever in the mood for McDonald's food, then this location will fulfill that need A+!",1
It's not your typical McDonald's. They're over price on their menu plus they do not accept coupon or does any special like regular McDonald's. I think they feel the need to make their money from the Disneyland patron and it's ridiculous toward the regular customer's but it's all boil down to make money. Sometimes they can be rude toward the black customer but what to expect from seeing who goes into this franchise. Most of the customer that goes into this store are traveller which is mostly Caucasian,1
I went for breakfast it was wonderful,1
"Really good, when I ordered & paid for an espresso shot but they were out of it(",1
"If you are visiting this particular McDonald's you'll notice that you are very nearly in the middle of the strange no-man's (or woman's) land encompassing skid row and the new upwardly trendy lofts and shops that seek to define Download Los Angeles. This McDonald's manages to straddle this uncomfortable melange quite nicely. The inside of the restaurant was bright and clean. The counters looked new and the menu sign actually was orderly laid out with sensible photos next to the main items. I don't eat fast food often and the overhead menus always confuse me with ""super"" this and ""extra large"" that... I know that I am not getting the best price - ever. But this menu seemed far simpler, we ordered and our food was served quickly (with my special request done just right). We ate in and the table was clean as was the floor. It's true we were approached twice by people asking for money, but they were not intrusive and I had the feeling the manager and staff were well aware of who was in the restaurant and I didn't feel uncomfortable at all. The staff was so attentive that for the first time I actually filled out the online survey just to compliment them. That's quite a compliment in itself coming from me.",1
"It's a nice place, I have not dined in. But even when the line looks long during the morning I can honestly say that they provide a faster service to get you out ASAP!!",1
Fast good customer service,1
Quick fresh food! Stop here every time I hop on a greyhound,1
"The food at this location is usually hot and fresh. Services usually quick. Today however my breakfast sandwich had a lot of egg shells in it. That doesn't usually happen, but you still have to be careful nonetheless",1
The food was good 占쏙,1
Walked up to the drive thru window and the two ladies were very courteous and polite. I almost flirted but it was too early for that at a lil after 5 am walked from the greyhound station and ordered hot caramel macchiato killing ng time till my bus leaves.,1
"The staff is very friendly , and helpful which is hard to come by at a McDonald's . This place has had the best service out of any I have ever been to.  Thanks for the great service.,",1
I just want to say that the level of customer service provided to me this evening by Orlando and Enrique was absolutely amazing they really care about their is wanting to just throw food in the bag it's another thing to give hot food in an experience I thank you,1
I absolutely never eat fast food but I couldn't find parking in little Tokyo and made one wrong turn then ended up within view of the golden arches. I then proceeded to order an oreo mcflurry. It was satisfactory.,1
"I love that there's never a long line,and I can order and it be ready nice and fresh and fast!",1
"Super hectic and busy! Yet despite that, the staff were very friendly and kept their cool. If you go there and it takes a little bit to get your food? Chances are they're swamped, so give em a break. Yeah?",1
"Car ordering not so great. Walk in was quick, and especially clean all around.",1
"Ver small dinning area, most orders to go, many people who are traveling by greyhound go for last meal before leaving town.",1
"It was great other than the soda options weren't the best not much to choose from should definitely have root beer as an option, I think they should get the new touch screen soda dispenser there that had plenty of soda options to choose from would be very nice.",1
"Told them tonight to make my 10 chicken nuggets ""made to order "" and Bam !!! Had the best ,hot, juicy, crunchy and tender nuggets I've had since this pandemic started.  Woooooooo hooooooo . F#$king bomb diggity.  I took the previous ""3star"" I gave 8 months ago and turned it to 5 stars only because I got what exactly I asked for .lol ... I tip my hat off to you night staff for the execution delivered.  Like Arnold Schwarzenegger once said ... ""I'll be back "" I'm Jason Morimoto and this statement is true.",1
Drive thru multiple times after midnight and they know you. All my extras are now pretty much already in the bag. Don't have to ask anymore(for the most part) ,1
Always love me some McDonald that place is good no matter w,1
Everything went quickly done was well.,1
Great discounts on big macs,1
Best McDonald! Their soda is the cleanest. Al,1
"Fast customer service.
Manager is friendly. They treat homeless with equal respect. Thumbs up for that! Fries were not as good as I expected. Thats why I give 4 points.",1
Good morning how are you the court orders as here by the Jan Richardson from the Ronald McDonald House which is the control of infectious disease for Nevada returns to Department at the health department she turns it all her certification cards and she surrenders she's never allowed to work in health which human services can only be attached to a volunteer program meaning she cannot access databases she can be a friendly warm but she cannot use anybody's information that mean she's not allow cheese no computers or cell phones or telephones for her safety and the safety this date she turns over her rights as he and she is now a volunteer for the states that way she'll stay alive and live a lot longer and she'll never play with the Northside have a great day and God bless you guys bye bye release everybody holding have a good day bye,1
One of the only McDonald's that get my order right. They are always super nice. My favorite location.,1
Is my favorite restaurant ,1
"I don't love it. It's an unfortunate weakness in my DNA that I can't be hungry. I was a hungry child and find myself eating fatty foods just to feel full longer. I know it's bad. It's only a convenience to go to McDonald's and it's cheap. I will try harder to be organic. It's what I dream of. Gold? No. I'm more of a silver lady. Arches? Again, No. Absolutely nothing memorable about MO. (Misery)",1
They was nice but no more $1.00 food on the menu I was not very happy about this with me living on a goverment check so I don't have to much money when I was told that they stoped the dollar menu so with me not having to much money I got some thing to eat no I wouldn't go back to no McDonald's because of no more dollar menu I will be going to like Burger King they have a dollar menu or Jack In The Box the meal are a lot cheaper than McDonald's I think they lost their minds not having the dollar menu no more other than that they was very nice because I'm in a power wheelchair,1
I've never actually gone inside this location but I use the drive thru fairly regularly. It's a pretty busy spot but even before they put in the dual-lane ordering system the service was always quick.,1
Food is always hot the servi  ce is good never had to complain been going there for years,1
"Had the mcdonald's egg, sausage cheese meal, along with my girlfriend for a quick breakfast before heading home from L.A to San jose, it hit the spot since i was in a hurry!",1
They order for you on the touch screen if theyre busy. The only McDonald's I tried where their hash brown didnt come out hot and fresh! Very disappointed and will not order breakfast at this location!,1
They cool no handle picking up from they me.,1
Stopped for a quick meal in between bus stops.  They provided quick service and thankfully no errors on the food order.  Appreciated that the diner was relatively clean.,1
I tried curbside delivery using the McDonald's app and it worked. The only problem is that there are only 2 delivery spots and regular eat-in customers park in them. That defeats the purpose. Inside the place was clean and there are 2 self-service ordering kiosks.,1
Great service. The only reason it is 4 and not 5 ia because of the homeless people who are never satisfied. If you give them a dollar they ask for another one. If no money is available then they ask for cigs. If no cigs are available they ask for food last. Im getting tired of it.,1
Good Big Mac and fries.,1
"My go to place where I can have my all time favorite cheeseburgers, fish burger and mocha frappe are just a few..and it's close to where I am so it's always best in McDonalds wherever you may be. And of course it should be.",1
"Really enjoyed everything about this establishment. Orders are rapid fast and accurate.I had 2 ice cream cones, but I was paying attention to everyone andwhat they were ordering and minimal complaints",1
"I've always loved McDonald's food, as long as it was prepared correctly. Not all locations taste the same. This location is one at the top of the list for great food, friendly staff, clean restaurant/bathrooms.",1
"Coffee was great, and oatmeal was great. But small portions of the large 占쏙",1
"This downtown McDonalds was a surprise.  I wanted coffee before work (first time in this area) and saw it up the street.  Friendly, professional employees and a clean well maintained calm atmosphere.",1
"I always love going home to LA and visit this McDonald location. The food is always fresh, hot, and served quickly. This is my favorite go-to spot when I was a child back in my ho",1
"This is where I go to get my morning crack (frappuccino). Very friendly staff. Sometimes its hectic,  because of the area and the locals. Also lots of customers. Even  then it's a fast trip, in and out.",1
This place is very nice! The stuff is awesome! My kids were very picky about their food but stuff did a great job! It is very clean place and friendly atmosphere!,1
"Went they drive thru, although they couldn't make my food the way I normally get it, the service was very good. Fast and friendly,food was neat and will made.",1
"Holy wow! The lattes here are super delicious!

Spanish latte - creamy but not milky latte with a hint of cinnamon that isn't overpowering!

Lavender matcha latte - strong matcha flavor that compliments the lavender. It's not milky at all! I really like floral matcha",1
"Always loving McDonald. Even it was super busy, all staffs were calm and helpful. Nice cold inside even had to wait to get seat. Food was great & fast.",1
It's a good place to talk,1
"I super love the McDonald Cheese Burger. I'm always satisfied with McDonald's Cheese Burger & Chicken, and of course the fries.

Staff are very accommodating, will surely back here again 占쏙",1
Please fix that toilet door!,1
"Great fast foodie, we all know mc Dee's.",1
Service is good and it was finally remodeled. Its right near the grayhound bus station. With the area on its way to transformation as well as the arts district right there none of these artsy restaurants can replace Mc Donald's ever  .,1
"Good service,  helpful with my order when I have order a double quarter pounder with an extra patty and at first I seen two and I ask the cashier which was very respectful and helpful for me to have a smile while I ate my meal,

Thank you MC Donalds",1

"McDonalds is my favorite place for the frappe and the fish burger, cheeseburger, nuggets, breakfast is simply the best for me... they have the sprite, the new flavor  which i love and a couple of stores i find sold... so its an institution here in america and McDonald's is 1 of those Mr. Trump likes ...",1

Pretty quick and orders I've gotten have never been wrong and fries always hot.....,1
Homeless around this one.  It's downtown LA. Order was correct. Same great taste. Screen is broken in drive thru.,1

It's ok I mean the food is tasty but I love my childhood memories that I made at McDonald's that's why I give it 5 stars,1
Mc Donald's has been a favorite of mine to eat filling meals  and a few salads selections.usualy a kids play area and the serves salads and dessert. They stop serving breakfast at 11am.,1
"Too bad they were out of the new spicy sauce for the spicy nuggets, but still good service.",1
"Even during their construction, they still did a good job by serving the customers with excellent service in adequate amount of time.",1
They accommodate UberEats by having the third window so we avoid the long drive thru line after 10pm.,1
Good food and good service but I wish they served milkshakes 24/7 like they do everything else.,1
"Perfect for when you need a quick bite in between shopping in the Garment District and or Jewelry District! Fast, drive thru, plenty of parking!",1
"Good experience, ready to take my order as soon as I walked in the door and explained the different specials as advertised.",1
"""Good place ,service was very quick ,yummy food .Highly recommended!!""",1

This place is clean they have security do to homeless people like that they don't let them in the store,1
picking up food for another saying that I do not eat McDonald's because of its history with human flesh being found in 75% or so of their storage facilities but besides that yeah could service,1
The employees were a little distracted by each other but the service wasn't too bad.,1
"Clean, friendly staff, halfway clean bathrooms, not a great area though....food was fresh though just fyi. :)",1
Some of the staff can be rude and unprofessional.  But most of them are great.,1
Food took awhile to come out. Also very few tables available due lots of people having coffee at a 4 person table.,1
"It is no longer the fast of the fast foods, or the appearance of the advertising. It has become a car factory that spewks out so called food",1
Always can rely on McDonald's for some quick and fairly inexpensive good food.,1

Mc donalds is all ways a classic 10/10,1
"Very poor customer service on the part of the cashier. She ignored me while i was making a query and showed absolutely no remorse. Some people need to learn manners.
Also the self service kiosk does not give you a recepit. So you have to remember your order number.",1
"This McDonald's is located on the corner of Washington Avenue and Lincoln rd. Ordering is easy, and the staff are pleasant.  The restrooms always have a long line and they are not very clean. Great location for hungry shoppers!",1
Fast service.   Food was as expected but not enough ketchup on the burger  .  No dine in atmosphere with plastic wrap over the dining tables. It's time to get over fearing th,1
"Everything in south beach Miami is super expensive. So when it came to breakfast the crew who rode down with me ate at the Catalina. The first thing I said is where is mickey D's?
And they delivered. Not to the hotel, but delivered on that good low price.",1
"This McDonald's is a little run down, but if you use the APP to order it takes no time to pick up food and leave.",1
It's a gritty part of Miami Beach but the staff work hard to service the varied clientele.,1
"Food was great, service as well, atmosphere lacking",1
Miami mcdonald > any other mcdonald,1
I had a coupon for a free MC ribs with the purchase of a sausage egg n cheese mc griddle and two Big Mack's.  We didn't get none of that anyway.  We got other stuff instead of popcorn.,1
Although honestly not the healthiest food to eat when not able to go find a healthier restaurant sometimes due to time and or money. It's what I had to eat today. !,1
"Good place to eat quick, who doesn love a McDonald? Was a bit confusing with the table number on the self service machine when it didn go to our table number so had to stand in the que instead. No receipt, you were only aloud to be in there for 30 minutes especially how busy it was it didn",1
"Staff rude. But in a central location. Always busy. Shows 24 hours operational. But when i reached at 5.45 am, they stopped me and told tomcome back at 6 am. Nut they opened after 6.15 only",1
Lots  of homeless people using it and asking for money not the best atmosphere,1
"Nice Mcdonalads, busy, but I got food very, very fast. I reccomand if you want a quick bite.",1
I went twice when visiting and had no problems. I really enjoyed t being right next to the shopping strip. I highly recommend for those who come really early.,1
Service slow. Good salty,1
They actually had a working McFlurry machines and the food was good,1
"Gotta Love how you pay for your food and the employees act like they are doing you a favor when you ask for your own coffee to be handed to you several times like if I'm asking for something free. SMH. And don't ask for condiments like salt or jelly they really get annoyed, nasty attitudes and all. Sad how one rotten employee spoils it for the rest of the environment.",1
"Quick service for a line of people for breakfast!!! Atmosphere not the best, many people asking for money inside and outside of stablisment",1
"Although listed as open 24 hours, I arrived at 6:15 am on a Friday and was told they are closed and would open at 7:00 am.
Passed by Thursday and it was also closed at 6:45.
Definitely not 24 hours. It'd be nice if they posted their hours on the front door.",1
It always busy and especially pick up window,1
"Pretty funny,  only in miami you get guava paste and cheese pieat McDonald's, im use to get apple pies at McDonald's in the midwest.",1
Best place to get a cheap breakfast in Miami.,1
The store was very busy and full of customers. I didn't like the way they greet the customers and the way they talked to each individuals. It was busy and that can't be an excuse for bad service. Food was great as usual but service gotta improve by mile. The cleanliness was an issue also as there were napkins pretty much all over the place. I guess it was not cleaned since evening. May be business is the priority which is not what Mc does I believe.,1
"Shocking that in the center of a tourist attraction where every restaurants is 4x the price with 20% tax and added gratuity, this mcdonalds was priced just like the ones at home.  Dollar menu and all.  No, it's not the best food but you gotta give em props for not triple pricing and ripping off tourists.  It's weird they had triple cheeseburger",1
I like this McDonald's because it has delicious food and quick service.,1
"Rude staff, great burger.
The ladies at the counter were rude, bored, not smiling, very unpleasant welcoming. They should not be hired for hospitality businesses.
The bacon burger was great, hot, tasty crunchy. One of the best. Good job the kitchen.
Only an old white lady was smiling at the front.",1
"Good price,chek the food for one,two tre dollar,always find chip for that money ..",1
Clean and fast service,1
This location is always good....because its in the heart of tourist location the food is always fresh and hot. Its now a hang out spot all the tourist and locals and decor is nice. They have soo much seating and its really spacious. Ive been ordering the same thing for years. The quarter pounder with Mac sauce,1
Very clean and not too busy for a tourist town. Food was good but the staff could be more approachable.,1
The service was good but there was this 1 weird guys that was asking for money to buy a sandwich to eat which I had no problem giving him $3 and the other guy going in and out and sitting down together with the guy asking for money to eat a sandwich and asking out for 1 or 2 lucy (in case for those who dont understand its cigarettes). The managers should be putting additional people at the register for them to see thilese things because the look on some customers where not comforting with the situation.,1
"I really do not even like McDonalds... but, despite extremely crowded, here I experienced was the best service I've received in South Beach. The only attentive person I met at that region was this McDonald's attendant!!! The sandwich and the rest of the experience was exactly the same as here (BR).",1
"I like the braveness & curiosity of Mac to try the automated standing servers!  :)
I do not care if the idea worked or not, but he took the risk! That is what business is all about!
Okay guy, nice location next to the touristic places of Lincoln Rd & Washington Ave.  I gave it 5 stars because they deserve it , if u compare this location to others & to other fast food places. Super clean regardless of the homeless community in SoBe.",1
Well the Chicken Burger & Beef Burgers & Fries were the best we've had. The Milkshakes are the most delicious ones we've ever had with all that cream on the top Yummy,1
"I am a big admirer of Bear Freaks doing man vs wild in Discovery channel. From his program I have learnt about Everglades. Maybe I would think I would never visit this place. But it just happened without giving a thought to it. So, obviously I loved it. I believe nobody would disagree who visited this place already.",1
Good drive through service. And the tell-tale fish filet sandwich was cooked perfectly.  I would ask people leaving the drive through to NOT come back out onto the 16th street because it causes havoc at that light.  Please follow the signs around to the left.  It's not that far out of you won't have to be rude and prevent people from turning right on red.,1
"I normally do not eat fast food, but I stayed out late and placed an order at 4:30am. The service was fast and friendly. The food came out correct, hot, and fresh. Overall great experience.",1
Known as the homeless McDonald's. There kinda slow and really English dosnt work well here. But generally all you would expect from McDonald's. Service is slow.,1
Very good,1
Fast and efficient staff.,1
Great place & great prices.,1
Clean rest rooms I,1
"The wait in the lines was a turn off but it's understandable because of it's location, there's a high demand because people seek fast food, something fast to eat. Just like any Mcdonald's location the meal will fill you but you may want to take it to go if you die for those peaceful eats.",1
"Food amazing. Prepared quick and fresh. Everything was sooo good. Burger fresh, fries fresh and hot...Reminded me of McDonald's food from the 90's...",1
Place was very busy and it takes me a long time to take my order,1
It's nice. The automated ordering machines has a cash payment option but it doesn't work. The menu is fantastic. Lots of options.,1
"Despite it being rush hour in Miami Beach, the place didn't seem dirty nor the restrooms. The is no parking near the McDonalds so you'd have to find a way to park yourself. Customer Interaction was minimal, which was good(for me), because this McDonalds had a purchasing mechanism for people to buy whatever they want there and receive a receipt to show the cashier and you're basically done, all that's left is waiting for your food. Quick Tip: You are able to pay with cash if you prepurchase, but the money will go to the cashier, not the mechanism. The mechanism does accept any kind of Credit/Debit card.",1
"Amazing place ,thank for your services..",1
Open 24 hours and serves all day breakfast.,1
One of the best coffees in Miami,1
Crystal was the manager the night i was in. she was very attentive she listened to me and right away solved my issue and gave me such a nice dining experience that night thank you so mush crystal and your wonderful staff.,1
"Clean, fast service",1
"Not lovin it. Dear all McDonald's, please shut the business down or sell actual food please. I can't believe the FDA ACTUALLY approves of this plastic food industry. Exhibit A- chicken nuggets. This gunk does not tear like an actual chicken. I rest my case.",1
It is equal here in Brazil. Not new.,1
Gets busy so remember your order number so servce  runs smoothly,1
"Typical McDonald's Fast Food Restaurant if on a budget in South Beach this is ideal, store manager needs to deal with those coming into store and not purchasing food or drink can be intimidating for some people.",1
Best value meal = Double Quarter Pounder Cheese just the sandwich with a Glass of water.,1
"The food is good and their service is great. They only have one cash register in the morning, hate me more than one cash register open in the morning because of the traffic .",1
Good staff and food,1
Trendy and Touristy planted in the right ventricale of South Beach. It has a modern make over. Not at all a bad ace for window shopping.,1
Havent ate mcdonalds in a year.ordered a filet o fish.it was excellent. And the girl behind the register.dont know her name but she was a sweetheart. Dont see that often in mickey dees.,1
I don't eat McDonald's usually bit when I'm in town I come to this location Bex the food is fresh.,1
"Both English and Spanish staff. Very kind. The food is, you know, food from McDonald's, but the service and the restaurant are very good. Bathrooms were clean.",1
"Ordered take out. The staff was great and attentive, the food was perfect. Great location.",1
It's McDonalds come on folks of course I'm still lovin'' it..J.O,1
"Great, the apple fritters are my favorite !",1
Always good,1
Always quick service,1
Everybody there was kind and hard working. Me and my sister went for breakfast and they hustled and made everything perfect in a few minutes:),1
Yo I'm in Miami and they got steak and pancakes. That steak is gooood. I'm from Jersey we don't have that. McDonald's spread the love up North.,1
An ice cream cone is still a great buy here. I couldn't eat the whole thing. Doug had to eat part of it.,1
Very tasty food,1
It was McDonald's exactly like ray crock wanted anyone inted anyone in the world takes the same,1
Good for late night meal TBH,1
Saved my but one night. Manager was very kind and considerate to my situation and let me stay till I figured out what I needed to do,1
"Standard McDs, but fully of the most shady nut jobs ever and this was 10am on a Saturday morning",1
"Loved McDonald's!only time I get to have it is when I adventure over to Lincoln Avenue and head towards south beach
Come on Miami beach build one near publix or Walgreens on 71st street",1
This Mcdonalds is really improving! I can see a lot of improvement specially on the staffs! Keep up the good work!,1
The least expensive meal we have had in South Beach...I enjoyed every bite of it!!!,1
"Lovely for price and location. Fast Food great for ""very hungry"" and little money rs",1
Easy access to SouthBeach. Good customer service.,1
"Good shakes :)
Lot's of cream.",1
Service was good quick and the place was clean.,1
The restaurant was good except it took awhile to place and get my order.,1
"tense enviroment, tourist being lost, locals not knowing English, the youth being punks.. great time!",1
Always super busy and food is out quickly and still hot!,1
Very Good service.Mcd was packed & employees were very very professional & courteous. Repeat customer.,1
Despite having a lot of people waiting they manage to have them satisfied,1
Quick service.,1
"Q: will i ever get tired of the breakfast sandwiches?? A : No. They can do with tidier tables , though",1
Its McDonald's. Nothing to expect other than you've eaten most our lives. Staff was very friendly. Cheapest place to eat in south beach.,1
"I always love Mcdonalds. It never fail me every time I needed to get a quick bite

Always the best!",1
Great example. A bit busy. Had to wait quite a while for the food.,1
They was fast and hot and fresh not much seating tho,1
Gr8,1
I love McDonald's from south beach Washington ave every day mc coffee in my head ,1
Best mc Donald fast and service good food not expensive ,1
Staff was quick and professional. A welcome improvment from my last visit!,1
Very good options for All fast food lovers and placed at nice location....,1
Long waiting time for the order. Staff was nice and ok.,1
"I love the food and all. When I ordered a kids meal, I asked to get Rocket (Guardians of the galaxy), and I was told they didnt know what it was.
Then when I received my kids meal, they gave me a Black Panther... ",1
Just like Jack in the Box they let u dine in off a uber eats order . it makes it so much more helpful,1
"This is the cleanest McDonald's I have ever been in. I normally won't review fast food places, but when I use the restroom at this location it was absolutely sparkling there was also a schedule on the door on the way out that showed when and who cleaned the restroom last I appreciate it that. The food was typical McDonald's good but probably unhealthy. :-)",1
Not bad was happy to have this sometimes you have to have something from home.  Was constantly good in texas and in san diego,1
Got my order right but for 20 nuggets I should have got at least 4 sauces :),1
Excellent experience. Went through the drive-thru and met the kindest employee James. Now let me tell you about James. He was humorous and really made my McDonalds experience one to remember. He made us laugh unexpectedly which was quite a nice surprise. 10/10 would recommend befriending James as he is a wonderful and positive employee.,1
The courtesy and politeness of the staff is excellent ,1
We are visiting from out of state and have eaten here several times. Highly recommend ordering at the kiosk as it takes a while for a cashier to take your order.,1
"One of the better McDonald's locations! Clean; with friendly helpful staff; and even got all my orders all correct. Drive through can be a little slow, but its a smaller location and the staff actually does a good job making the orders!",1
"The drivethru line at this location is, had been, and will always be broken. Dont ask me why, because i do not know. Maybe it is because the 3rd window is rarely used. Idk, but go inside if you have a small order as its faster to go to a register. Check your order when they are super busy as they give you a diet, or another order on occasion. Otherwise my favorite place to get a large coke, for $1$.",1
Love the sausage egg and cheese McGriddle ,1
This McDonald's was and normally is always very fast and my orders always correct. The only thing is the past few times I've been my chicken sandwich was not good at all and the French fries were not fresh but then pumpkin and holiday pies were the best!!! The staff is always nice tho. You can't dine in or done on their patio. You can't use their restrooms either. They do wear face masks and require you to wear one when going inside the establishment. They're 24hours in their drive thru.. not exactly sure about going inside to ?because the last time I went inside to order I was there around 9pm and they were still open for togo orders. Breakfast hours are Monday thru Sunday starting at 4am. Monday t,1
"First off, no wait...
Secondly, Fabiola was super nice.....
Finally......The McRibken!!!!

#doit",1
Fresh fries and nuggets. Better than the one in Pacific beach. Shame no dine in. Only take out. Bathroom is closed to public.,1
"I퐉 a healthcare worker. I went through the drive-through today to get my thank you meal. The person at the first window looked at my ID and said is that really you? I just think that rude for her to say that in her tone of voice is though I had someone else ID.
The second window was another shocker. The manager was working the the food serv",1
"The food was as expected and the building new. However I gave 5 stars for the employee that I saw buy a older homeless women coffee with his own money. He brought the lady the coffee and explained ""you cant just hang out in here, but you can drink ur coffee as long as youd like"". This event made my 9$ dinner priceless",1
I just had a hot fudge sundae and a soda. It was a very hot day and it hit the spot. There was air conditioning inside!,1
"This place is absolutely Epic! I know this probably isn't the first time I've praised wonderful good old-fashioned McDonald's, but they never stop putting smiles on my face! Today I was overly stressed cuz I have too much going on and I forgot to mention that I wanted my cheeseburgers plain of course I remember seconds after they had me my completed order ... without any hesitation they take those two covered in sauce throw them in the trash and make me to fresh ones the way I like it! Wham bam thank you ma'am I'll see you soon!",1
Very efficient drive through staff. Great fries as well. The inside however is very Spartan and not clean. You also have to pay to use the bathroom! See my photo. What the what....,1
This place is awesome it lets us Uber drivers use the restroom and we can take a break inside any time. Got some cheeseburgers earlier today and a large diet Coke everything for under 4 bucks. The manager there just needs to smile a little more!,1
Donald's app is the app that keeps on giving and their mobile ordering is awesome I just barely had any money left for food the other day pull up into one of their new mobile ordering parking spots turn on the location in the phone to see what deals they going to throw at me couple bucks left on my card all of a sudden buy anything on the menu get a free sandwich mobile order only I bought myself a small shake for $2 I got one of those Artisan Chef burgers for 6 bucks my total $2.16 I was able to have a meal with what I had and that burger was delicious I didn't even have to get out of my truck I wasn't feeling so well and they brought it out to that parking spot promptly and it was hot and fresh awesome I'm loving it,1
"Very nice stablishment. Just got remodeled and it also has a big parking lot. It has restrooms accesible with a quarter or a coin obtained from the cashier. They always habe everything that is served on the menu (except ice cream). The service is very good and most of the people in there speak Spanish, so it is a plus for those who don't speak English.",1
"This Micky Ds was the best ive been to since 1985. Seriously. Clean, friendly, no snotty workers. I ACTUALY got napkins IN my bag between my meals. I dont rate Mcdonalds ever because its simply a fast food place but these guys were an old standard brought to 2018. Thx :)",1
5 stars because the girl at drive thru is ridiculously cute ( ;   Hmu @home_grownz,1
Getting better with service!  Nice people.,1
"The staff has to constantly deal with the homeless community that is always loitering around this place. The McDonald's restaurant is clean and the food is up to par, but the environment could be better.",1
"Four stars only because it's open 24 hours (not just the drive thru) and is one of the few late night bathroom options for Lyft and Uber drivers.  Popular with the homeless crowd for the same reason though and it's still a McDonald's, eat at your own risk.",1
Newly remodeled outside of store. Looks great. Fast drive through. Sometimes there are too many homeless hanging around in or outside the parking lot.,1
The burger was nice,1
"It's a McDonald's, quick cheep place to eat.",1
I just have one problem if it 24hr for drive thru only could you please put hours your open in dining so I can get my food too cause I don,1
Allways I had good experiences it is my favorite place to be all the time great people many cultures good food they cook very well and clean,1
"Much better now that they remodeled it. It used to have that feeling of homeless feeder, but not anymore. It",1
Good food good attitudes of the employees only downside is the main lobby floor was very sticky almost to the point of me walking out of my sandles.,1
Inflation is really hitting americans.,1
It was smooth. Fries were fresh. Shake was on point. This location is a good one. Location by my house is trash.  Lol,1
"Great for a late night snack. However, there needs to be more workers at night as it seems there are long wait times for food during the late night hours.",1
Nice clean McDonald's with a friendly staff and great location! Check out the McDonald's app for their free holiday items with $1 purchase!,1
"Like a time capsule. Older respectable adults running the place and food packed in such a way perfect with napkins, it was like 1982 all over again. Thx guys wow. (I just gave 5 stars to Mc-Ds lol smh)",1
"This McDonald's is really great, they are always friendly and helpful, never have had a problem, and people comments on the homeless here but it has never been a problem and they usually stay outside, but homeless is a problem everywhere and they are human just like everyone who's putting them down",1
"Staff were helpful, outdoor seating is closed st this time. No eating on site or restrooms.",1
"The staff has always be friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable about the stores products.  85-90% of the time the service is quick.",1
Not the best McDonalds but it's around the corner from my place.  Drive-thru speaker often has trouble with the order but everything usually comes out alright.,1
"Awesome staff, fast food. Lots of homeless people around but they keep it classy",1
Always is very good option  for a quick bite,1
I'm a nugget fan I really like McDonald's nuggets and fries and and a large strawberry shake om OMG,1
"One of my favorite McDonald's, no complaint so far an they have a good Ice Coffee!!",1
The new quarter pounder burgers are awesome! Really fresh and tasty. ... Try them out!,1
"Food was well-prepared and the place was very clean, but they keep everything on lock down, and you need to ask for refills.",1
The lady at the drivethu WAS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!  I wish she could be cloned for all my future customer service/sales to my consumer endeavors .,1
Great drive thru staff. The girls on night shift are the best,1
Good standard here. I like that I can trust that the burgers and fries are good whenever I show up,1
What can I say? One more nice place for fast lunch!,1
Clean your bathrooms,1
"Great service, efficient, consistent good McDonald's here. Great job",1
Awesome customer service and the only place that carries the strawberry creme pies. Lovely!!!,1
Super busy due to the santa parade but the staff handled it well.  We watched the parade from the patio,1
Quick and clean. If you go inside you can customize your order on their automated order machines!,1
"As far as fast food goes this restaurant is nice, clean, and inviting. The staff is professional and friendly.",1
"Staff is friendly but they almost always get something in the order wrong that has to be corrected, which they will do without issue.",1
"Coffee was excellent and hash brown perfectly crisp.
Great way to start the day ",1
"It's just the best. And the staff put up with the worst kind of people, bless their hearts.",1
Great service which you don't always get from every McDonald's,1

Fresh Food and AWESOME TABLE SERVICE!!! 5 STARS 占쏙,1
"Stopped by from Canada trip with my family, ordered Big Macs and quarter pounder. Both burgers were super fresh. Will definitely  stop by, the lady on the counter even brought us the food since we didn h",1
"Being that it's the first Mickey D's after you cross into the US from Qubec, Canada, this place gets seriously packed at times with the Canadian tourists. I saw 2 buses stopping in to feed their passengers during my short visit here, on top of the regular customers and/or those that are traveling by cars. Just like those working at Mickey D's over the border in the Canadian side (mainly showing French), these workers only spoke English and weren't too thrilled about French-only customers. I used the app to place my order, which was more convenient and the workers seemed to appreciate that more, since they don't have to deal with extra people face-to-face. My order came out in timely manner (even with tons of tourists flooding in) and the food was good. Staff was friendly as they get. Huge parki",1
Stopped in for a quick visit at this newly built location. Nice bright dining room with fresh flowers on the tables. The usual self ordering screens or a helpful staff behind the counter waiting to take your order. If you are in need of food on the go this location has you covered. Two drive through lanes and mobile order curbside spots so as to get you back on the road faster. As McDonalds go this is a great improvement.,1
Great stop after coming over the border! Truck parking and green grass for the dogs!! Always clean inside and order is always correct!,1
"Nice place to stop when crossing over to the US. The service is pretty fast thnaks to the help of automated service screens. The restaurant is clean. You can also access two drive-through lanes. There is a huge parking, so there is always place to park. The restaurant offers free wi-fi, which is very convenient.",1
Fresh and good! Plus very clean and modern. Probably the nicest McDonald's I've been to in a while.,1
One of the cleanest and most modern McDonald's location's I've been to. The staff were really nice and my food was ready before my butt had a chance to hit the seat.,1
Very clean and has a kiosk that you can order. Drive through is available as well.,1
"Shout out to the Champlain, NY staff who handled a very stressful situation last night very well. They had long lines at the window and a sudden large crew from a bus with tight time needs and some hangry energy. The staff was gracious throughout and incredibly fast. Thank you!",1
Typical McDonald's fast service,1
"Friendly stop right after the can-us border, great service",1
As good as most McDonald,1
"Best McDonald's I've ever visited. Clean, with flowers on the table and table service. As good as it gets for a fast food restaurant. Bravo.",1
I never give McDonalds a 5 Star but this newly build restaurant has table service and the food is hot and terrific. There was a older store here previously but this new one is da bomb.,1
Really nice place and experience! Higly recommend it! Even for a date!,1
The service was great surprisingly! Our food was hot and they actually had our order completely correct! Which is a big plus for this McDonald's. I do recommend McDonald's if you go at the right times,1
Got the job done and place was very clean.,1
"I have to say how impressed I am with this McDonald's. It is one of the very few fast food restaurants I've been to that always put a smile on your face. The staff is super courteous. The food is always good. The fries are always hot. Whenever I cross the border, I try to stop here just because I know the service is impeccable. They deserve an award for being so friendly.",1
My visit went well. The employees were busy working yet friendly and attentive. I used the McD app for the first time here also. Always glad to get a good deal and great service. Good job.,1
"Service is slow, even even when the place is empty. I wouldn't dare go when the place is actually busy. It's a bit expected since it's so close to the border.
The interior seems pretty clean and the customer service is decent. I've only been on days when it's not busy, so my experiences have been decent.",1
I usually go there every morning but my order usually gets messed up at least once a week. with that being said they do replace my meal for free on the following visit.,1
"Stuff is super polite and nice and helpful. 4 stars because if you pay at a kiosk, grab a receipt and a table number, find a place, proudly install the number on top of it and wait you are sort of in a limbo: your order is not shown on any display, you have no clue when and how you will be served.
We waited for a good 20 min and then I just asked a very nice and polite servant if I did everything correctly and when we will be served. He said all is ok and they just have too many orders at this time but he said I will help.
Suggestion to the higher management.
All orders numbers have to be on one of the displays otherwise there are no feedback to the paid clients and with a less passionate clients you may have issues.
What is for sure is that this situation decreases efficiency of the floor workers since the current state of kiosk order processing creates a situation in which ppl will be asking questions that can easily be fixed by software upgrade!!
McCheers!!!

"Hello

I was stunned to read reviews of this location on Google.  Not our experience at all.

My wife and I both agree that this was the finest, cleanest, friendliest McDonalds we have ever been to ... dating back to the mid 1970's!  That's a lot of McDonalds all across Ontario, Quebec and probably 30 states in the USA.

We stopped on our way through for a quick bite at about 11:30 a.m. Thursday May 9 and again at about 1:30 p.m. Monday May 13.

We loved the staff, the patriotic decorations and just the overall welcoming atmosphere.

What a place.  Hope they keep it up!",1
"Last stop before entering Canada! I recommend grabbing a bite here because one thing awaits you for sure for 1+hrs at the other side of the border: traffic. Grab a bite and if you're coming back from Canada, I think they accepted all of my Canadian change that I had left so that was convenient too.",1
"I only went in to use the bathroom and get a refreshment, but they were promoting ""Lobster Rolls!"" So I ordered one. One of the best Lobster Rolls I ever had! It was very tasty, and had plenty of lobster meat. Besides all of the lobster meat, my sandwich had the the full piece of meat from a claw!",1
"Easy and clean  place to stop once you come back into the US  from the Canadian border.  The coffee is good and restroom is clean. Decour is a bit dated, but the food comes out fast and taste  the way it should.",1
"Coming from Quebec and it's 1pm, we stopped by for quick lunch. Burger was of course very good and the place is very modern but what surprised me was the great service. There was this McDonalds employee who was asking us if we need anything like soda refills or coffee. This is the first McDonalds that I experienced this great service. Go there folks!",1
"This particular location is a regular stop for us after crossing the border.

Usually clean, good gas stations in area.

Also, good spot to access your Canadian data plan one last time.",1
Good and fast service with their new drive through. always in and out very quickly. Glad to have this in the area.,1
One of the best mcdonalds I have been too. We travel from Montreal to New York frequently and often stop by this mcdonalds. The service is always efficient and quick. Premises always clean! Definitely a thumbs up especially considering how filthy and awful some other mcdonalds can be!!,1
Great food and great service,1
Always loved McDonald's.,1
"On point service. Got straws, napkins, even a salsa for my breakfast burrito! Quick service too!",1
"The foods always good here but the waiting time sucked. Its like nobody in there wanted to work this night. Almost 10 minutes waiting for simple orders, and it was at the end and it wasn't packed. Smh",1
"Who rates McDonalds?! Well, this one is worth rating. Fresh flowers at the tables, a greeter, super clean, table delivery, friendly staff, classy interior (yes, better than other mcds...). Nice job at this location! Impressed!",1
"Drive-thru can be very slow. Your better off to go in, order on the kiosk, then leave with your food if you don't want to dine in. The food is comparable to other McDonald's franchises I've been to.",1
Same as every other McDonald's,1
It's one of the most techi mcdonalds out there.  However it does occasionally take more than a few minutes to get your food in the drive through on a busy day.  You're better off to go in an order from the kiosk and sit at the tables.  They all have flowers on them.,1
It was backed up after baseball and bcuz a bunch of electrical workers came in off of 87. But after just a few minutes wait the drive thru started working very rapidly.,1
"A good McDonalds location. Placed an in app order for drive thru pick up. All went well, quickly and correctly fulfilled. Staff was friendly. Thumbs up!",1
Good service short waiting time friendly people here,1
It was okay they never rly get my order correct tho,1
"We Canadians get so much less than USA McD's.  I don't even bother going to Canadian outlets unless it was for the $1.00 coffee. Here, everything was done as McD would want...AND served to your table another difference between the two.",1
This place doesn't serve McLobster roll anymore.  We used to go there twice a summer for their lobster roll.  I gave a 4 stars became of the interior quality.,1
Prices were most impressive.,1
Had to come for the mcrib. Last chance it was delicious!,1
This location always has friendly staff.,1
Fast service very clean great stop at the border,1
"This McDonald puts Quebec locations to shame.
",1
Thier new drive thru is much faster than the old one,1
It's no longer a cheap meal ours usually for two people cost around 20 bucks but the coffee is good and we know that the food is always to a certain standard which is very important when we're traveling on the highway and we don't know the restaurants.,1

Fast friendly and accurate.foid was freshly prepared.Great job,1
"The McDonald's next to the boarder was awesome! The food was nice, and the place itself if decked you with great machines!",1

"One of the best McDonalds, much better compared to almost any Macdonald in Montreal. The staff never forgets anything and ensures that the orders are in order at all times. A good McDo to stop on the way back to the United States ",1
There is always good music in the bathrooms 占쏙,1

"Cheap, with free wifi",1
Really way too busy.,1
"Tasty
Food but far too few staff so slow treatment",1
"Great place first place where you can make a toilet stop. For me, it's a tradition to eat McDonald's after customs and before returning to Canada. I find the lunch excellent because of the biskits. The place is clean and the staff excellent",1
Close to the canada border. US and CANADA border. rest area,1
"Quick and cheerful service. The food was fine. However, the coffee tasted burnt and the canned apple juice really wasn't the best.",1
Fast service. Clean restaurant.,1
"No beer, sorry. Looking forward to seeing you, a good place to grab a bite to eat after crossing the border from Canada",1
Fast service yesterday morning 7 hrs and the perfect and tasty bacon eggmcmuffin! Impressive 占쏙,1
Renovated. Decorated with ambiance. Table service! A McDo with class.,1

"Just passing thru and needed to use the restroom. Quickly realized I was not in the best part of town but could hold it no longer. A short line to order my small drink and fry, restroom is for customers, and get the code for the door. To my surprise, the restroom was stocked and clean. When I exited, I looked around and noticed how clean the rest of the area was. Maybe because so few of us dine in nowadays.  I know how hard cleanliness can be to achieve and maintain in this industry, so 5 stars to them. Best $5 pit stop ever, and I can not say the same for the coffee shop chain I frequent.",1
5 stars for excellent customer service. Ana and Alvaro were amazing and extremely patient with our order process.,1
At this location the service is good and the restaurant is clean,1
good place to eat and good quality food.,1
Big Mac and fries plus a drink for 6 dollars Really good thank you McDonald's app,1
The Egg sausage McMuffin is better and larger than in San Bernardino,1
Honestly best customer service from Naisha thank you,1
"Went through Drive Thru, in and out fast, back to my office in no time.",1
Eli the manager went above and beyond for Breakfast he deserves a raise for his willingness to give the customer patience and fresh food,1
"Very friendly crew, coffee is great,so is their big Mac.",1
Was okay... Place is clean and the staff were nice. There was a crazy man in there making the place uncomfortable to be in. I think he threatened one of the staff members. I just got my two McChickens and then left before the cops came.,1
Well I love filet of fish and since I haven't seen my dog in a day and a half I spoil him I got him a couple of hamburger patties can't go wrong with that the fillets were delicious Hot buns toasted caramelized perfectly tartar sauce right on the center and the cheese was lined up correctly with the filet pattie. And if you've never tried McDonald's green salsa packets give it a try they are delicious,1
I feel like the food is okay but like if I had to go there every single day I would look he get tired of it and I just wouldn't like it oh that's my review on it but oh and also the people that do not listen,1
I only get the same thing for McDonald's fresh fries and McDoubles are triple cheeseburger,1
Busy and fast paced restaurant. They do have play area for children.,1
"It was an ok exp.i got to meet new people,and enjoy the company im with
As I Waite on my special other half
MY SISTER!",1
Good staff weren't demanding or rude will come be coming back to this restaurant,1
This is a nice location to go and grab a quick meal or snack. The lines are not usually that long and the restaurant itself is usually very clean and comfortable. We often go there. I definitely recommend this location to anyone who likes McDonald's. The prices of course are also very reasonable and the turnaround time is usually very fast. Two thumbs up.,1
Great place to eat..,1
Very good,1
"Slow service because there is few people working there at 8 in the morning. Janitor was nice to let us into the restrooms that require a keycode. It was mostly empty in the dining area, the line and the parking lot. There was however a very long drive-thru line.",1
The shift leader was a sweet heart  she delivered my food right on my tablet .. which I know they don't give that type of service but I really did appreciate it. . good job honey.  Keep up the great work,1
Great experience when I asked for more condiments twice other times some people get a bothered face x9 breath in breath out is my advice on that x),1
"Daughter wanted the Travis Scott burger. She says it's a hit or miss with her friends. I ordered the newly freeze drink which gave me an adult ""brain freeze"" and it wasn't as sweet like the Icee back in the day. I wouldn't order it again.",1
"Long drive through, but always worth that unique McDonald's taste.  The Filet O Fish with the humongous glob of tartar sauce that slides out (NO matter how hard you try) all over your shirt while you're driving.  One of my favorites.   As a favorite,  I feel I shouldn't have to--wait for for it....",1
Wait time is too long and ordered french fries n it was cold,1
Great service when you specify your order clearly to the employees.,1
I had excellent customer service and got my mc griddle hot and tasty.  Great food and people,1
"Don't really appreciate this part of town... But, when I crave McDonald's. I drive 21 miles one way, because they serve the best big Macs I've had. It truly is delicious.",1
This location is much better since they got dual drive thru lanes; it's much faster and efficient now. Sidenote: they never have salads!,1
"Although the two drive thru lines were pretty long when I got there,  the service was very fast and accurate.",1
"A nice new remodel , could use more staff ,a little slow",1
"This is the only McDonald's that is close to my house, but honestly I don't really like it... For some reason they are always slow. The drive-thru is always packed.",1
Their food was good and they had something for my birthday,1
"We were out and about and we stopped to pick up some refreshments. The service was excellent, and the place was clean and well-kept... I would highly recommend it.",1
Clean and modern inside.,1
They have great service and are fast at handing out fresh and hot food. They are also really good at solving issues to assure customers get the best service.,1
"It was very clean inside. The service was friendly, fast and helpful. The food was fresh and tasted good. My order was correct when I received it.",1
"Latoya was so awesome, she was patient to walk me through how to use the app",1
Service was fast and good. The line was long at drive-thru but not much u can do about it,1
You can't go wrong right. Cheap good food. Those fried. Chocolate Sunday. Big Mac. Double Quarter Pounder. In a rush. Use the mobile pickup. Order ahead of time and go to drop off.,1
I love McDonald's this place is so professional and you always get top grade food,1
Is a good place gor Take a moment to relax,1
It quick fast and easy didn't have no issues with the food I ordered,1
"It's clean but a transit hub for the ""transit people"" . I took the bus there myself hahaha, but I'd like to imagine I'm not ugly.",1
"Drive-thru line looked long, but moved really quickly, my order was even ready at the first window!",1
It was cool but the bathroom was nasty!!,1
"Bad service sweet tea was not sweet, food was cold, but except for French fries they were popin hot and just they right amount of salt",1
GET THE APP AND SAVE COOL OFF BY GETTING ICE CREAM CONE OR ICE COFFEE,1

The service is great especially if you pre-order via the app. The place is kept clean,1
Came in early in the morning service Wells fast and courteous food was fine it was hot and everything is cooked perfect,1
Good place to eat and chill! Has Wi-Fi,1
Hot cakes and sausage plate,1
Adequate seating when I ate there pre-covid...haven't been there since 2018!,1
McDonald's is so much better this days you can place your order and pay for it without waiting in line....,1
As good as McDonald's can be but at 1:30 in the afternoon it took way too long to get through the drive through line.,1
Easy to get in and out.,1
I been to this McDonald's twice the first time they wer kinda slow but I like the nice peaceful clean environment looks freshly remodeled,1
They originally messed up my order but I came back and let them know it was unacceptable and they gladly replace my order and gave me a free oreo Shake,1
took a little long in the drive thru but i understand we going thru a epidemic,1
"#1 large size with a Coke, 6 piece nuggets with 2 sweet/sour and 1 hot mustard! ",1

"Wonderful experience, great customer service.",1
VERY CONVENIENTLY PLACE SPECIALLY IN THIS STRESSFUL TIME. THANKS ,1
Fast and friendly. Usual McDonald's quality,1
"There's nothing like eating a spicy Mc chicken at the legendary pier.
The prices are good (as always). I highly recommend the dollar menu, in this case, 2 Mc chickens for only $4. The taste is very good! For the price of course. And the spicy one tastes even better. Service was very fast, but it can get very packed in the afternoon. Plenty of seats and restrooms are available as well (it gets packed, too). Pickup available. The everyday McDonald's, but placed in a crowded and convenient spot. We highly recommend spicy Mc chicken with extra buffalo sauce!",1
"I don't eat at McDonald's, but I do UberEats deliveries. I love this McDonald's because it has a parking structure in an area that typically doesn't have one. This makes it very convenient for me and people who choose to eat there.",1
The Santa Monica location is on par with most McDonald's out there. The food was satisfactory and the speed of service was reasonable. My only problems with the experience were the restaurant was incredibly busy and the smell of pot was pretty strong from someone smoking it out on the patio. They had the munchies I guess.,1
It McDonald ,1
Look the staff here is great despite the unwanted obvious nuisance. Food is prepped fast and staff are professional. Restroom are actually kept clean again despite certain unfortunate citizens. I always take out from here and go to the beach. Or park my car at the very top of the lot and eat there.,1
"It's McDonald's...by the pier.  McDonald's. In the wee hours (only time I go) it can be colorful with the occasional altercation/conflict, but they have security.  Never had a issue there.  Order my food from the kiosk, wait, p/u, eat while I walk home and later wish that I didn't order 3 to 4 sandwiches.",1
Good place. Can get crowded sometimes but the service is quick. I had a huge order and was served in under 10 minutes. I love McDonald's quality so much. This particular location is also right down the street from Santa Monica Pier. A great place to eat before going to the beach!,1
"Everytime I go into the Santa Monica McDonald's, it able to handle the busy times. In my opinion consider the customer traffic, however they waist no time getting orders, if you do not have a cloud following, then you should get what you want. Bathrooms have intermittent traffic depending on the busy time. I see they want you to enjoy your meal, in my opinion. In the pictures you will available seating at a perfect time. I was satisfied!",1
"It's a McD's, fast food cause you don't have a lot of time when you're going somewhere. Convenient place to grad a quick breakfast in the morning with all other shops still closed",1
"It has been a mighty long time since I need ed to concern myself with dining in at McDonald's.
Since Covid19, the option to dine in was removed. Remarkable.",1
Your service was excellent the employee Erica needs a raise because when I got there the lines were long and she cleared them out real fast thank you Erica,1
"Nice place, even with the homeless around it clean and comfortable place. The food preparation process is fast and the staff are nice. I had tried the first tim",1
It's not clean and there are no offers but still ok. Bathroom is usually clean,1
Lots of homeless people inside,1
"No drive thru, enough parking. Crowded but fairly quick. They had the front doors open and I could feel the air moving, not stuffy. Mask optional at the time (July/28/22). All employees were wearing masks. All employees were pleasant or acceptably neutral and doing a good job. Bathrooms and tables clean.  Floors looked pretty good too considering the large amount of foot traffic. Indoor and outdoor tables. Whenever someone got up, a worker appeared shortly after to spray and wipe down the table. In person you can order at  cashiers or use one of the 8 self-service screens. I believe you could also order through the app. There's a scanner at the bottom of the payment pinpad.
Didn't have to wait very long for my food. Less than 5 minutes.",1
Located on State Street in Hurricane Utah! It connected to 711 Gas Station so this makes traveling easy for food and gas stop! Has,1
"Hungry? Won't spend much money? Go to Mc. Donals! Come hungry, leave happy!",1
"clean tidy mc donalds. helpful staff. lots of seats both indoors and outdoors. love they didnt have the stupid oversized ipad ordering system which they have in the UK.
its a short walk from or to the beach near santa monica pier. and a short walk from the train station blueline and not far from the local shops.
please like this review if you find it helpful
thank you",1
Great place to eat awesome staff friendly and helpful enjoy your meal as you'll be loving it.,1
"To be honest, I usually frequent this local Santa Monica Micky D's for its coffee. I have to wake up pretty early, so a nice jolt of caffeine helps me start the day at 5am. With that being said, I will also say that because of Santa Monica's influx of homelessness over the years, this particular location gets alot of homeless patrons. Most are nice, and I buy some of the regulars a thing or two from time to time; however, it's the aggressive homeless patrons that make the place feel troublesome. The staff tries to placate situations, but you can tell they are getting frustrated more and more everyday. So, if you can't handle, talk, be patient, and react positively to people who are just trying to get through the day, the don't go here. I don't need you screaming and being annoyed at every little thing. Bye!!",1
"This McDonalds is conveniently close to Santa Monica Pier (about 1 block away). I love buying food from here and eating it by the shoreline with friends :,). Do note, that workers can sometimes be very stingy or serious due to the large amount of people that come in daily (this McDonalds in particular gets very packed). So please be kind to them, they are trying their best to get your food served! <3",1
One of the Best McDonald's so far. Good service,1
"Good location, very big place",1
"Doing their best for no man and the food is still the same level of addicting.  No drive-thru and right next to the beach.  It is usually teeming with people and it is usually a little busy.  Kiosks available.  On this trip, the payment option for me was unavailable on the kiosk.",1
Loved our family afternoon there,1
Basically what you want from McDonalds without all the bums and beggars in the store during the day,1
"It's a Nice McDonald's due to location you can grab a small amount of food and go to the pier, also people talk about beggers being near it but I didn't see any all I saw was a man overdosing on drugs",1
Friendly staff and fast service,1
"High traffic fast food restaurant that doesnt fail on being exactly just that. In the process ,  however ,  it also us one of the few places in the area that offers a no frills area to eat your food AL FRESCO. And in this day in age ,  thats priceless.",1
So busy. Staff are literal heroes.,1
"The only reason I am giving this location for stars instead of 5 is because overall, I don't eat McDonald's or fast food. However, the one day that I did go to Santa Monica, I just had a sudden craving for something fatty and sugary.

I went inside and dislocation surprisingly very clean. The staff there were also very hospitable, friendly, and alert. I ordered me some french fries and a sweet iced tea, and then I proceeded to the outdoor Courtyard to eat.

Out there was just as clean as it was on the inside. I haven't had McDonald's since 2012, so I was really surprised at how fresh the french fries and the sweet iced tea taste it.

Everything was okay okay with me.",1
"If we focus too much on ourselves and the troubles in our lives, it is very difficult to be happy. Lord, refresh my spirit, help me let go of longing to become something I am not and show me how to be the best of who I am.
Open your mind and empty your heart of fears so that you can know and experience God to the fullest. Lord, You are my peace, my assurance and the love that I hold on to.Reach higher than you think possible for all that you want and you find that often you attain even more. Lord, I rely on Your promises made to each of us and especially on Your love.
Be patient with others, but mostly be patient with yourself. Lord, help me to keep a smile on my face and to realize my goodness and refuse to dwell on my imperfections.Desiring more and more without appreciating what you have right now will never allow you to be truly happy. Be grateful for the gifts you are receiving right this very minute. That's happiness!God gives abundantly to those who pass His gifts on to others. Lord, let Your blessings flow in to me and then out from me. I will neither be selfish nor let my gifts stagnate.
Use Jesus' as your example on how to live. Lord, You will guide and advise us and then You will leave it to us to decide our own future. Give us wisdom in our choices.Dear Lord, thank you for being such a loving God and caring about our pain. You don't want to see us suffer. You know the suffering that we face, and I ask that you would please redeem it and bring it to an end. In the midst, Lord, I believe that you are sufficient. I ask that your strength will be made perfect in our weakness. In Jesus's name, amen",1
Always has an abundance of homeless population hanging out inside and outside. (Remove that you get 5 stars) Felt dirty although they were constantly cleaning the restaurant. Food is your typical McDonald's no change there. They offer a bathroom but its a busy location. Overall I'd return with caution ,1
There was a psycho there but the guard tazed her,1
"There have been issues with some of the patrons getting out of hand with the staff, but it seems that the issue has improved. My family generally order through food delivery apps from this location to avoid unruly patrons. They always get our order right, and the delivery is seamless.",1
"Very nice, very clean.
Saw a guy come in who ""looked"" homeless and 2 security guards immediately swarmed in and ushered him out. It was kind of impressive, yet I felt so sorry for the guy and thought security should have been more sensitive when doing the job because the man clearly wasn't all there.

Also, the men's rest room was very clean, however I'd prefer paper towels on hand in addition the the blowers. I had to touch the press down facet button and I had to touch the soup dispenser. I like to use paper towels to touch these things... especially the door when leaving...",1
Santa Monica pier is a few steps from here.,1
Wonderful beachside McDonald's on Santa Monica Beach... food is excellent and the restroom is open to the public until 11 p.m.,1
Fine it's always busy place,1
Good McD centrally located and quick service.,1
We usually go mainly for the soft serve covers and sundaes.  Nothing hits the spot on a hot day like a small sundae.  Prices are perfect and the kids really appreciate the treat.  Hot fudge on the bottom really makes it fun for them.,1
"Convenient location and although there are some challenges the area faces (homeless and everything that goes with that), the restaurant does a good job keeping things clean, service helpful, and food good as always. We had an order with a lot of custom requests for kids (no this, extra that), and each burger was put together exactly as ordered.",1
"No different than any other McDonalds, except that it's in Santa Monica very close to the pier and beach. It's surprisingly well kept and clean and very fast. Lots of tourists and visitors and the location is updated with the order kiosk systems so can get moving pretty fast. Seating can be an issue on very crowded days. Over all good experience and not too bad.",1
One of the nicest mc donalds,1
"They always have a lot of staff in hand, specially on the week ends and at peak hours. You will always see a lot of tourist due to the perfect location near the shopping and the pier. This also means that there will be homeless there as well. I like to live and let live so I don't mind sharing space with my fellow man. With that said there is security at hand at all times. Even when this place looks crowded the service is fast and like most McDonald's with a smile. You get something to eat at a great price in a perfect location.",1
They got the best breakfast here.,1
"They accidentally gave my friends and I a whole order that we cancelled, and they also gave us the actual orders we bought. All in all they were pretty fast workers. They have to be because that place is always packed because of the Santa Monica Pier. I understand that it's not always going to be clean there because, frankly, there's not much room to clean there most of the time. If I could give 4.2 stars, I would.",1
"We ate breakfast here every morning while staying at a hotel around the corner. The food was always made correct and fresh, however the large amount of homeless people hanging out make things a little more difficult.  (No condiments are self serve,  the security guard has to let you into the bathroom, sometimes hard to find a table)",1
"I just had a large fry it was okay the kids had hamburger happy meals, the burgers were cold and ""tasted funny"", they ate the fries, and of course really liked the toy inside. 7 out of 10 today mediocre.",1
It was crowded! Unfortunately they don't do refills here.,1
The service is fast but since the pandemic it seems that the mask is the most important thing.. security is polite and the Cusomer service associates are kinda formal but still polite...you can eat on the patio but not for long...,1
"It's McDonald's, cheap sustenance to keep on going. We had a couple burgers and fries and I can't complain they were alright when the price is taken into account. It can be quite busy at times so keep this in mind when going at peak times. The restaurant itself was pretty clean, what you come to expect from a McDonald's.",1
"The service the is great! They do a awesome job with the food, and it has security there so you don't have to worry to lose your chicken nuggets,  and hamburger,  also your money!",1
Great place to eat by the beach without the ridiculous prices . Beware that many homeless people ask you for change but never wanna change the sense of direction his life is unnerving to give people money as they bother while consuming meat patties between buns of bread with seeds. Moral of this review is to never help homeless while eating,1
"Gets very very busy , but they are normally fairly rapid about getting everyone through. By far the cheapest food place in that area, so ideal if you're just visiting. It's still McDonalds though so don't expect anything different from every other franchise.",1
We only eat halal food. The fillet o fish is a good choice for us but the price is high. Though it,1
Only place that is open late night in Santa Monica after 11 pm. Service great and you know the product. Very safe and family friendly. Great location,1
This place is a major tourist hub as it is located within a few blocks from the Santa Monica Pier. Inside is nice. They will also bring food to you that you won't see in any other store or this may be new to me since I have been to Mcdonald's only a few times in my entire life.,1
It's a McDonald's it didn't disappoint. I got another one supersize. And that's what I wanted. Fade Out on the floor back back back to get a bag over there balcony. Exactly what I wanted no surprises.,1
12 midnight this place is packed and they bring it to your table!,1
"Hot and fresh! I always get the Quarter Pounder with cheese,  mac sauce,  pickles and shredded lettuce only!! It's the best!! You gotta try it.

"First thing that caught my eye was its employees, within the times I've stopped by this branch of the Goldin Ark. Reason being is do to it's great customer service. I understand most McDonald's now have self service available to its customers but the times that I've gone to the beach in Santa Monica it's always been alot easier to be attended by their kind employees.",1
Right in front of the WORLD FAMOUS Santa Monica Beach Pier!,1
"They were friendly but they never gave me a tray because they never asked ""for here or to go"". The service was fast, I had my food ready before I could fill up my drink.",1
One of the oldest piers in the country and one of the Top places to visit while in #LALALand,1
"It was nice compared to how it was before, quick if you use the machines to order your food. You can pay credit or cash at the counter or the machine.. order was quick food was dope no issue.",1
The restaurant was clean and orderly. Food was prepared fast and made properly. Everything was decent.,1
Fresh Air an clean facility,1
"Eco-friendly flatware, restroom is locked up tight (transients). Employees are dismissive and arrogant. Not courteous and refuses to answer questions about food products, ie: what's on a cheeseburger answer would be... ""Cheese & bread""! But the food is hot and fast.",1
The food was fast and good for McDonald's. The inside seating area was kinda small and there were a lot of homeless people hanging out in front of the building. The entrance smelled like urine.,1
"They literally almost got the entire order wrong, would not come back ever. My family got two deluxe s round egg, 1small decaf coffee, 2 med coffees with sugar and cream. We ended up with packets of ketchup, no bread for the muffins in the deluxes,no hashbrowns and the wrong amount of cream.

Ok sorry I actually came back the other day and the food was amazing this time. Also, there is another McDonald's in my area that's pretty lame. This place has a better service overall.(sort of long review sorry)",1
"I got my food at around 10 PM on a Thursday night. The McDonalds was packed with people, yet I only had to wait a few minutes to get my food. The staff was friendly and my food was made really well.",1
"The recently advertised 100% real meat patties for their Quarter Pounder burger, more or less, was what you expect--same great taste, same great value, though it did not fail it however didn't feel any different from their other burger options on their selected menu.  Would I get it again?  Yeah, why not?  Makes for a mouth watering meal on the go, quick to be served and ready in minutes with that first warm juicy bite followed by a second, third and maybe fourth?  Who knows, really?  Just Get It and Try One Out Today or When the Munchies hit Mount Everest peaks!",1
First the restroom was clean and it wasn't guarded with a keypad... When I see that I'll go elsewhere. I never use a restroom without purchase and I never ask . Even the chicken sandwich was fresh... Thanks for the service,1
Its mc donalds what can i say,1
"I ate there during a week while I stayed at Santa Monica, the service was really fast, even when the place was crowded.

The computer ordering system is really effective, they have 8 modules and they help a lot for taking orders faster.",1
"The interior of store has recently been upgraded and has made it a lot more pleasant to be in. Due to its proximity to the Pier, there are still plenty of weirdos and homeless people hanging out in and around the store...",1
It's fairly crowded but got my iced macchiato and apple pie. The staff were friendly and attentive for the short interaction.,1
"Lines can be long, but service is friendly. Sometimes it takes longer for the food to come out, but the employees compensate by doing extra for the wait. The employees do practice good customer service.",1
"It's an interesting location for a McDonald's, and this property must be super expensive. Aside from that, it's a good enough place, and I give it 4 stars based on the expectations that come from a McDonald's to begin with. If you're on the Pier and you want a big Mac or some mcnuggets, this is your spot.",1
They get you in and out fast. I love this McDonald's adjacent to the beach  and the Metro Expo Line,1
Blessya all let's all get along. McDonald is giving back .Teenager do have a place to stay it hard on them. Let's live and love. Homeless is trying doing it staying clean Amen. Grace..keep it moving.smile. Sister Ms Rose. PEACE,1
Joshua is cool and helpful. Went above and beyond. Good vibes and energy. Happy guy and honest about the products. Dude was cleaning the whole time and helping customer at same time.,1
"The order was done really quickly, and that was greatly appreciated because we were in a hurry. We bought 20 McNuggets and they tasted amazing! Every one!",1
"The terror of the men was palpable in the air. The stench of blood and bodily waste clung heavy. It had been three days and four nights of terror. Ever since the men had come to this island,  it seemed like everything had gone wrong. Not just like God had abandoned them, but had an active hand against them. The coke here is always watered down.",1
Great customer service for such a busy location. Eating area is kept clean throughout despite obvious challenges of a beach location,1
"The food was good.  I mean,  they put several pickles in my yummy burger.  The fries were perfect.  The wait was a little long.",1
Always long lines .. use the app makes ordering much faster,1
"I love the CA McDonalds have McChickens (we only have Hot N' Spicy in AZ). The service was fast, and the food was fresh and cheap. It was also accurate (no missing items). This is how fast food should always be.",1
"Good as every other mcdonalds but only one big difference.. A lot like a looot of homeless people here, I like it because of the staff but too many homeless, that and this time the resroom run out of seat covers lol",1
"Ruthlessly expensive McDonalds food because it's by the beach, but they take the mobile order deals. Security on site though not too pushy. People seemed friendly enough.",1
"Experienced placing my order by computer touch screen, paying right there and shortly thereafter hearing my number called.  Nice, clean, super busy place.",1
Always very quick and helpful,1
"Nice place to dine in (outside obviously) and take out is fast. Just wish it had a driver thru, overall fast service.",1
Great place for inexpensive food right at Santa Monica Pier. There is also a public parking just below this place. But just inquire about the price first. We were charged $30 for parking and there were cheaper options available nearby.,1
The cheapest place to eat at when your by the pier literally. If your on a budget Mikey Ds serves you at its finest. The problem is they dont have the dollar menu anymore and this place can get packed during lunch hours.,1
"Haven't been here in a while, they have remodeled. They have self order and cashier order. It's close to the peir so expect your occasional homeless ppl but there is a security guard.",1
I go to every McDonalds I can. This one is quick service and good food. But please note that it gets a little crazy at night time. This is a very busy spot next to the pier.,1
Always a nice and friendly place to go. Fast and with good prices as always. It will be there when you need a food.,1
Always for my husbands coffe we stip buy. Value for money for a senior coffee.,1
"Was a McDonald's. You know what you get. The store itself was clean, the service was prompt and the people were nice. The automated ordering machines were a pain to use though and we gave up as it was unresponsive",1
"Kind of  confusing as people were just standing everywhere and one of the workers looked lost herself. Once it cleared out some t hmm ings settled, the food was accurate and warm :)",1
Wonderful customer service,1
"This is my go to McDonald's, now with automated cashiers ordering is quick and easy, nice and clean, courteous employees, it's just getting better!",1
Big Mac,1
Everything was everything as usual.  Keep up the good work.  Thanks to  McDonald's for a happy meal ,1
"No bad location easy to find, service is kinda slow at times though.",1
The food was great. Service was quick. They forgot napkins and ketchup for my to go order.,1
My cashier Anaya was so professional and had the best smile. I was greeted kindly and the place was clean. I will be back,1
Just left the Santa Monica Pier.  Couldn't find an ice cream cone single scoop for less than $6. Thank you McDonald's for having a scoop of Creamy vanilla ice cream for $1.42,1
"It's McDonald's, fast and cheap and admitted one of my guilty pleasures. Sometime I just want a cheap hamburger even if I could grill up a gourmet at home.",1
It was too busy! There going put the door I suggest going to the one of the many local eateries they are all much better than here,1
My favorite McDonald's in all the world is this one. I get to eat outside or just hang outside and watch the beach goers and tourist while listening to there good choice in music over the intercom 24/7.,1
"What you expect from McDonald's - cheap unhealthy fare. Went here to grab a late night bite. Got my order for a mango banana smoothie wrong, but replaced promptly.",1
"The place was busy, but the food came out fast and was acceptable for a McDonald's. Overall not too bad.",1
I like the way you order your food. Its all automated which is great. The food came out quickly.,1
Chicken Nuggets and French Fries were real good. Big plus is the Mexican Style Salsa - very tasty with a bit hot,1
Nice area would go again :),1
"Great service, food perfectly prepared, employee very helpful with my ordering from my McD's app, with which I was having difficulty.",1
Great food great costumer service very very fast with order turn around less than 3 minutes way less bums there,1
Love it.,1
"I like McDonald's, I like ice cream, coffee, humberger, fresh fruit.",1
Fast but too bad they don't give refills and love thst they give eco friendly straws ,1
It's the only fast food place to grab a late night/early morning bite to eat in Santa Monica where you can still dine in. It's also a short walking distance from the Santa Monica Pier.,1
Very clean good place to eat with the family with the economic prices,1
"Certainly nothing fancy but, cheap, and reliable quality. As far as the golden arches goes. This location was better than most.",1
"Very calming great atmosphere, friendly staff",1
Order went smooth and food was fantastic and fresh. Yay,1
The place is usually crowded but the new kiosk help a lot. The place has been cleaned up and it proved quite a bit since last year.,1

Fast dependable service.  Excellent outdoor pavilion.,1
I love this place I like  to see the people who  enjoy their time.,1

"Actually a really good McDonald's , the food seemed higher quality than normal and I actually bought more afterwards because it was better than expected.",1
Doing a good job for the amount of business that comes in daily.... but try to be patient.... mistakes happening often,1

Drinks are nice and within budget. Fries are standard.,1
"Someone took my order, I had to wait a little longer but they made it work the wait they made up for there mistake.",1
Better since no dinning inside,1
It's a McDonald's. They serve McDonald's here. Outdoor seating available.,1
Much better than the ones back home in the UK,1
Original McDonald's site museum.  Lot of memorabilia's. Donated by many people that bought or worked there.,1
Delivering a great experience anywhere in the world. Had a great meal.,1
"Not too crowded, so service was great",1
Very busy store but food is what you expect from a maccas,1
Thanks for my burnt buttermilk chicken sandwhich on my birthday ,1
Service is good and fast.,1
Love the fish o filet!!,1
Always friendly and quick service. As well as clean .,1
Service wasn't all the friendly.,1
Like the food it has parking bad thing it doesn't have a drive trough,1
Automated ordering kiosks are a great addition to cut down waiting time.,1
They actually have the glazed nuggets and the ice cream machine is always on !!,1
"Very fast, clean place. Perfect",1
They make the best hotcakes and frappes. No kidding,1
Location is awesome. Public restroom is lifesaver,1
I ever arrive here when I visit Pier cause it's cheaper than restaurants.,1
"It's McDonalds. It is what it is. You want fast, cheap, food then this is the place.",1

Nice place with outdoor seating area.,1
"Big 24 hour service restaurant, with outdoor seating.",1
"Love the world's largest McDonald's.  Has a kids Play Place, fun arcade upstairs, elevator, can order pizza and many other cool menu items.

Although usually busy, service is on pace. Got my meal in about 15 minutes.  I love this location. Found parking in about 10 minutes.",1
"This McDonald is one of the nicest and coolest McDonald I퐒e ever been to. It is a two story McDonald with a play place and an arcade. They offer non traditional menu options, such as build your own pasta, ravioli, pizza, cake, cheese cake, etc. it truly is a one of a kind McDonald",1
"The World largest McDonald's is a must to visit if you have kids. Besides the typical menu items, you can order pasta and pizza, customized to order. The dessert menu is not a large selection but pretty tasty. Only downside is the wait for the food ... about 30 minutes for us so the food was room temperature when we received it. Of course, the kids can and will spend hours exploring the play area and arcade (a few of the games were out of order and not many prizes to choose from). The place was packed when we visited. Overall a good experience!",1
"Hands down best McDonald's ever!! We loved the game room.
The prices were so reasonable, $25 was more than enough chips to play for as long as we wanted.
They restaurant was clean, the food was fresh and staff was friendly. It also had an elevator that goes to and from the game room and restaurant.",1
"World largest McDonald's. Food is the same, they have pizza and pasta too. The seating and ordering process was quick and easy, but actually getting the food on time together was a challenge.

Our burgers came in fairly fast 10 minutes or so, but pizza took 30 minutes+ from the time when we ordered it. I had to come down and ask for my order for them to give me the pizza.

Honestly, this worth a single visit, especially the playground if you have kids. If you looking for a quick bite, I would go to the other locations with less people and quicker service.",1
"This place is huge! Large play place and fun arcade.

Pizza at McDonalds?! Yup, we tried it. Overall it was delicious and had great flavor, although the crust was a little thin for my liking.

Overall fairly clean, floors were a little sticky. Bathrooms were clean.",1
We couldn't wait to visit!!! The atmosphere is a little hectic but the food is amazing! Definitely not food you would eat at your hometown McDonalds. Highly recommend the pesto pasta and chocolate peanut butter cake. Don't forget to visit the arcade and play center upstairs. Watch your child's face light up when you pull into the parking lot!! Highly recommend,1
"This location is nice and they deliver the food to your table. Only 4 stars though because the food was cold when it arrived. Probably would have given it 3 stars, but I got 2 extra nuggets in my happy meal.",1
"If you love McDonald's this is the place to go. They say it's the world's largest McDonald's. The menu is definitely a bit different with pizza, pasta and waffles as options. There was even an arcade upstairs and a elevator to get up. The sign says the restaurant is open 24-7 which is nice when leaving the amusement parks.",1
"We had the best time visiting the Largest McDonald's in the World!  This place is GREAT!  A must see if you're in the area!  I had the pizza and it was fantastic!  Next time, I'll try the pasta!  Staff was super friendly & helpful as well!",1
"Great experience. We came here on a recent trip to Orlando. They have a large selection of foods. They also serve pizza and pasta. There is a large bakery selection. On the second floor you can dine at one of the many tables or play in the large arcade. There is a large kids play area, but that is currently closed due to COVID.",1
"World biggest McDonald. They serve Pizza and Pasta here, I tried them both.
To be honest I didn know what to expect from the pasta but I guess i",1
"Very cool place, got food on menu you will not see at any other McDonald's.  The pasta was cool but not the best. Service was really good.  Had a good time...",1
"Overall a good experience at this McDonald's, the largest in Florida, if not the country a very big place. I actually did not go upstairs to the arcade area, just ate and ran. But additional options here, pizza and pasta, I had both and both equally good .  A little longer wait for those items, so expect the additional cook",1
"Came in on a Thursday night after a Magic game around 10:15 pm for the first time.  It was crowded with adults and children.  The ordering lines were long and playground was 70% full.  Seeing a few people with luggage and felt this could be there first or last meal in Orlando.  This is the biggest McDonald's in the world and the menus are different too, with pizza and pasta.  We tried the pizza and it was actually pretty good.",1
"Well, I guess I checked something off my bucket list I didn't even know I had... The WORLD'S biggest McDonald's?! How cool!! Pasta on dishware - at McDonald's?! Yes please! The place was a madhouse, but worth it for the experience. It was our first night visiting Orlando so we didn't let our kiddo run around the H U G E play area... I know, kinda mean. But the amount of children in it and not knowing how often it was cleaned had me a little nervous. Definitely worth the visit, even for just a cheeseburger! And KUDOS to all employees, this place is NUTS! AND a drive-thru?! Bless y'all.",1
"This was a great experience. I was staying at Orlando for a week and this was one of the places I wanted to go to. The pizza was really good, Mac tonight was also there which was mind blowing. My only complain was the pizza was pretty greasy, but other then that, I would recommend this for people staying at Orlando",1
Fantastic restaurant. You must visit when in Orlando. The service was good. The wait time for the premium menu items was reasonable. It was very clean and the staff was exceptional.,1
"The food was quality but service took a while.

I liked the food a lot. I had heard of the location having pizza and pasta so I got both. I also got a large fries a burger and drinks. Me and my party enjoyed the food and honestly the pizza was in some ways better than other pizza places.

Only con:
I'd recommend going through the drive through and not getting the special items only because the wait when you order pizza or pasta is increasing fast. Not sure if this is a regular issue but seems like when I have gone it's like this.",1
"Not entirely sure what I expected when going to the worlds largest 폦cDonalds?- I mean it just a fast food place right? Wrong.

The place is huge - brick ovens for thin and crispy pizzas, hand crafted pasta and speciality meal stations, the everyday McDonald kitchen then followed by a staircase to an arcade, playhouse and more sit down area.

The pizza was only $10 after toppings. It was a small personal pie - thin and crispy b",1
"Great place for the kids, playground  and playroom are great. I recommend  you the 30 min for just $5 play card while waiting for your food... it can take longer that other McDonald, very busy place.",1
This by far is one of the coolest McDonald's you will ever go to! It apparently is one of the largest in the world and is 3 to 4 stories tall! It has a special menu that is only designed for this McDonald's specifically which makes it extremely unique.. they have made to order pastas and pizzas.. now I went today at 1:15 in the afternoon in order to pizza and I got it within 15 minutes.. but before warned if you go during a busy time it could take up to 45 minutes.. and unfortunately that is the downfall dislocation is on Sand Lake Road which is in a tourism driven area off of International Drive and it is one of the busiest locations you will ever go to.. if you go during one of these peak times it is unbelievable how busy and how disorganized the location can actually be... but when they are firing on all cylinders it can be a fantastic experience... when you get the pieces or the pastas it is absolutely high and restaurant quality... it's literally amazing to go into a McDonald's for god sakes.. and get restaurant quality food of this caliber.. my pizza is Ace stone Brick Oven fired pizza and it is fantastic! And it was only a little over $11 with tax that is wonderful.. if you're ever in the area you should definitely try it 占쏙,1
"We are in Orlando Florida celebrating my son's 13th birthday so why not check out the world's largest McDonald's.
The place is huge with people from all places checking it out too.
It's 2nd floor is full of arcade games and a children's play area.
They have a pasta and pizza section with a brick oven.
They have multiple touch screen ordering kiosks with people always in queue.
I ordered online with the McDonald's app and picked it up in store or else I would have waited in line.
The whole store is bright and clean including the restrooms.
One thing you like about McDonald's it's the same flavor anywhere in the world you go.",1
This is the busiest McDonald's Ive ever been to. They have the process of customer care down to a science. If you order to go use a kiosk because eating in could take a while because a server has to walk the food over. They have a pastry cafe and the play area is massive. The employees are nice and gave great service. Just a heads up. I would avoid the drive thru between the hours of 7am-Midnight. Those are the times when people are either going or coming from theme park.,1
Kids love mickey d's so we had to stop by. You order from a kiosk and wait for your number to be called. Thought it was weird they didn't have the hot n spicy but it was pretty cool just to be there. They do have pizza and pasta but we opted to stick to the originals we know. Game room is small but again it's all about the experience.  Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed:),1
"This ""Big McDonalds"" is a very nice establishment. The staff seemed to be efficient and friendly. Even better than the food was the arcade $5 for 30 mins of unlimited play. (A few games are broken but that was okay) If you choose to buy credits instead you can buy things with the tickets you earn. (Like chuck'e'cheese)

Note: The playplace is currently closed due to covid, it will soon open according to my sources though.",1
This McDonald is known as the 폹iggest,1
"The Play Place, and mini arcade, on the second floor definitely make this place! The food is actually brought out to you which is nice and there are some novel items on the menu, but it's still just McDonalds (with higher prices). Is definitely worth stopping at if you have child that likes the Play Places!",1
"This McDonald's is definitely a must be location if you're a fan of the Big Mac, the pizza is surprisingly good the staff is super kind they constantly ask you if you need help her if everything is good.

There's plenty of tables to accommodate everybody, wait time and fast.

And if you're Coca-Cola connoisseur the soda fountain is perfect.

Super clean upstairs as a full arcade really cool if you have kids definitely stop by here you have a chance.",1
"This being billed as the largest McDonalds in the world, I had to stop and see it. It is certainly BIG. They have a dessert station, brick oven for pizza and huge play area for the kids. When I stopped it was busy and the employees were friendly and helpful. The restaurant and dining area appeared clean, which is difficult to do in a high volume fast food restaurant. I just grabbed a burger and shake and it was typical McDonalds.",1
This place is really busy. Not your average McDonald they serve pasta desserts and pizza at this location. We waited about 25-30 minutes for 2 happy meals. Only went here for the experience. I will staff the staff was very professional and polit,1
"BIGGEST MCDONALD'S IN THE WORLD!!!

We drove by this McDonald's and talked about how it was probably one of the biggest McDonald's in the world. After googling it it was! So we had to stop in!

It was definitely a cool experience. They offer More options than just the traditional McDonald's. We did build our own pasta and the pasta was excellent!

They also offer pizzas and different pastry options. Like cheesecake, cake, ice cream specialties.

This is a two-level McDonald's but looks to be four stories.

The first floor is the dining and kitchen. Second floor is a large play place that's two storage tall and they also have a arcade where you can earn points towards toy prizes. Kind of like Chuck e cheese..

We spent a few hours here It's spent around $30 for four of us. So it wasn't that bad.

Definitely cool to say you into the biggest McDonald's in the world!",1
"Pretty awesome place. On top of your standard items, they sell pasta, pizza and pastries. Surprisingly, the pizza and pasta was quite good, for McDonalds. The place also offers a very reasonable arcade, $5 unlimited play for 30 minutes. The only draw back to the timed purchase is that you don't earn tickets. They do have a trade in booth with prizes for your tickets.
Overall, we came here for the experience of going to the world's largest McDonalds and came out pretty satisfied with the while experience. Enjoy y'all!",1
"Massive size, diverse menu, and captivating ambiance. Arcade games, play area, and free Wi-Fi add to the fun. Minor wait times during peaks. Highly recommended for MCDs enthusiasts. The mcpizza and other menu items I have never seen before. The prices are higher and there are many, many people here. Cool to visit and see.",1
"Well, this was an experience. It was definitely fun for the kids. Arcade, and a huge play area, when I went to the play area was closed but it was big. This McDonald's has 2 floors, and the typical McDonald's food the twist there is they also sell pasta dishes and pizza. Wow! I know, right?",1
"Arcade and play place on second floor was awesome. This McDonald's offers pizza, pasta, and philly cheese steaks, just to name a few. Ordered from the regular menu however and fries were meh. Warm but soggy. There was a employee walking by asking if everything was ok which lead me to realize I didn't get juice for my happy meals which they retrieved.",1
"A nice big building that lives up to its hype. The entertainment can help the kids distract and enjoying been kids again.  Food was good pizza, chocolate cake woowwww.",1
We come here every time we are in Orlando and this was the first time we tried the pasta.  It was a little disappointing that you couldn't add chicken or sausage to it but was delicious nonetheless. The pizza and chocolate cake we also very good.  The store was well maintained and clean.  The staff was friendly despite the business.,1
"Playplace was large and 6 year old had fun. Nowhere for disabled 13 year old to sit while brother played. Nowhere to put drinks while playing without occupying eating tables. Not enough tables for guests. Long lines at kiosk. Kiosk menu needs easier ways to find special items. Many people asking for help. Over a half hour looking for parking, had to park at another business and walk over. Needs more space. Staff was all helpful, manager was friendly, Italian section interesting to watch, restaurant was clean. Nice experience, only needs more space.",1
Great service and the special menu they have it really good. The pizza it,1
Clean. Was surprised to see pasta and pizza as our local McD's does not have these items. The arcade is upstairs you can take an elevator or the stairs. It is really nice.,1
"This McDonald's has everything. Even pizza and pasta.
Bear in mind that it's a little expensive if you order items individually. So get the combos if you can that way you save money.

The place was totally renovated a few years back.

Nice place on International Drive.",1
"Well, obviously es a different place in comparatively other McDonald's, but be ready to a lot of people, childrens yelling and running, anyways still such a amazing place.they cook a good pizza that was oh! ..... Worth it.",1
For this to be the largest McDonald's I wasn't sure what to expect. My daughter wanted to stop by while we were visiting. It was very busy as to be expected. Staff was friendly. Really cool spot. They even have pizza and pasta on the menu. How awesome lol,1
"Since I'm known as ""Jimmy McRib"" I had to take the opportunity of visiting the world's largest McDonalds, even though it meant and extra hour and fifteen minute drive each way....  Anyways, this place is huge, and legendary among fast food junkies like myself for the fact that they serve pizza and pasta.  I would have been more impressed if they had the McRib too, but it was not to be, even at the world's largest McDonalds.

This was an incredibly busy place, even at 9:30pm.  There are tons of local hotels and tourists were everywhere, with most of them speaking a language besides English.  The restaurant wasn't the cleanest, but that had to be due to the fact that they are open 24/7 and always busy.  To my surprise, the bathrooms were very clean and nice.

Anyways, what is unique at this McDonalds:
- Hand dipped hard ice cream
- Multiple stories, with an arcade and playland upstairs
- A pizza and pasta section
- A big fish tank in the lobby

It was difficult to get into the parking lot due to construction and traffic, but there was plenty of parking.  The one side of the building has a giant neon Ronald McDonald which was cool.  I wanted to try the pizza or pasta, but unfortunately I had eaten a nice dinner about an hour earlier and only had room for a hamburger, which I ordered through the app.  It was pretty hectic inside, with tons of kiosks for ordering, which was helpful since they had different language selections to match the language of those ordering.  Some of my family got hand scooped ice cream, but it was a nightmare, as nobody was working that section, and we had to wait ten minutes after waiting in the busy line at the counter to ask for somebody to help us.  But, they eventually got their hard ice cream and it was good.

It was definitely neat to see this McDonalds, but it was a bit too busy for me, and the workers said that this was light traffic as compared to how busy it gets during the day.",1
"We had an amazing experience you ordered upfront and got your number, and they brought the food to you. You can personalize your own spaghetti   and pizza. It costs $15 the plate McDonald's food is the regular price as in all McDonald's it has a real big park upstairs and an arcade which is amazing for the kids to enjoy the only thing that I didn't like was that it was wayyyyyyy to HOT upst",1
"What a mind blowing McDonald's!
Punch in your order on the screen, pay, then find a seat and staff will find you to deliver your meal. Philly Cheese steak was our #1 pick, the stone oven thin crust pizza was great, and the pasta, considering it was from a fast food place was very good. Kids loved the arcade and play place too.",1
"The play place is still shut down due to COVID but the kids still had a good time. For some odd reason, my son LOVES going to McDonald even though we only go maybe twice/year and only on road trips. We had to stop here and he was thrilled. We did the $5/30 min arcade card (don",1
This is the worlds largest McDonald with the largest McDonald play place I퐒e ever seen in my life. Always quicker service inside i,1
"Really cool McDonalds with different menu items then most. Had a cheese pizza, blue Fanta slushie and a mcrib combo. Pizza was actually pretty good! Store is big but hectic and not the cleanest. Service was super fast, easy self checkout and brought to your table. Young fella delivering table orders was hilarious and a great employee.",1
"I퐉 surprised I hadn heard about this place before, but we were so glad we stumbled across this McDonald while driving along International drive! This place is amazing! Not only do they have unique extra food items lik",1
Cool McDonald's. They have an arcade and a pizza oven. Definitely not your average McDonald's. Pizza and pasta was great.,1
"McDonald's tourist trap?! Yeah but worth it.  McPizza was like a really good gas station/bowling alley pizza.
The alfredo pasta... over salty but otherwise, no worse than frozen stoffers or big box store brands.
The Pesto basil was actally not bad.   not Bronx NY italian by any means but yeah... gross.
Playplace for the kids. the video games are not bad.. same money drain as any arcade.",1
"I've obviously been to McDonald's before, but none like this! Tried the pizza and I'll have to admit, it's not perfect, but it's definitely not bad. Crust is a little thin for me. The activities are upstairs and it's like a small Dave & Busters. If you've never been, think about it. It's not a life changer, but fun to see at least once",1
"I love McDonalds. Not just their food, but the corporation as a whole. I think it awesome to visit McDonalds in other Countries for their ypical?off menu items. Although I퐒e been to Orlando various times, I never knew that this city housed a different McDonald experience.

I tried several versions of their pasta. I also tried their cheese pizza and peanut butter chocolate cake. All of these items were EXCELLENT.

I never thought I폻 eat pasta from McDonald",1
This is the nicest McDonald's I have ever been. The kids loved the arcade and the play place. We got a big Mac and pasta. It was very good.,1
"Its most def something else! Has a couple of floors. You go in and go straight to some screens and make your order. They have, pasta, pizza, sandwiches. Full package",1
"Was greeted with a welcoming fish tank as decor and friendly atmosphere from the staff, although it seems like most things in the menu were sold out. Food quality unfortunately did lack, the food does look visually appetizing but lacks in taste and quality. Would recommend stopping by if you want to experience something new.",1
"I had always wanted to go to this McDonald as a child but never got to. 30 years, as an adult I finally got to and it didn disappoint! Coolest McDonald ever!! Everything is supersized!",1
"Came around 9 pm and while it was busy, they did not take long to have the food ready. We used the touchscreen kiosk to order and they were super easy to use! We got a pepperoni pizza and some alfredo pasta. You can see them cook these, which was pretty cool. They have an arcade upstairs and the place has tons of places to eat.",1
"You're paying for what you're receiving. This is a crowded McDonald's. Keep that in mind, lines are long, and the food is the same as any other McDonald's except for the specials here, pasta, pizza, and desserts. People are trying their best, so don't expect a 5-star restaurant treatment. If you have time and a limited budget, this will fulfill your curiosity.
P.s. Always check for deals, they always have discounts.",1
"Who knew Orlando, FL has the biggest McDonald's in the world? I didn't until this week. I was pleasantly surprised! This was not a normal fast food dine-in meal. The atmosphere was pretty cool. The menu, I expected. I mean who can get a brick-oven pizza at McDonald's? Pasta, philly cheese steak sandwiches frozen ice cream, and customizable orders from the menu. Oh, I almost forgot about the arcade on the top floor. But what else should you expect since the restaurant is not far from Disney World!",1
"I think it's the largest in the world! 3 stories, MASSIVE kids playground, the serve pasta dishes on actual plates, a real pizza oven, scoop able ice cream parlor, elevators as well.
I think it's a test kitchen type of thing. Throngs of people. Also automatic trash compactors.",1
Was very busy and fast paced. But the kids loved it. Definitely a change from our regular McDonald's. Highly recommend the cheesecake 占쏙,1
"Unfortunately we didn have the best experience here. We waited almost an hour for our pizzas and many of the employees didn seem to care. Apparently they lost our order and like 10 others. It was chaos. Everyone was going up and asking for their money back. The only reason I퐉 giving 5 stars is because the manager, Mashawna, was super kind ",1
"This place was wicked crazy. I went with family, and we all did our own orders, and they missed at least 2 items for every single one of our orders. It was bizarre. I've never seen a McDonalds that serves pizza and pasta and has an arcade. The upstairs where the kids' playground and the arcade were was SO HOT. It was probably borderline unsafe for how hot it was for being inside the building. Especially since the kid's playplace was up there. I would be afraid of kids getting getting dehydrated and potentially even getting heatstroke.",1
My family really enjoyed this place!! They bring your food to your table. I love the different food options they have.,1
"This Mcdonalds is  two story with a playplace. Therr is also an arcade on the 2nd floor. We used the kisk to order the food and and sat on the 2nd floor, someone delivers. Seems to be steady all the time.",1
"Biggest McDonald's in the US. Has an arcade and huge play place upstairs. You can buy pizza, pasta, cakes, etc here. The kids loved it. The staff was friendly. Our order was right. Even has an aquarium. If you're hungry and want to see it its worth stopping.",1
"The biggest McDonald in the world is here in Orlando, Florida. Great space for share, enjoy, play, kids area for lots of fun ",1
Really fun place and they have freshly made pasta and pizza!! There are cool desserts there to try as well.,1
"The pizza is really good.  We got 3 and everyone liked it.  About the size of a medium pizza hut pizza, but oven fired (yes,  there are stone fired pizza ovens in here!) and thin crust. The Philly cheesesteak was really good and the chocolate explosion cake was tasty. 
If you order to eat there and order pasta or the cheesesteak, it comes on REAL plates/ pasta bowls.  Thought that was neat.

Not surprisingly,  our fries were cold and the Big Mac was missing a burger... pretty consistent with all other McDonald's on that point. 

Service was decent. Our order came up in a decent amount of time, considering the amount of orders they had coming in.

There are several different dining areas,  an arcade,  and a play place.
FYI, you c",1
A great unique McDonald's for  the first time pizza  there cooked infront of you  in the oven also ita largest  one  in USA with 2 floors  second floor for kids  arcade  and playground,1
"The best thing about the world's largest McDonald's could be the pizza, the cheesecake, the arcade, the jumbo playground.. all that is great but the BEST part of this McDonald's is the MacTonight animatronic mounted on the wall.
",1
This place was so good we went back a second time they have pizza and pasta AND CAKE at McDonald's I rate this place one of the best McDonald's experiences ever don't forget they have a giant play area upstairs that is free as a giant Jungle Gym area and then your best bet is to pay the $5 for 30 minutes of arcade time and you got 30 minutes to play all the games you want,1
This is a fun place to check out if you퐎e in the Orlando area. They have PIZZA which was pretty ok. There a arcade that my kids really enjoyed! It,1
"Fun to try McPizza and McPasta! Food was better than expected. Of course, the ice cream machine was down. The place is huge!",1
"Pizza here was actually not bad. I love that u can sit anywhere, and they come find u with the tracker number tents, I contemplated going into the jungle gym to see if they would go in lol but anyway it was great and they have a full arcade phillychese stake sandwich and pasta?? Lol didn't try those, but the cake slices they have looked awesome plus handscooped icecream come on, no brainer, just go before u leave Florida",1
"A bakery, a pizzeria, fish tank and arcade in a McDonald  Really amazed by what McDonald",1
"Don't expect to pay the price you would pay at home at this location. Although a little more pricey this trip to this mcdonalds was worth it.. they have a large arcade located on the second floor,, they have an ice cream and dessert station which serves chocolate cake and a few other types of cakes.This mcdonalds offered Belgian waffles(a little over $9), ham and cheese French toast for breakfast.",1
Wasn't sure what to expect when we visited the world's largest McDonald's at 1 am. 24 hour run however and a pizza???? Wowzers!!! Definitely an experience i will.not soon forget!,1
There is much more choice as in other MC Donalds to otherwise he is not the biggest in the world ,1
"I was shocked to go into a Mcdonald and order grilled chicken alfredo. This McDonald in Orlando, Florida, has a kid area and arcade. They also have pizza that can be purchased. It has two floors accessible with an elevator. Crazy but fantastic at the same time.",1
"This McDonald's is really nice. Super big and offers other foods other then McDonalds lol. It also has a second floor with more seating and a arcade section for fun. They offer a tap menu option and table service. So once your done ordering thru the self tap options you grab a number and have a seat.

We ordered our regular McDonald's food with the addition of a strawberry and banana waffle. Which was bomb.

I did feel like the store was a bit dirty. But it was probably cause it had a rush. After we left it calmed down and the employees were cleaning.

It is on the more expensive side. We ordered two Mcdoubles (which we had a coupon and applied it) large fries, a small drink and the waffle. The total was 19 bucks... It would have been 23... Lol",1
This location is said to be the largest McDonald's in the world! We stopped in after a day at Universal. We arrived after 11 and it was crazy busy. Our order took at least 30min before it was ready...but under the very busy circumstances it was understandable. They have unique dishes such as pasta and wood fired pizza which seemed very popular. Multi level seating....games room and various entertainment segments through the store as well to make the experience even better. Lots of free parking and dual drive thru. Overall this McDonalds is a flagship location for sure!,1
This was my first time visiting this location. The staff was very nice and service was great. The atmosphere was very good. We just didn't get to visit the second floor because the elevator was closed.,1
"This is a big, two floor McDonald's with not only the typical fries and burgers, but also pizza, salads and other foods. They have a kids playground and also an arcade and game area on the second floor.",1
Very nice and freandly place to eat food.A lot of space to play for children.Very nice Staff.,1
"Love this place. There's so much fun inside. After eating you can play some game the game  room is upstairs on the second floor. They're all types of games, it's remind me",1
This is the only McDonald's in the whole United States that serves pizza. I stopped here after passing through it because it looked like a beautiful building on the outside with multiple floors. The pizza we had was delicious.,1
"World's largest McDonald's and the only McDonald's which serves pizza. Which by the way was quite nice, freshly made there, with a good selection of toppings available. As well as the usual McDonald's food. Plenty of seating available, utilising multiple floors.",1
This is the largest McDonald's in the world!!!! The menu is much larger here as well. I ordered the Philly cheese steak. Giant playground and arcade on the 2nd floor. Cool experience!,1
"This is the coolest McDonald ever!!! You order on a kiosk, pick up a number sign, type in the number after you order and they bring you your food because the number sign has a gps tracker in it! It is two floors, serves pasta and pizza and also has a cake shop! The kids w",1
"The traditional burgers and fries were served Luke warm. As busy as the restaurant was, I was truly expecting hot and fresh. Perhaps had I ordered the pizza or pasta my experience would have been different. The service was nothing out of the ordinary, however, the staff was friendly. The best part of the visit was the arcade and play area, my kids absolutely love it, we were there for hours and hours.",1
This place was amazing. The arcade upstairs was superior. The fish tank with the different fish was cute and how amazing was it to see a brick oven pizza,1
"Highly recommended! The only McDonald like it and the largest one in the world. You can get fresh omelettes, waffles, pizza, and of course all the c",1
"World largest McDonald! It a 2-story location with a full kitchen serving unique dishes like pasta, pizza (from a brick oven!), waffles and more. There",1
"Fun stop with lots of different options, like cheese-cake, pizza and peanut butter cake, absolutely delicious! Very modern facility and cozy feel. Great spot for hot coffee and a piece of cake! The upstairs floor is a giant play place with arcade games as well. You place your order on the kiosks, take a table tag# and then find your table. They bring it to you. If your visiting Orlando, especially with kids, this is a fun stop!",1
Love this McDonald's!  Prices was great!  Worth the visit!,1
"This McDonald's has a pizza and pasta area made to order and is very good but like any McDonald's it's hard to find the staff that are willing to work in such a busy and crazy place. You cannot order with a real person inside. You have to order from a kiosk and they don't always get your order right or forget something. There is a drive through that is kind of like a race track and wraps around the building with 2 or 3 lanes and if your order is wrong, oh well, so be it. Just take it or leave it. There is a huge play place for kids and a second floor with an elevator.",1
"Really, the biggest McDonald's. The food was good. Bought pizza, fries, and pasta. Kids liked it very much. If you are in Orlando, you should give a try here. Depending from where you drive  from, it may be difficult to enter.",1
"Wow, a great place has an arcade , my stepdaughter had so much fun first time, was on vacation fron CT... if u haven't been great to the kids ..",1
"It was my first time, and it was a pleasant experience.
Surprisingly, having pizza at McDonald's wasn't as weird as I thought.",1
Biggest McDonald's I've ever seen .This place was huge with so many employees and an expanded menu including pasta dishes and pizza... This of course is in Orlando and open 24 hrs.,1
"That was fun!  Huge McDonald's!
Went there at 10pm and hung out and kids played until about 11:20pm - but you would think that it was lunch time with how busy they were. We were surprised at how fast the food came to our table and the staff were friendly.  Well done McDonald's!",1
"Came on a Sunday afternoon on March break and I hated every minute of the experience

My family however had a pretty good time, so I didn bother to explain to them the downsides of mas",1
Most unique McDonalds I퐒e ever been too. It huge! There is a very large play area for kids and an ,1
Had to stop here on our way home from Florida. My kids were super excited see this location. They had fun playing in the playground and arcade and we even enjoyed breakfast before getting back on the road.,1
"Very big place, i had to order from a kiosk but I'm used to it and fine with it,

I ordered three things came out to about 7$, very decent i ate inside and in about 5 minutes a worker came to my table with my order.

The customer service was very nice and up-stairs they have a play place for the kids, they also serve pizza, pastas and cake here so it surprised me but overall great experience I will say because of the play place there is naturally a lot of parents bringing their kids so it can be very loud.",1
"Largest Mcdonald at the word they said, very good, beside regular manu they have pasta, pizza and steak sandwich's on subs, also big arcade on the secound floor, went for dinner, place was really busy, thats the reason i didnt take pictures from the inside.",1
"The food was alright, it's one of the biggest McDonald's but quality can be improved with the fish sandwiches being burnt on the edges and burgers were not properly organized within the bun in the big mac, just a bit of feedback compared to regular McDonald's restaurants. Other than that my family had a great time enjoying the upstairs atmosphere and playground.",1
Been here a couple of times kids love it finally tried the pasta it was surprisingly good,1
"So i don usually give fast food more than 3 stars but this place was comically huge.
Giant arcade and large play area.
There is even attempt to make like omelette and stuff.  I even saw brick stoves like you would see pizza cooked in. Did I mention a fish tank?

It did take a while to get our food and it was typical McDonald",1
Best experience ever. The food was shockingly good. I did pizza and build your own pasta. Customer service was phenomenal.  Restaurant was very clean and we didn't wait long on our food. Can't wait to visit again.,1
Obviously one of the most amazing McDonald's I've ever seen. Three stories and a two-story playland. They had premium scoop ice cream and pasta with Alfredo on the menu. Are you kidding me? Pizza and Alfredo at McDonald's? You betcha. Biggest Playland I've seen in the McDonald's for years? Has it. The classic Mac tonight guy playing a piano in the corner? Has it. Easily the best McDonald's I've been to since I was a kid 30 years ago in Las Vegas.,1
"A fun place to go to maybe once or twice. Went during the weekend. The ordering kiosk lines were slow because people don't know how to use ordering kiosks. McDonald's was out of pasta but they had pizza. I was bummed because I wanted to try the pasta. I ended up ordering a regular meal you can get at any McDonald's.

Seating was easy to find and the tables were clean. Employees were helpful. The arcade upstairs seemed pretty cool and definitely unique. We didn't play any games or play in the play place. I enjoyed seeing Mac Tonight playing the piano. Next time I'll get some dessert.",1
Being local we try to stay away from the busy tourist places but this McDonald's is so big we really don't mind. We like the fact they bring your food to your table and the employees try their best to keep this place clean. The customers tend to be rude and push people or not say excuse me in this establishment.,1
"Did you know McD in Orlando has a Philly cheesesteak. Yea, they really don't.... it's a big mac minus the sauce on a hoggie roll. But good job trying new things.",1
Breakfast was hot and fresh. They had an omelet sation with Belgium waffles.,1
"This is an amazing gem sitting on a corner looking not much like any McDonald's I had ever seen before.   The second floor confused me, but the logo looked similar to McDonald's.  They have pizza, cooked there in the restaurant.  I know because my order was called before my pizza was ready.  At any rate, walking through the arcade upstairs was a nice way to wait for my pizza.  I only gave 4 stars for service because the staff seemed to not be trained for customer service.  Perhaps they were simply tired or busy, but it wasn't up to the standard of typical McDonald's when I visited.  I will return next time I am in Orlando!",1
"By far the best and most amazing McDonald's in the history of the world. It's even hard to imagine it as a McDonald's. Super clean, extremely friendly and helpful staff. A second floor with a massive arcade and crazy-huge kid gym (shut down due to covid hysteria :( ). Loved this place. Bring your kids!",1
"Very average McDonald's experience overall. Was cool because of the whole ""largest McDonald's"" bit, but it was extremely hectic inside with kids running and screaming everywhere. Took a while to even get the opportunity to order, then food took a while to get to us, which is understandable since it was so busy. Ice was out in 3/4 soda machines. Not a very clean place either. Pizza was alright. Very dry, flavorless crust, pretty soggy and could have used more time in the oven/ the oven could be hotter. If they put like 20% more effort into the flavor of the pizza it would be a lot better. Onion ""slivers"" were also just onion chunks. Not a big deal, just a little misleading. But what else you expect from a McDonalds. Food is a little pricier than the McDonald's I'm used to as well. Would probably have a better experience making the effort to dine elsewhere.",1
"Biggest McDonald's in the world, has special menu items (pizza and pastas [don't sleep on the ravioli bolognese.]) Being it's the world's biggest, it was a madhouse inside, some kiosks down completely, some just the payment part not working. Overall, food was good, inside was a zoo, but you can only get the special items inside.",1
This has to be one of the best McDonald's I have ever been to hands down. While disappointingly I did not visit the upstairs with the arcade machines I can rave about the pasta and pizza they make and serve! The pasta can rival olive garden and starts at 10.99 and you are able to customize it how you want. Definitely would recommend both the pasta and even the pizza! I'm pretty picky on pizza and the pepperoni pizza was actually pretty good! I usually would HATE brick oven pizza as I find they taste burnt always but this was a good pizza! Definitely worth checking out at least once if you are in the area! It is a little busy most times but even with that the wait is no worse than a regular McDonald's.,1
This McDonald's in Orlando is huge! It was very busy but they were very fast. The food was very fresh as they pretty much have to make everything to order. Definitely worth a visit just to see them make pizza at a McDonald's.,1
"This is not your ""mommas mcds"".  This was fantastic.  Big,  huge,  wonderful.   A truly fun,  unbelievable McDonald's experience.   They have a dessert bar.  They have pizza,  and pasta,  a wood fired oven.   You have to see it,  to believe it!!",1
"Was told that we had to come here because it is the biggest McDonald's in the country.  It is huge, there is an elevator that takes you up to a kids playplace and full size arcade.  They also off menu items that aren't on a ""normal"" McDonald's menu like build your own pasta and pizza",1
Had a drive thru order for EIGHT. Every meal was correct and picture perfect. All the fries were the crisp and hot. And the staff was awesome. Best McDonald's I've been to.,1
Fun to visit the largest McDonald's in the world. Highly recommend,1
"Because it is the largest McDonald, it is a place where you go there so you can scratch off your bucket list.
It is very crowded,  very noisy,  a lot of kids, of course.
They have pizza, coffee, and sweets beside the regular menu.

I think the staff works hard and as fast as they can. In my opinion,  the management has to step in big time in order for this place to run flawsly.

The self order machines two or three didn't work,  so it added to the slow service.
Upstairs is an arcade game room. You need coins. It is very stuffy and even more noisy . But, as I said, a place to visit one's in a love time, so you know you did it!",1
"We went with our kids, and of course, they wanted to eat and play on up stairs, so, a friendly worker brought us our order  but there was no station services on up stairs, and the same time we had to go downstairs to serve our sodas, look for napkins, sauces and straws",1
This is by far the best McDonald's.  I love the options not on other locations menus.  The pizza was wonderful and freshly made to order.  I wish I lived closer because it would for sure be my go to fast food restaurant.,1
"This McDonald's has a huge, amazing inside playground and arcade (2nd floor). Beautiful fish tanks for the kids to look at while you are ordering. It does get a little loud when the kids scream. Plenty of tables for everyone. Order downstairs and take a number - they bring it to you. Super nice when you have difficulty walking g like I do. However drinks are downstairs. Handicapped parking in front of the doors. An elevator to the second floor and handicap tables with half booths upstairs. My neices love this McDonald's!",1
"Chaotic has alot going on being the world's largest McDonald's many options not on a typical menu examples being pizza, pasta, pilly cheese steak, Belgian waffles and many more a giant arcade and kids play place on the second floor which can be accessed by an elevator",1
Kids had a great time! Hard to find play areas these days. Great selection of arcade games. Our cheeseburgers were cold however i saw more customers opt for the pizza and philly cheesesteak.,1
It's a huge McDonald's and has a nice choice of other foods that are Not your basic options.,1
We got out food VERY fast and they even have pizza. The burger was a tad too dry but nothing I couldn't fix. Service was fast for how busy it was. It's also a very modern building!,1
"Huge McDonald's. Unique items at Orlando location. Pizza and pasta. Cheesecake was sold out. Arcade but prize and play area are closed. You can order at kiosk or wait in line for cashier. Soda is not self-serve, free refill. Expect a long wait (approximately 20-30 mins) if you are waiting for pizza and pasta, it's understandable though. They do deliver to table. I didn't see the Belgium waffle on menu.",1
So many unusual items!  Got the pepperoni and mushroom pizza and the ham and cheese french toast.  CRAZY!  Really enjoyed the experience and would highly recommend everything stop here.  The chocolate cake was pretty good too!,1
It was to crowded but food was good and there are so many other options like pasta that you cant find in regular stores. The second floor was amazing for the little ones with big playgroung and Arcade section. Would love to come back on a not to busy day. We visit Sunday at noon.,1
"Awesome McDonald's to visit and eat. The food was delicious and the customer service was great. You place your order at the machine and they will deliver the food anywhere you are. I love the arcade area and there was plenty of seating. The atmosphere was relaxing and restrooms,food area,drink area and arcade were clean. They have 2 stories and both were very well maintained. I definitely recommend visiting this McDonald's with your children. They will have lots of fun.",1
"biggest in the world - but still a mcd's. the golden arches doesn't really do anything impressive - i mean, disappointment is kinda expected.  Walked in with no expectations.  I like that they have other food besides the regular burgers. was impressed by the brick oven pizzas they were putting together. we tried ordering breakfast (ALL DAY) but they were out of so many entrees... like OUT! not sure how you run the world's biggest McD's and not have stuff on hand at 2.30 in the afternoon. It wasn't super crowded. Love the self-ordering kiosk (that's what you get for demanding $15/hr for fast food wages). Love even more that you can order from your app and just go pick it up at the counter. Our fries were as expected from the golden arches.  the top floor has seating and an arcade.  the main floor has a lot of seating areas with plenty of window seating. for it being the world's biggest, it really didn't seem THAT big ... also, they could have more of a variety of entrees / foods / dishes that is different from a regular neighborhood mcd's - just a thought.",1
The service was very slow compared to Ireland and our order was mixed up even though we ordered on the self service machines. The soft drinks were flat but otherwise no complaints.  American McDonalds burgers taste quite different to Irish Mcdonalds.,1
"Very loud and busy. Very big inside with McDonald's pizza place too
Upstairs is a big kids play place
But you will have to wait about 20 -30 mins too receive your order
So that a downside and its very crowded so if u have a problem with crowded places don't go inside because it alot of people inside ordering and waiting and it's just to much",1
"Nice, big McDonald's on the International Drive. The place was packed and too noisy. The service was fast, though, and had decent food. Will try again for sure.",1
"Love this McDonald's, it has a great variety of food, I think this is the only McDonald's that serves pizza and real dessert, like this peanut butter chocolate cake. Check it out!",1
It was cool definitely check it out!,1
"I was so excited to visit the worlds largest McDonalds even though McDonalds is not one of my favorite places. If you are a parent you understand. Lol. But this one has so many more options to choose from. I got pasta and my son got pizza. Both were very good. They even have a separate desert counter.
If you have little ones you definitely want to check this place out. The Play Place is huge.",1
"Always super busy, the pasta is mid, the pizza is surprisingly delicious, the deserts are fantastic! the vibe is pretty fun, a very cool playground and arcade upstairs (with flappy bird of all things) always fun to stop here when I hit Orlando :)",1
MCpizza is the best item in the menu.,1
"Place is great for kids. Usual McDonald's food, but cost a lot more. Better to go to a different McDonald's location to eat and Epic just got play and fun.",1
"Loved the look of the store. Kids had a good time in the arcade. One part of my party waited over an hour for their food.  Went to ask about it three times and was told it was on its way.  The fourth time, I went to the counter to ask about the order and was told that their system went down and that It had lost the order. Little did they know that I currently work for McDonald's, and I asked the manager how they were still taking orders if the system went down and no one was on the phone with tech support. All of a sudden, they found the order and rushed it to us. I feel that what had happened is that the order was served off and no one wanted admit to it.",1
This was actually a pretty cool McDonald. Needed to experience it. Service was quick especially with the amount of,1
I was amazed that this was a McDonald's. The wide variety of items offered outside of the normal McDonald's menu was impressive. When I went some of those stations were closed but if I'm ever in Orlando again when there are open I will definitely try them. Can you imagine getting pizza from McDonald's or ice cream?,1
"Great location, very cool place to visit especially if you have kids. Very cool that they have pizza and pasta. Even omelets and waffles too. Play area is the coolest part. With arcade too. Only down side was that the restroom  were fu*king gross. (Mens restroom) over all tho it was great !",1
"The best McDonald's I have ever visited.  It is nice and incredibly clean.  At this McDonald's, you can get both burger, pizza and pasta, something I haven't seen at other McDonald's.  On the first floor there is a large play area for children and an arcade.  However, one must be aware that because of the play area, there is some noise on the first floor.  But far less noise in the ground floor.",1
Food was good and service was great,1
Different food options from the traditional mickey D's but we went for the arcade. Can easily spend a few hours here on a hot or rainy day and not break the bank.,1
"If you're looking for an atypical Mcd's the. This is it. Housed in the heart of International Drive, this world record holding burger joint holds its own. Two stories of seating, a GIANT play area for kids, and even a little video game section. You don't just get burgers and nuggies here, they have stone fire pizza, pasta, and cake! It's an experience for sure. Just a heads up, you'll be paying a slight premium for the whole event. Not much but you'll notice. I'd suggest ordering on the app and getting a discount;)",1
"Came here to florida for work purposes and brought the kids. Food was good,overpriced, but good and came out quick. We came around 9:30am on a sunday. I was happy to see they have the bagel sandwiches back as texas doesn't have them yet. My boys played on the playground and the arcade. Half the games didn't work but would take money off the card anyways so we just played the ones that did work so we could get prizes and leave. Crowded and loud but fun.",1
A big and busy McDonald's with more choices than usual.,1
If you haven't been here you need to see it!!! Updating Review this place is still very interesting definitely bringing the kids. food hasn't changed pizza is fantastic.,1
"I went here with a lot of expectations so I'm a little disappointed.  However, its pretty great place still. This place is like a mini Chucky cheese married a McDonald's and its give birth to this biggest McDonald's.  Its 2 floors with limited parking.  They do have wood fired pizza.  I wish I tried its.  The pizza looked good.  The staffs were super friendly.  One McDonald's employee went around asking how everyone was doing.",1
"-Pizza is from a Fire oven - turned out good!
-Philly Cheesesteak was also very good
-AC upstairs was struggling, was pretty hot when we went
-Kids sweatted up a storm from playing at the play place which was also warm
-We did not have any issues finding seating, have tables for big groups on the 2nd level (8 of us)",1
Biggest McDonald,1
"The staff treats people like an actual customer...There everyday practically (doordash driver). Amazing staff... One thing I hate is having to mix my own flurry when they usually mix it up for you. Other than that little flaw... I definitely feel safe, Welcomed, No rude staff. When their busy, we have to wait a 1H for the food, when their not.. we get our food within 20-30 minutes. Surely recommend bringing small kids to the play area.",1
I lived in fl. all my life and this McDonald's location is the biggest I have been 2. It has an upstairs & downstairs for seating. Upstairs also has a game room. I didn't order anything because the prices seem higher than normal. That was understandable because it's located in a tourist area. I just amazed of how it look inside. Seems like a great place 2 sit & eat with the family.,1
"Multi-level place. Loud but fun. Like a Chuck-E-Cheese inside a Mickey D's.

Lots of games on 2nd level. Plenty of tables. Fast service. Kiosk fairly easy to order & pay.",1
"Even though the stars make no sense on my review, the experience of a different McDonald's is definitely worth it.

The place isn't the cleanest, service isn't the fastest or most efficient, and the atmosphere a bit frantic; it's worth a visit to have a pizza or decent diner breakfast from McDonald's. Worth the experience.",1
"This was, indeed, a large McDonald's.
The entire upstairs is an arcade, and playground, maybe.
It comes with the problems you might expect in the world's largest McDonald's.
Still, it's the WORLD'S largest McDonald's.
The upstairs bathroom was real small, still,
I have been and you haven't!
The Big Breakfast with Hotcakes was excellent.",1
"Great time! Never though i would eat a stake and egg breakfast in McDonald's. It was a bit overcrowded for my liking. Other than that? Food was hot, food was cooked to order. Would go back again!",1
This place is crazy packed. Our food came out at a decent time. It's worth a stop to experience it.  Just be prepared to be in a crowd.,1
Be prepared to spend $10-$13 per person. Clean bathrooms also. Staff is friendly and helpful with the ordering. Upstairs is wild and crazy.,1
"Apparently, it is the biggest McDonald on Earth. It is a 2 story building that offers specialty cakes, pasta, and custom built pizzas. Also, it has a huge indoor playground for kids as well as the arcade room.

The Food.
We tried pizza and, surprisingly, it was pretty good having in mind it came from the fast food chain. Touch screen menu had enough options of ingredients to customize pizza order based on personal taste. Keep in mind that some toppings cost extra. I would rate pizza 7-8 points out of 10.

The Ambience.
This McDonald is clearly a touristy, family place which is good. Also, the service was pretty quick given the location",1
"The food is good. But they are understaffed and struggling to provide food on time. It takes hours even to get a slice of cake or coffee . For pizza, the wait time was horrible.",1
"This is the first McDonald I have went to that creates pasta and pizza! Believe it or not, it taste good! I퐉 super surprised my dish come out delicious! However, everything come with a price. It is a bit expensive than every other McDonald since one plate of customize pasta or coal customized pizza can cost from $12-$20 depending on what you want. It is easily for 3 people to spend at least $60-$100 at this place! I don recommend their philly ",1
The place was a little dirty and it took almost 30 minutes to get our food. But they had a good variety of food. My teens still want some more McDonald's pizza,1
"Large, very busy McD's with a larger menu. Food was a bit slow, and it was hard to find a table. Pizza was surprisingly good.",1
"This is the World's largest McDonald's by square footage. They have  play place, arcade, and unique menu items like pastas, salads, Belgian waffles, a bistro menu, and dessert options you can't find at any other location. Don't fear because they still have the  fries,  chicken nuggets, and ",1
So it is my birthday today and I wanted to try something I have never tried in my 47 years. A McDonald's pizza or as they call it a McPizza (there are only 3 McDonald's that serve them). The Pizza and pasta were truly awesome. We did the ordering from the kiosk and proceeded to our seat. Everything was great except they didn't bring my husband's latte. So I asked the gentleman that brought the food to bring the drink. We were nearly done by the time we received it and it was incorrect. After eating we went to get the correct one and the manager had an attitude and basically filled a small cup up with milk and handed it to us. Overall the food was great. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because of the issue with the drink. We will be back but next time we will get water.,1
"My kids love the indoor playground.
The whole place was sticky, sweaty and stinky!. I don't know what's wrong with the a/c but a lot of people could be the reason. Keep your kids close at all times.",1
"A really fun experience.  So many food options.  It was easy to find vegan-friendly food.  The quality of food was about cafeteria quality but it still beat having to eat something considered regular food at this place.  They have a large indoor play area, an arcade, fish tank, a sundae kind-of station.  The kids loved it!",1
Neat experience but dirty restaurant. We did come around 11pm and they were very busy. Husband did love the pizza.,1
"One of the world's largest and most interesting McDonald's. Located in the busy area right in the hub of Orlando off of iDrive.

This is a two-story McDonald's hosting some of the world's rarest menu items including both pasta and pizza and a ton of cakes and other amazing trees.

A great place to visit if you're looking for something fun and interesting in Orlando. If you're a fan of McDonald's, this is the one you're going to want to check out. Although it is always very busy because it is in the downtown tourist hub right near Universal Orlando, I drive, and many other great tourist destinations.

This McDonald's features both counter service and has multiple kiosks of available so you can go up and order easily. There is a drive-thru available.

This is currently the only place in the world serving McPizza with several options available as well as customizations. This is also one of three places in the world including the Philippines and Italy that are currently serving McDonald's pasta. Definitely an interesting menu item to try out if you're looking for something a little different. They also have a full ice cream and cake shop with plenty of dessert choices.

Upstairs host a full gaming arcade with air hockey, skiball, arcade games, and a ticket area to collect prizes once you're all done.

If you're looking for an interesting affair and a little bit of a different McDonald's experience, this is the place to visit.",1
all food was good but pricey.,1
"It was pretty cool for a McDonald's!
They should all be this way .
It's kind of like Chuckie Cheese with the arcade upstairs.
The pizza and pasta were good.",1
"This is the best McDonald's in the country! The service is on point! They are friendly and always looking to make your experience here better. The place is spotless. As for the kids, this place offers a 3 story playground along with video games. But what makes this place special is the staff in particular Perrin. This gentleman is at your service with a smile and a great personality. I can't say enough good things about this place! You need to relax and let the kids go after a long day at the park...? This is it!!",1
"Yo first time here. This joint got a play area, I퐉 talking arcade style on the second joint. ",1
"The rooms were a nice size.  The place was very clean 12 rooms, 12 bathrooms, 2 refrigerators, 2 dishwashers, and pool w sauna, attached to the house.  It was completely furnished from plenty of towels to dishes.  I will most definitely be back. Oh, and did I say the maintenance staff was very efficient one call that's call. Two family rooms w 60 plus inch T.V. s and 50 inch T.V.s and up in each bedroom.",1
"First of all keep on mind this is McDonald's a very upscale McDonald's but it is it. My family and I really enjoyed it here. It was very clean although crowded assistance was given with processing our order and the employee explained how I can get a discount through the McDonald's app, he was very patient.  It is very large and the game room was great! The other employees were very nice and took our trays and trash. The was McDonald's flavor, but the pizza was good. The cookies were so fresh and warm, very delicious. More than the regular McDonald's food options. Overall a great visit!",1
Highly recommend!! Pizza was 占쏙,1
"I never imagine we could eat a great pizza, pasta and Philly Cheesesteak at Mc Donald, but the true is they are amazing, a must try if you visit this specific place.",1
"This location is huge for a McDonald's. It has play area and arcade games. It also offers customize pizza and pasta menu, in addition to the usual offering. Prices are slightly more compared to other locations, which is justifiable given the amenities it offers. I saw some reviews complained about slow or bad service. I didn't notice that on my visit.  Overall, I think it worths a visit if u happen to be in the area.",1
It's the largest McDonald's that I have ever been to. It has a second floor that has an arcade and a quiet side for those who prefer technology.  The menu is huge you can get just about anything from your typical Mc care to pizza and great ice cream desserts.,1
"Food is okay just like another McDonald's but they have pizza, service is okay but always busy, building is amazing for kids with the playground and arcades.",1
"I dint get to go up stairs....
But it is well kept and so dang busy...
The fishes seemed hungry and lethatgic",1
surprisingly fast for such a large busy location. After time at Disney it is nice to have a more affordable meal.,1
Best McDonald's I have ever visited. This is one of the few McDonald's in the USA that still serve pizza. On top of the coal fire build your own pizza they have custom pastas and build your own omelets. The jungle gym for the kids is huge and they bring your food right to the table. The trash cans are automatic as well as the seat covers. To add icing on the cake (which they also have at their dessert bar ) there is an arcade with a prize table. This is honestly the best McDonald's experience I have ever had.,1
"If there is any McDonald world wide that deserve a five star rating then this is the only location that must get it . McDonald here offer pizzas , subs , desert bar , kids playing area with arcade, amazing service ",1
It was good but very crowded. They have extended menu from regular Macdonald which I recommend to try.,1
This places was crazy busy. Took 45 minutes to get our food. The play area was  a fun experience.,1
World's biggest McDonald's it is really cool you should see this when you're in Orlando 2 stories tall ginormous playground and arcade and they have special menu items I got the brick oven pizza that was cooked in an actual Brick Oven it was actually pretty good and cheap but the service is very slow it took them 30 minutes just to give me my food.,1
"The kids had a blast! Very hectic and tons of folks are there. You order at a kiosk and then they bring your food to you. Our food arrived in an orderly time. Although, the fries were cold and we had to send them back. The kids enjoyed the play area and game area. I recommend you let your kids wear socks or bring some. Otherwise they run around the nasty floor barefooted when they are on the playground. They also have an icecream and dessert area.",1
I퐉 a very picky eater and for me a once in a while treat is great and saying that there is no vegetables in t,1
"Nice McDonald's with bigger menu selections like pasta and pizza, separate dessert area, play structure, game room, and decorative items like fish tanks, paintings of McDonald's characters. 2 floors of dining",1
Super cool and fun international McDonald's! We loved the Wood Fired Pizza and all the different languages spoken there as well as the Arcade upstairs.,1
"This place is like WOW you'll walk in and say is this McDonald's or what ,great foods here you'll be amazed before you walk all the way in",1
"We finally made it to the Biggest McDonalds!! It was a Thursday so it was busy but not packed. Line moves quickly and they bring your food to you. The play area was fun with lots of places to climb but, our let down was the arcade! The selection was ok and some were out of order. Not to mention you don't really rack up too many tickets. Over all, it was fun, food was fresh and it's McDonalds so totally kid friendly!",1
I give this place five stars because i here stayed overnight for a challenge on my youtube channel quinnotfound and you guys never caught me lol.,1
It was a fun experience but our food was cold and our fries were not salty. I'd go again because I would like to try the pizza and pasta.,1
"One of the best McDonald's in my travels. Great food and great customer service. And the only McDonald's that I know that serves pizza and more! If you're heading to Universal and Island's of Adventure, make a stop at this McDonald's.",1
"Very cool McDonald's with arcade, play place, pizza and pasta. Pasta was actually pretty good. Kids had a great time at the play place.",1
"Pretty chaotic inside during dinner time. Not a quick trip. Plan to stay a little while. Pasta is ok, Alfredo sauce was a little bland. Your able to customize your pasta with different meats and veggies but be prepared to pay an extra $1.50 each on top of the pasta already starting at $10.99 Pizza is phenomenal! Thin crust but not too crispy and very flavorful. All of your favorites like normal but with an actual working ice-cream machine!! ",1
"The worlds largest McDonald's is amazing, a two story playland plus arcade games and an updated menu where you can choose waffles, build your own omelette, pasta and pizza plus delicious desserts. It's a great place to bing the kids on a relaxing day on Orlando; don't take my word, come see for yourself!!!",1
"Still maintaining a indoor Playspace with arcade on 2nd floor. Elevator access available, and restrooms on both floors. Delivery for food to tables both floors, ordering on first floor only. Double drive-thru lines. Open 24hrs",1
Big place haven't seen a McDonald's like this one two floors to eat and play its like a McDonald's and a chunky cheese in one recommended to every one if your in the area,1
"Definitely worth coming inside to see everything the location has to offer.  Between the specialty menu items like ""build-your-own-pizza"" or Belgian Waffles there's over 50 menu items.  Try some hand-scooped ice cream or bakery cakes with your chicken nuggies.  Full arcade upstairs with huge Play Place.",1
Huge McDonald's! Well staffed and looked cleaner than most location I have visited. Very busy but service was fast. There are plenty of seats in upstairs floors.,1
Great big place for families. Games and playground.  They deliver your food to your table. Very clean and friendly staff.,1
"Awesome McDonalds with a huge dining and play area along with a full arcade. They offer both make your own pizza and pasta which is a unique and fun experience to create via the kiosks. All the food was good and was delivered directly to our table. The staff was pleasant and helpful. Definitely check out the USA's largest McDonalds if you can, you won't regret it!",1
Pizza wa excellent. Pasta was good but peppery.  Normal McD food was similar to others.,1
Not your regular McDonalds and this model would be cool to spread across the USA.... Pleasent staff clean attentive aware of needs..... PERRIN WAS A GREAT Host... Made our morning awesome we will be back next year when we are in town for the PGA show! ,1
"Great food. Staff is amazing, unlike any other Mcdonalds you would go to!!!! Better to come here not during its peak",1
"The customer service was okay and the service was a little slow, but the food was probably the best I",1
It's a 2 story level McDonald's and they have many kiosk they would like you go check out that way but still had a guy on a register. They have all the usual food and them they have pizzas you can order and pasta. I got the tortellini Alfredo with chicken. It was very good. It's just insanely crowded,1
"Lovely meal I ate inside. Staff was pleasant and was available to assist with the ordering board. A cash registered was also available, If you choose not to order from the display board.  Love it.",1
Nice place for kids but need more staff to keep up with the cleanliness of the place. Nats flying around by trash cans and over your food is horrible. Floors were horrible to walk on.,1
"This is a really awesome Macdonald's. Not like any other. Truly unique. It offers a lot especially for kids with an aquarium, slides, and gaming areas. Technology is awesome with individual kiosks for placing orders and service is fast and friendly. We enjoyed it. Plus they serve pizza. All the benefits of the usual McDonald's with bonuses. It's also very clean and modern.",1
"Best restaurant we went to in Florida. Yes I'm serious. Went to 6 restaurants and McDonald's was the best one. Kindest waitstaff, great food, clean eating area. All around Best restaurant experience.",1
"This is by far the biggest McDonald I퐒e ever been too, the 1st level has seating, the registers to order with a person or you can place your order in the kiosk machine, the 2nd level has an Arcade, ",1
Lots of different things on the menu. Kinda cool if you need a snack on vacation! Probably won't spend much time here,1
"The gold standard for all McDonalds and on to of that, you can get pizza and pasta!   You order from the kiosk and take a tent number, get your drink cups from the cashier and find a table.  Your food will be made to perfection (not exagerating, all of our food looked as good and put together as it does on the menu photos).  There's an arcade on the third floor, stop in if you have a chance you won't regret it.",1
One cleanest McDonald's I've ever been inside to eat in. Very fast service pizza was surprisingly good. I would eat here any day.,1
Hard to believe this is a McDonald's. Beautiful building and they even have a brick oven for cooking pizza! They also have a dessert bar and an aquarium. Even if you don't really like McDonald's food it's cool just to check it out.,1
Best McDonald's I have ever been to...it has an awesome game room...like Dave N Busters!  Kids win tickets to exchange for cheap toys....It has a large play gym with multiple slides...computers at tables for ordering or playing games...iced cream bar...etc...,1
Sat upstairs.  Brought food to our table. No drinks machine upstairs.  6 kids. Had to go downstairs to get drinks. Then realized they messed up my order. Still a good experience.  Note. Large family sit downstairs.,1
"This is the largest McDonalds I have ever seen massive two story second level has elevators and stairs and features a really nice play room for the kids and arcade room as well. They serve omelets,cake,cheescake,different flavors of icecream hard serve, woodfired pizza and pasta. Staff was friendly they even feature table service.",1
"We have always visited this branch when we are in Orlando. As always, food prices in this particular location is very expensive. You can not get the morning deal of $2.39 compared to other location in. South FL. It is $3.79 for chicken biscuit and if you want to add a hasbrown, it becomes  $6.79 and since you like to add a drink, you have to add $0.60 for a sweet tea. Small size hot coffee is $1.99. Still a wonderful experience since they had the place renovated. We experienced our first kiosk ordering here when it was first introduced.",1
This is a great family place you can let the little ones run around the place is so clean and sanitized.  This McDonald's has a pizza restaurant within the same building as well so I find that to be a bonus. McDonald's service was friendly and fast and fresh so thanks.,1
"World largest McDonald that serves PIZZA, PASTA & Deserts you cannot get at other Mickey D plus an awesome playplace for kids (separate toddler area)
Arcade inside has quite a few machines - game cards c",1
If you퐎e ever visiting Orlando why not go to the biggest McDonald in the world. It is definitely really fun. The pastas and pizzas were surprising,1
"Very busy, but It's nice and different types of food. From cakes to pasta and even pizza. Had the pizza and chicken alfredo they were surprisingly good and easy to go down. Doesn't compare to a good restaurant. But if your craving pizza or pasta can't go wrong",1
"This is obviously the coolest mcdonalds I've been to. An arcade, little bakery, pizza, pasta and a cheesesteak!? Plus all the mcdonalds food you know of. I'm not giving it 5 stars because after waiting over 20 minutes and seeing others get their food and not have gotten my order yet, I had to go up to the counter and ask for it. But, the cashier was nice, gave me some extra nuggets for the wait and all was forgiven.

I recomend checking this mcdonalds out at least once in your life. Its definetly not like the one you are used to. Plus, open 24/7.",1
One of the best maccys I've seen. We don't get them the same scale here in the UK.  However during our visit on the middle floor there was female  drug addict camped out in the disabled restroom. Who went into the ladies restroom and blocked a member of our party from leaving and asked her for money. Fortuntely another member of the public went in and out party member returned.   Other than that. Really liked the place,1
The world's biggest McDonald's doesn't disappoint. My son was so excited to see they had Wood fired Pizza,1
"The McDonald's pizza is surprisingly good! This particular restaurant is gigantic and well staffed, meaning there is always plenty of seating and service is quick and accurate. This is a fun stop when in Orlando, especially if you are heading east after visiting the Diz.",1
Was very busy. But food was great and made quickly. We didn get a chance to go up stairs because of the crowd but the kids enjoyed the fish tank,1
Fun place! Biggest MCD's in the country. Service is fast and friendly. Love the extra food selections! Kids really enjoy the arcade upstairs as well.,1
Great experience I got my pizza fast and overall it was great the pizza was well made.,1
"Ok, it's complicated. Its always crowded because of its location but this McDonald's is just unique!! I believe the biggest and if you enjoy McDonald's you are going to love this one. And the pizza and pasta, ""yes you read correct"" is delicious. Its like there own recipes and they got it right !!!",1
"The pasta was incredible! It was a fair price and the flavor was on par with other more expensive pasta resturants. Overall great experience, the service was good and the restaurant looked clean. No complaints.",1
Has to be the best McDonald I have been in. They say the World biggest Mcd,1
"This is the biggest McDonald's in the world, has an upstairs with arcades and child's play area.

Menu is extensive, with pasta, pizza, omelettes and all day breakfasts!

If you visit Orlando and like a cheeky McDonald's, be sure to visit here!",1
"Nice organization, overall clean enough. The food took a while to come and my order needed a lot more salt than it had.
The arcade area was fun! You can pay 5 dollars to have unlimited credits for 30 minutes, not so bad (you can't earn prize tickets with this unlimited mode though).",1
"Very clear local, kindly staff and I loved the pizza",1
I visited this McDonald's only for the fame it has. What makes it special is the new menu items pizza and spaghetti. Also the arcade and the top floor is very nice. My food didn't take long and the restaurant was very busy specially on Thanksgiving holiday. 8/10,1
"Same mc McDonald's new experience. They offer foods not on the menu at other McDonald's, such as fruity pancakes and pizza. The best part, however, is being able to order breakfast items all day. It also features a second story with playplace and odd singing moon character that plays piano. Parking, however, is hard to find even at the best of times.",1
Fun tourist feel. Kids will go crazy. Nice small arcade. Please ask the crew for help in cashing in winnings they don't have a separate team working the arcade.,1
Food was great and they even served pizza and pasta. Multiple stories with playground and arcade games,1
"Best McDonald's I've ever been to. Good quality food, especially for a fast food restaraunt. This McDonald's also had a very fun-looking game room.",1
"You don't see a McDonald's with two-story anywhere until you come to Orlando, Florida. Just because of the size, I forced my family for us to eat here. They had a whole arcade area, pizza line etc. You have to check it out when you visit Orlando.",1
They forgot to give me cup for my coffee after waiting half hour. And when I went to ask for refund. They gave refund without any hassle and also offered free Apple pie for the inconvenience. And they still gave me cup for coffee. Staff are friendly. Huge play area for kids.,1
"Wow this McDonald's is different. First of all there's 2 floors. The first floor is essential just for dining and ordering. It is very different than a normal McDonald's however. Then on the second floor, which you can access via stairs or elevator, features a full fledged arcade and children's play area alongside some more eating areas. This McDonald's is a tourist attraction in and of itself. For sure worth a visit, even if you just go to see it because it's pretty cool. They also happen to serve McDonald's Pizza and Pasta too.",1
Best McDonald's menu and play ground area I ever seen in my life .,1
"We've been here multiple times and always thru the drive thru. Today, we actually ate inside for lunch. Today, the food was pretty good. Previously, it was ok to good, occasional messed up orders. Regardless,  we will continue to come back.",1
"Gas station McDonald's, adjoining but separate from the station's Timewise convenience store. (Bathrooms in-between, which were clean and multi-stalled.) Staff appeared to all be wearing masks, which is appreciable given their position of making food for and interacting with such a confluence of travelers from far-flung corners as they must. Food quality was on the high-side of McDonald's very small margin of differentiation. Only hic-up is that the space is not built for intimate conversations, and since they don't yell at you over the ambient hustle and bustle, I had some difficulty hearing the teller taking our order, as well as (though at a near table) did not hear our order number called -- hence I took off a star for ""ambiance"" in my rating here.",1
"This was actually the fastest McDonald's I've ever been in for the drive-thru. I ordered on the app, go to the pay window, waited about a minute and a half, got my drink then my food and I'm finally I was on my way. I wish other McDonald's were just as fast.",1
"Good McDonald's usually connect to a Travelwise gas station but due to covid it's no longer connected. Additionally, there is no dining in. You can only get food through the drive-thru. My drive-thru order is always correct. I usually have a special order of no pickles and it's always correct.",1
"I went through the drive-through at this Mc Donalds and had no issue with ordering. However, it did take unusually longer to go through the Drive Thru.

To that end, the food was hot and fresh. However, they did overstuff the bags with my order. As when I got one of the bags ripped and my food fell on the floor.

Lastly, if you go to this McDonalds be sure to double check if the bag is overfilled and ask for an additional bag if you need it. Besides that, everything else was fine.",1
"I love coming to this Mcdonald (LEON SPRINGS, TX ! Everyone is very welcoming ! The service here is great! No matt",1
"I always use the app here, but these guys are the best. I hardly ever wait and the food is al ways hot and made right.",1

"Consistent and great customer service for over a year now. Had to update my review as I order food here regularly. I know this isn't a fancy wine and dine but I never have a bad experience regardless if using the mobile app, or drive thru, or the occasional walk in I do. The manager and great team are to thank for this. Always polite, timely, and much more than you get at any other McDonald's.",1
Management is so kind here at this one. They are very efficient at this busy busy location .,1
One of the slower McDonald but attached to the gas station for convenienc,1
The line can be a little slow but they get everything right so it,1
Friendliest McDonalds staff I have ever met. Love the old school setup. Great pitstop during long drives.,1
Longtime customer. This afternoon I was pleased to see the dining room open again with limited hours.  I would like to point out that this particular crew and manager tonight provided most excellent service. And the manager was great at keeping employees motivated which I don't often see elsewhere. And the food was excellent. Fries were just right and the Mc Rib was great. Quite frankly this may have been my best McDonald's experience ever! Keep up the good work!,1
"It's McDonald's not a Michelin Star restaurant. Service wasn't the best, then again it was 11pm on a Saturday. Fries were lukewarm, McFlurry was watery, and the cashier needed an attitude adjustment. But if you're in need of a late night snack after a night out look no further!",1
Long line but moved quickly what else can I say it's Mcdonalds!,1
Good hash brown,1
This McDonald's is always in the same place and it's as good as any McDonald's ever.,1
"This is honestly my favorite McDonald's, my food is always fresh, the staff is always nice and I even get lucky and find a free cookie in the bag from time to time!",1
Store stays pretty clean and food is made fresh.,1
"Generally fast service, accurate orders.   This particular McDonald's is attached with a gas station and is often pretty busy but the line does tend to move quickly.   I do often check my order to ensure I receive my order accurately - for example I get the ketchup or dipping sauce I asked/ordered with my meal -and generally the orders are accurate.  The lines may take a bit more time but again this particular location is at a busy intersection and the next close McDonald's is going to be in Boerne.",1
"They have started to give a full slice of cheese when you order one on Filet-O-Fish sandwiches, and that was a real problem before in which they used to give half of a slice extra. This is a fast location and food is consistently fresh, so now this location has the highest rating I've given a fast food chain yet to date. Kind of never thought I'd give McDs a 4 star, but I did.",1
"Food was good ... price point for fast food is too high. For two people $23 +. For quality and size of fast food meal, I should have gone to cracker barrel.",1
"I just want to applaud the team that worked this (closing) shift, everyone working really hard and I loved how kind the cashier was. It was my first time dining in and would re",1
This location traditionally has fresher tasting food than other locations however they forget sauce for the nuggets pretty frequently.,1
Awesome food awesome recipe awesome workers great head manager great cleaning services great breakfast great pancakes we love Mcdonalds awesome place!,1
Clean and fast. Good food good service,1
"Good food. Pretty fast considering lunch rush. I would give 5 stars had the manager not been to rude to myself, other customers and employees, not to mention his inability to pay attention to orders. Perhaps he forgot that drinks are not in the lobby with the current health risks even though he had no problem shoving the lids and straws at me.",1
"I am currently sitting in the drive-thru at this McDonalds and although it taking forever, Ince you get to the first window, the customer service is awesome!!!! They have a lot of new faces, but the same friendly service. I met Chris, manager, for the first time and he is awesome! Issac brought my food out, because I had to wait in a reserve spot, and he was so ni",1
Carmel Frappe should have it own line,1
It's a McDonald's. They at least have some trailer parking.,1
"I was so upset as we got the wrong order for my granddaughter..well I called and spoke to a manager Audicle... unbelievable amazing customer service...she understood my frustrations, she went above and beyond to make sure the meal was correct & hot.. I will undoubtedly be a return customer there regardless of the line ...with managers like that the store must run well with happy employees as well... Great job !!!",1
"Love McDonald's fries..... but inside lobby is closed  
Update 8/3022: they are super busy and und",1
"This location was closed to dine in service so we did not end up eating here. Though I've got to say that it's surprising to see a large fast food chain closing stores where they might lose business. It's almost like they value their employees. Well done, mcdonalds.",1
"I always get mobile curbside pick up and usually they take less than 10 minutes for the order, even if there's a long line in the drive thru.",1
"They had a pretty long line for the drive-through when I was there, but they got through everyone pretty quickly.",1
"Stopped off at 8pm on Tue. 06-08-21.  Went thru the drive thru, all smooth no issues quick fast food, nice and hot. That You for taking time to read this review, follow my reviews on Google and Please give me a thumbs up.",1
"Night shift was slacking one night I went by, but the manager quickly resolved by getting more employees on the shift and the results were great! Speedy service and good taste as usual.  This is my favorite McDonald's to go to",1
"Slowest McDonald's around, But the games and modern layout make it easy to pass the time. Particularly like the touch screen head to head games... Play them with my daughter and we have a blast.  Food delivered to the table for those eating in the restaurant. Bathrooms are clean and there is easy access on and off the 35 for those traveling through and needing to grab a quick bite to eat.",1
"We had the hottest quarter pounder we have ever had! This Mcdinalds Ricks.
The drive thru was fast and we even got enough napkins!!!
Great job...keep it up.
Ill go to this Mcdonalds any day!!!!!",1
Clean spot personally everyone is clean the food is clean and fresh the quarter pounder is always fresh. Had a deluxe crispy chicken with mayo and bacon,1
Best pancakes ever and the service was nice and quick,1
Super great fries.  Hot and fresh.  Scarfed those babies up in no time.,1
"Always reliable and consistent flavors.
Great location. Great service.
Options for everyone.
Not open yet, but curb side pick up and drive through available.",1
"I went through the drive-thru; service was fast and efficient,  just as I expected it to be. The staff was courteous and even provided me with extra napkins when I asked for them. The food was hot and good. What more could one want?",1
"I'm normally not a McDonald's customer,but, today I tried their crispy chicken sandwich and it was very good. Fast, friendly service as well( one of McDonald's trademarks)",1
"Little slow getting order out but it was nice, hot and fresh!",1
McDonald's is always a treat. If in a big hurry I get a double cheeseburger with a large Dr. Pepper.  Or on hot South Texas days a vanilla ice cream cone hits the spot. Yum!!!,1
"My daughter and I love the quality of service that we receive here, and the great tasting food. My family and I are truly thankful.",1
Just too much in a little bitty area need bigger lines and some type of space I get in side a convince store but it's still alright,1
My kid's happy meal didn't get a drink nor toy.,1
Love how friendly and quick they are.,1
Working in the field with vehicles that fit the drive thru the manger was kind enough to help me out. not to many restaurants in the area plz be in charge real cant get away from the job site. Thank you sir. really apriciate it. Was starving.,1
The McRib sandwich was great and what a deal 2 for $6.  Of course a Mc Donalds stop is not complete without fries.  Got a small order watching my carb intake but should have gotten a medium or large.  Love the fries!,1
"This is a very busy McDonald's attached to a gas station at a very busy intersection. The guy at the register had a very strong accent and was difficult to understand at times....nice, but hard to understand. We were fortunate to sit next to the same guy we just saw panhandling at the intersection.",1
Yep...a gas station Mc Donald's. Lobby is currently closed (9/19/2020). Good place to stop and empty the family and fill the car on your way west of San Antonio.,1

"My favorite thing that I have been getting from McDonalds is the chicken biscuit meal and I add folded egg and cheese that comes with a hashbrowns and a drink which is always half sweet and half unsweet. And it is the best I highly recommend it if you want a hearty meal with meat and ""breakfast"" food. So I highly recommend it.",1
"Fresh, hot breakfast and friendly service. Great visit.",1
Food is fresh and the service is always in a timely manner. I work in the oilfield so most of the time I have to get food on the go. McDonald's in Pecos will always have my business.,1
Ordering and recieving was fast and to the point. Doesn't always play out that way but this time at this location it went perfect. No long wait and order was correct. Thanks,1
"The line was very long yet took maybe 5 minutes to get through.  Food was fresh, hot & made to order.",1
Friendly and clean!  And you have to try the new quarter pounder if you havent already!  I used to always get the chicken sandwich because i didnt care for the burgers until i saw the new quarter pounder sign!,1
"I went there to dine in and use their free hotspot to look for jobs.The dine in is closed. I went thru their drive thru...the understood my order, gave it to me promptly and wore goles and facemakes during whole process.",1
This is one of the fastest McDonald's in the area despite having only 1 drive through lane. Highly recommend,1
"Order correct, coupon worked, courtesy and thoughtfulness! Convenient to my grandkids house. Yes! Did NOT eat in the car!",1
Great place great service great restaurant great food great cleaning services great employees great managers keep up the good work team,1

Food was delicious.",1
"The manager, a young lady, was really nice and fast. The food was freshly made.",1
Yes I had been drinking and rolled up in an uber at 4 am. I'm a bartender and eat thing like Whataburger a lot.  It was the freshest fast food I have had in years,1
Everything we ordered was fresh service was good and atmosphere was comfortable.,1
Usually pretty good occasionally they get backed up but all in all a solid location,1
"Fast, friendly, efficient.",1
Order was correct. I guess I will have to get used to eating in my car. Drive thru line went quickly.,1
"Quick Service and great location, I always stop there for my apple pie treat to myself! And it's great when dipped into a cup of ice cream!",1
"Line was a little long, but went fast. Order was correct, food was hot. Not much more to ask for",1
This location is one of the best McDonald's I've eaten at. I worked there a long time ago and it's good to know it's still being run well enough.,1
"Fast, friendly and my go to place for frozen treats! Yummy! The peach slushie is my new favorite.",1
When using the app you can get some really good deals.,1
It's McDonald's. Service was fast and friendly. Can't give it 5 stars because it's McDonald's and unless staff is rude or the place is dirty it's hard to mess up McDonald's,1
Good McDonald's. Usually get the orders right. Bigger orders just need to check they don't forget anything and of they did they fix it right away.,1
Fries were fresh and adequately salted. Friendly customer service.,1
Staff is very friendly.,1
"Ordered the homestyle chicken sandwich, fries and a strawberry banana shake. It was hot and fresh and good for McDonald's.",1

"The employees here are very commendable, very fast, attentive and very nice as always! So far this is the fastest serving McDonalds drive thru i have experienced. Courteous employees and going extra mile to deliver your orders, saying sorry when took some time. Service was quick, atmosphere was good, and looks like the employees were trained good and happy in their place. I have been coming to this McDonalds for about a year. I have always had great service and happy interactions with the employees. Hot and fresh Quarter pound burgers are delicious along with their great fries and drinks.",1
Super busy. But the food is always and Mickeydees good!!!,1

I so,1
Excellent food with excellent service!,1
"Fast service ,  some time  hot food 占쏙",1
They can be very slow when you go inside to order but the they focus more on the drive thru then the people inside! But overall it's okay and maybe it depends on the day that you come..,1
Shoe store was nice and clean all the shoes are in place customer service was terrific the problem that I have is that it does not go up to size 12 and dress shoes for women,1
The kids love them,1
"Use the app for deals. This location is clean, and orderly. Service is polite and orders are accurate. What more would you ask for? A happy meal? They have those too.",1
Great food and service,1
"Long lines but that's McDonald's for you, when they are selling crack I mean two all beef patties with special sauce on a sesame seed bun. The problems lies when you have a big order at the drive through. You must hold the line to make sure you got everything you ordered because you dont want to have to go inside or go through the drive through again. Quite a dilemma.",1
Ordered my food. Just your typical McDonald's.  The special orders were all correct. Slight wait and the manager gave me two free holiday pie desserts for the hassle. Excellent customer recovery and service.,1
I so missed this place since it was not serving breakfast during the early onset of the COVID-19 Virus.  Could not wait to grab me two sausage biscuit sandwiches yesterday when I stopped in and due to not having one since March 2020.  Still great sandwich and fast place to eat for a quick bite.,1
Slow on service(Drive Thru) but excellent food/ drink service,1
"This particular McDonald's is about the best I've ever been to. I normally go through the drive-thru at 5:30 in the morning, along with numerous of other cars, and there's never a long wait. I'm normally in and out the Drive-Thru,  ( With my food and beverage ) in about 10 to 15 minutes tops!! My coffee, cheese, biscuit, egg and steak seemingly, is always waiting for me good, and hot every morning. In-fact everything that, I've ever purchase from here, has always been good. ""Oh! And I must say that the employees even at, 4:30 in the morning, are always pleasant, polite,, and friendly. And that really helps me, jump start my day!
""Thank you McDonald's I'm loving it""",1
"I am a sweet tea addict, so I see these employees daily. Many of them greet me by name, most of them know my order, and they are all excellent employees. I appreciate them every day!",1
"Long line at the drive through, but it moved super fast.  Very friendly staff. My order was correct and the food was hot.",1
"Completely serviceable. Not the best, but not the worst location by far. Could use with a few sectors hands keeping the tables clean. But food is hot and fast!",1
McDonald team work fast and efficient very few McDonalds have short line they get the job done Thank you Mary P,1
"Staff was friendly and order was correct. You guys made my nieces very happy, kids are crazy when they are 'hangry'.",1
I'm only giving them 4 starts because the corporation sucks! But I've always had great experience with the employees!,1
"It's McDonald's...literally no more, and not one iota less. We all need a reliably bland, calorie-rich meal from time to time.           Ronald Mac - I salute you.",1
I enjoy going to that McDonald's because it is always well kept up in my opinion.. The staff is very nice... The surrounding is comfortable and even the customers are even pleasant.. If you are older and want to go for a nice friendly hang out in the morn that is the place to meet new friends.. IN MY OPINION...,1
Food was good.  Check your fries prior to leaving.  Mine were cold.,1
Love my restaurant,1
This is my spot on the regular.  Tonight they shorted me three orders of fries and sometimes the sweet tea is too sweet.,1
Papa papa I'm loving it,1
My Best experience is me walking in and seeing the staff smiling face waiting to take your order. Saying GOOD MORNING beautiful may I help you,1
"The place is clean, they mostly get your order right. Serve us fast. But it can be really crowded.",1
Good!,1
I've loved this place since I was a child. I miss the play place. They need to make them everywhere as a requirement. I am glad they brought the happy meal boxes back :),1
"They can handle a custom order, but the wait time is usally longer than it should be at this location.",1
Drive thru lone is always long but they are efficient in getting everyone in and out,1
Don't have to wait for a long time the walk up line was fast and my order was right the first time.,1
Why hide them less than 5 . You've been in my life forever. Great place. Great management.,1
Cause it's a nice place to take your kid's and sit down and hold a commersation and let them talk and the food is good to all of us,1
"Friendly customer service through drive thru service was great. Friendly, pleasant staff, offering fast service as well.",1
Very friendly workers and they move pretty quickly too. Clean inside & outside. Lighting outside is good at night as well.,1
"I love this place.  I go here often.  They have booths.  Even though u r in the public, u have privacy.  The staff are courteous and quick!",1
"Most have no idea the historic significance of this McDonalds.  Back in the 60's ALL McDonalds restaurants were drive-ins....meaning no indoor seating.  You ate in your car (or standing outside).  Oak Park had an ordinance that stated ""no drive-in restaurants"" but Ray Kroc (founder of McDonalds wanted a McDonalds in his home town).  So in order to get approval to be built, THIS very McDonalds,  agreed to install stand up (hi-top) tables inside so technically you could eat inside.  It was to my knowledge the first McDonalds ever where you could sit inside and eat.  As I recall, it opened in/around 1966 or so.  It was a VERY big deal around the area.",1
It a nice and clean place their in oak park McDonald's. I lived their for over 15 years and never had any problems,1
The sandwich was terrible. The meat wasn't cook all the way,1
I love McDonald's forever and a day the main ones is on central and roosevelt and central also the one in oak park around my area,1
It was good. They had the lunch menu's up. But not serving lunch yet. So needs to not put that up unless they are serving lunch,1

"This is the best McDonald's I have been to in a long time!   I have 1 across the street from my apartment and I wish I could swap them out.  Service at THIS McDonald's is excellent and everyone that I interacted with was friendly and helpful.  The food actually looked like the advertising and tasted good.  I was so impressed that I asked for the manager so I could thank him and compliment his crew.  I truly believe that managers affect everything about their restaurant,  for  good or bad. Happy, respected employees who feel properly valued always reflect that in their interactions with customers and you could see that this manager was a leader of a team and not just the boss! Great McDonald's experience!",1
"I would usually not rave about McDonald's as we eat there multiple times a week, but the service at this location was head and shoulders above the norm. Elizabeth, the floor supervisor, was amazing. She customized our burgers and figure out the best combos to feed the family. She made sure we had everything we needed and introduced us to strawberry pie.  Highly recommend this location.",1
"UPDATE 2021: This is a solid restaurant. My food has always been made to McDonald's standards. They have very busy times, which is in part due to their location on the highway in a restaurant area, but also because they are a solid restaurant. Their curbside service gives you an estimate of your wait, which is appreciated, and your food will be delivered by a friendly employee (an improvement from my previous experience). My only complaint is that it's obvious they make your curbside drink far earlier than your delivery, because they come to you partially melted (see the slush below).

2019:
They identified my ",1
"This store has a lot of younger people working it. But they do a really great job, and are always polite!",1
"We wanted to dine-in. Nope.

Drive in line was huge and took a long time.

First order of fries was cold, even with the crazy long line. Didn't make any sense to me.

They fixed the fry issue IMMEDIATELY and with kindness.

Here's the deal: the staff there HAD TO BE OVERWHELMED.

They better be making $25 an hour at least.",1
After being disappointed with my experience with Dave and busters we stopped by this McDonald. The line was a little long but I did no mind. It was worth the wait. They were very courteous and the food has always been ,1
"I can't quit you!  LOL  Unlike other Mc D's these guys actually check your order and make sure you have a straw.  Because that REALLY matters, especially when you are on the road. Always pleasant and accurate, and FAST service here.  I love these guys.",1
Pretty modern and clean McDonald's location with a nice outdoor seating area (when the weather is cooler). Workers are friendly enough and the food came out quick and as expected.,1
"This was a mostly great experience. The drive thru is a bit slow but the food was fresh, hot and delicious! No reason to have 2 speaker lines when the pay and pickup windows are slow.",1
One of the better ones around with nice employees,1
"The lobby just opened up after having been remodeled for the past few months and it's so clean! Everything is looking and smelling great. The staff have gotten more accurate and faster. Highly recommend.
Edit: I forgot to mention they have those kiosks to order yourself which severely reduces waiting time. An employee was even willing to show me how to use the darn thing. I refused, of course.
Edit 2, 5/29/2019: Being the lover of caramel that I am, it should come as no surprise that I'm in love with the new-to-America stroopwafel McFlurry. Highly recommend giving that a try!",1
"I went through the drive through Friday Dec 23, 2016 at about 7:20 a.m. There was a young black female working the window where you pay, and I have to say she set the tone for my day. What a sweetheart, she was all smiles and just a joy for my first stranger encounter of the day. With the way things have been going in this country the last several months, she was a bright spot in an otherwise dreary daily grind, and I will not soon forget how she lifted my spirits all over a sausage burrito and a cup of coffee. She set the bar, good job.",1
"Drivethru was atleast 20 vehicles, went a lot faster than I thought. Was a disappointing to find out that they dont sell salads anymore at 290 and springdale area location.",1
"Online order, food wasn't fresh other than that I was ok with the food",1
It was a busy Sunday t,1
"They have a great deal on drinks and since I don't eat meat, the main reason I ever drive through is to get a drink and sometimes, an ice cream cone. This time, the ice cream machine was broken. It seems to happen with some frequency. I guess they serve lots of shakes and ice cream.",1
"It was great I had a birthday party there for a sibling. The staff was really nice, they gave us some extra happy meals because they messed up our cake we are the great time we had cookies and had a bunch of fun I'd recommend coming here it was nice",1
"The last person just said this place is outdated and mentioned that there are iPads on the tabe... For some reason that doesn't make sense to me. I just went there and ordered some food. The manager who took my order joked around with me making me laugh. That's always a plus. After I payed I decided that I wanted an ice cream cone. The manager dude that took my order just gave me the ice cream cone on the house! The food I ordered was delicious too. Thanks yall, I'll be back for sure now.",1
The food is alright but the don add all your when you order so yeah I had to ,1
Great female staff one of the older women gave me great service.,1
The cashier with a unique name. she was awesome. Some of the nicest people I've ever met working at a McDonald's.  Definitely will make it my usual McDonald spots.,1
"Its McDonald's,  not sure what to expect. Take about the same when I get a crazing for soy burgers. I want to try that experiment my self where you set out food from there and see if it denigrating or stays looking the same. I'll find out one day...",1
"Whenever we are near here late at night and want junk food we stop here, but both times they have forgotten one of our fries. It's annoying, but not enough to turn around for.",1
"Service v good, employees at the griddle wear gloves, employees are neat,
Restroom needs to be more clean.
Clorox solution for cleaning have to go.
Slippery floor with that nasty clorox.",1
Quick service as usual.,1
I was picking up UberEats from this store today...great team! They were fast and friendly. Thank you!,1
Playground outside ! and big dining area,1
Fries were kind of cold and a little under cooked. Everything else was bomb.,1
"I love this restaurant. This is one of my favorite places ever to grab some food. The service is high quality, kind employees and really fast. I love it.",1
"Great food, go by in the afternoon or evening though, the morning shift dislikes the manager and it shows. She's a good manager, the people seem to not like their job or..... something.",1
Busy but prompt. Parked and give give me jelly or ketchup. But everything else was good.,1
Theyve changed management and the crew that works there now is super friendly and the restaurant cleanliness has improved drastically. I only give it 5 stars because it is McDonald's.,1
Austin best McDonald,1
Love the fries and drinks,1
The food was fresh. There are two employees that are rude Everytime. Maybe they are in the wrong field of employment,1
This time the door was unlocked to the facility so that I could use it after paying for my purchase.,1
Great service,1
Sidel had excellent customer service in drive thru. I was not expecting this at 7am at a McDonald's. Glad I stopped by.,1
Fast and clean! Just like a fastfood machine!,1
"Honestly, I feel so appreciated in this establishment. They gave me grape jelly when no else did, if I could rate this place 10/10 I would.",1
Great customer service and always have your food made fresh when you order,1
This chain should figure out it's drive-thru method it's so third world country old-fashioned they need to turn on the brain power and figure it out.,1
Stopped in at the spare  of the moment to get 4 dozen chocolate chip cookies  and they were fresh and fast with my order! Thanks!,1
The good taste is reel. Worth the try and the money too,1
Really like the self service ordering kiosk. The restaurant is nicely remodeled.,1
God bless the golden arches. Now if they'd get gluten free buns we'd be set set the rapture,1

"Very clean, and nice staff! A bonus: One of the people helping me with my order was from Michigan too!! GO GREEN!! And the manager was very helpful. The security guard had hit wits about him.",1
I always stop in to McDonald's to get a nice ice coffee with 2 pumps of sugar free vanilla. You can't go ,1
As always great costumer service and excellent food quality. After paying close attention to the conveyor belt I see the food is made above the restaurant. I think that's pretty awesome. Great costumer service as always. The ladies working behind the counter are definitely doing a great job.,1
I stated at a near by hotel. This was the only thing around open late. Only the drive thru was open. The drive thru took 30 min. When it was my turn to order the cashier skip my lane and helped 3 car from the other lane first.,1
"There's nothing special about a big Mac. I'm not sure about this location, but I've definitely paid $18 for a big mac meal. Better at better prices elsewhere.",1
"This is one of the busiest McDonald I퐒e seen. On the rare occasions when I come here for a coffee and hashbrown in the morning, this place is always packed full of hungry, antsy customers. The staff are incredibly patient and hardworking. McDonald customers (myself included) are probably the most annoying customers in the restaurant industry, but",1
The fries were hot but barely had salt on it. I couldn't taste any flavor,1
The girl taking our order was so incredibly nice! She was helpful and cheerful and really got our day off to a great start! The food was great and and it was done quickly!,1
"I퐉 glad to see this location is finally open again. Everything in the drive thru was fast, smooth, and consistent with what I expect from a McDonald",1
What a awesome staff that works here ALWAYS smiles and willing to take your order and get it right. Ketsia is just a sweetheart and very attentive to anything that is needed customer service is out of this world.Conrad is wonderful and he has a pleasure to talk to always.,1
The guys in the drive thru were so nice!  Love the deals too! BOGO!,1
Food is always fresh. My son loves when we head over after school for a little lunch.,1
"In contrast to the many radical reviews, this location was slick, modern, new, & clean. Small downstairs because the kitchen is upstairs. At 4:00 p.m. there were about 3 to 4 times more cars lined up to get to the drive-thru than there were people inside. My food was fine nothing too positive or negative.
This IS a McDonald's- not your family BBQ.",1
"This is one of the best McDonalds I have been to. They were closed for several months due to construction. The great food and service has made up for the time when they were not operational. The food is always hot and the Buns so far have been fresh and soft. The best thing about McDonald's are the FRIES!!!!  Their fries are always fresh, hot, and delicious. The best part is they stand straight up in the box just as they do on the commercials and pictures. I don't mind waiting in the sometimes long drive-thru line for fresh food. Thank you for having pride in the food you serve.",1
"It's a newly renovated McDonald's, has a very skinny drive thru, so be cautious. It's advertised as 24 hours, but isn't always open 24. Have gotten food here several times since reopening. Every time food has been hot and tasted fresh. Customer service was surprisingly good. Will up date in the future. Trying to eat healthier...you should as well. Fa$t food $hould never be a daily thing. Warning ",1
"Had to order at the kiosk. Good was fast and freshly made, great for a quick meal on the go. The interior of the place was very sterile. No menus above the counter. This location was just remodeled too, not liking it at all.",1
I can always close my eyes and count on the flavor being the same decade after decade,1
Nice place very friendly. Needs to be a little more quicker. Its very small despite the tall building it was not busy either so the service shouldn't have taken so long,1
Great food and service! Cleanest most organized McDonalds I have ever been in!!,1
"The rest room was clean, I was craving French fries plus chicken nuggets and I got them, they were nice and crisp",1
"Best customer service we've ever had at a McDonald's and close to, if not the best, service we've had at any restaurant period. Clean, well managed, and unexpectedly a very nice experience with our family of 5 little kids. Thanks for exceptional service!",1
"The counter girl was very friendly and helpful! I want to use my app and the girl helped me out. I did have to wait almost 10 minutes to get someone to take my order.
Thank you!",1
"A bit of a long line in the drive thru, but the workers where moving the lines along. They friendly at the windows.",1
"My friend and I ate here together, and we both deem this to be the best McDonald's that we have ever been to. Twice the manager came around to us to make sure that everything was going well. That's a first for me at a McDonald's.",1
I had a #BigMacAttack glad the sandwich was nearby this hour.,1
"Hot fries and standard fare. Can get very, very busy in weekend nights at the drive through.",1
"Clean premises. Professional service. Delicious food. When it's less busy, they'll come up to your table to check on your experience.",1
I want to return to this McDonald's some day when the pandemic ends. The lobby looks cozy to dine in.,1
First time back since it was remodeled. The girl in the drive thru was great. Very friendly and personable.,1
24 hrs. Isn't that enough? Hot coffee? Comfort food.,1
"Super clean, super neat, new self service is great, my son loves it, search deals!!! Take advantage of them!!!",1
"Good coffee, excellent food, nice people.",1
"2 lanes, moves super fast.",1
Newly renovated. Not a McDonald eater. Had some free time so I decided to have a cup of coffee with pie. Loved it.,1
"Good location. I went in as the drive thru line was a little long, must be a busy area. I got my food quick, I only had to wait a couple of minutes, I was not even able to fill up my drink cup before my food was done. The staff was quick and friendly.",1
"Great service! Food is hot and fresh!
Im loving it! ",1
It was clean. It was not too crowded. The items I ordered were up fast. It's a place to go when you don't have a lot of dough and not a lot of time. I try to eat healthy but sometimes you just need something fast.,1
"First time to this location, came at night (between 10pm and midnight) and was pleasantly surprised how fresh everything was and made to order, the fries were fantastic and my GF loved the Oreo McFlurry.

Will be back when I get my next craving!",1
"Decent McDonald's, newly rebuilt, quick drive through.  Sometimes food's been under heatlamp a bit long though.",1
"I only eat McDonald's once or twice a year, and after 22 years in the neighborhood this location is - in my experience - the best of the chain within a mile of the length of Ventura Blvd.  Fries have always been fresh.  Service has always been efficient.  Don't let long lines scare you.",1
This McDonald's is fast and very easy to get in and out of.,1
This is one of the best McDonald's. Place is clean and it gets quite a bit of traffic. Parking is tight but the drive thru(24 hrs) is short. The staff is mostly young professionals and they represent themselves well. Great fast food.,1
Little bit of a wait but that's pretty much everything in LA chicken came out hot and they remembered the sauces. The location didn't look too shabby but if they had a larger parking lot they could probably not contribute to the traffic on the street.  It's McDonald's not a chic-fil-a  you get what you pay for,1
Nice clean location. Customer service was super friendly and professional. Nice seating available. Outside seating also available. This location has 24 hr drive through. Overall great experience. Keep up the good work!,1
"Carlos, the young man running the front, was so friendly and all smiles even though he was getting overran and I myself was a bit of a problem for him as I had 5 kids who ordered 10 minutes apart from each other and changed their order twice. He still managed to take it all in stride and got us our food in a reasonable amount of time and with a smile on his face!",1
"A little small for my taste. It is one of the older McDonalds, so it doesn't have outlets.
The staff is great, though! There is one dude that works in the morning that is always so nice, and it seems like he never has a bad day! None of the staff (as far as I have seen) discriminate against homeless people. Their humanity gets them the extra star!",1
"Beware of the parking, it is very crowded and the drive through is inconveniently located  very closely to row of cars backing up and when gets crowded, if you are backing up you may have to wait or  even worse get hit by a car backing up (I actually saw this).  Not a big fan of McDonalds food, but the fries are classic and a tea no sugar is refreshing.  My order is always small fries and large tea no sugar.  Service is always great.",1
This place has clean restroom. The parking is free but is mostly full and requires some wait to park. The dining area is not so big but clean. The cashier was friendly and welcoming. I like that breakfast was served all day.,1
"As always, McDonald's prices are good for your pocketbook. Bought it for my three little friends and they were very full. And my wallet was very happy. Very friendly employees as well.",1
"Although it took longer than I expected to dine on, there was actually service and concern from the attentive  staff. And I really like the burgers. I get a qtr pounder with cheese and dont eat the  bottom bun.  To cut carbs. If you do it quickly the cheese doesn't melt so it very easy to go openfaced!",1
It's a McDonald's like any other.,1
I am so happy and glad that they finally reopen. And a new remodel is amazing really nice.,1
"Great, friendly, efficient service for a quick bite in the car. The fast food was served piping hot and the sauce to meat ratio was on target...French fries were seasoned perfectly with just the right amount of crunch.",1
Cool new McD's with the kitchen on the Top floor.  Needs sum better decor very plain,1
"Got the spicy nuggets, everything was great! HUGE shoutout to Michael on staff, legendary experience with him!!",1
It's McDonald's but not too bad considering they just completely remodeled the place. The kitchen is now upstairs and it has smaller foot print with a bigger more organized parking area.,1
"As far as McDonalds go, this is a pretty good one. Know how I can tell? Fries are *always* blistering hot.  I live near this McDonald's and I don't have to force myself to come here even though I pick up food 2 or 3 times per month. Stuff that's supposed to be hot is hot; stuff that is supposed to be cold is cold. As far as the service goes, here's the amazing thing: mostly millennials are working here .... and the service is still good! If you are in the area and hungry, I recommend this McDonald's....but please don't tease the Millinials they get spooked easy and stampede.  Thanks.",1
It's a little bit hard to get in and out of the parking lot other than that everybody is very nice and it's a good facility they don't run as many specials or deals like by two or buy one get one free on the breakfast sandwiches and stuff like a lot of other McDonald's do so that's why I didn't give him five stars other than that the place is clean and they're good,1
"McDonald's is awesome, get the app with that you can get 99 cent large iced coffee!",1
Small but very busy McDonald's location with a drive thru.  They offer their standard menu and service is reasonably fast.  They do have extra attendants working the drive thru during busy hours to try and move traffic along.,1
I ate so many big mac. A  Lot. 4. I love mcdanal an big Mac plz,1
"The new design is futuristic. Self-order, no register, sleek design, compact. Impressive.",1
It's McDonalds. If you don't know to check your bags before you pull away then you've never been to a fast food restaurant before. The service was friendly and the new menu items are fun to try. Seriously though it doesn't deserve one Star reviewing... I've been to some true one Star places and this isn't one of them.,1
"This place has a small parking lot, but the inside is generally clean and cool. The soda machines Diet Dr Pepper tastes a little off, other than that the service is good and the food is well put together.",1
They know how you make early morning coffee taste yummy to the last drop.,1
I used to work across the street so I would go there quite often. Usually quick. On occasion I would wait 20 minutes to get my order. Otherwise good service.,1
"This McDonald's ice cream machine has never once been broken anytime I've ordered ice cream, and that's literally the most I could ask of any fast food establishment.",1
My fa our place for coffee. Always we make sure we get the senior coffee.,1
Super clean. Amazing customer service and the vibes here are really great. This location is in my top 3 favorite McDonald restaurants.,1
The guy taking our order for drive thru (he was standing outside taking orders) was really nice and helpful.,1
Service member that took my order was my lifesaver this morning. God bless you and your family plus staff members. #framily,1
"My burger was fresh cooked, perfect in every way. The fried were hot. Fast friendly service. Great mc donalds.",1
It was very busy for the time I came in. I had a 15 minute wait on my food,1
This location always seems to be on top of their game.  The drive thru line at rush hour goes quickly and the servers are friendly and efficient.  Love this McDonalds!,1
"I guess for a McDonald's, it deserves 5 stars because it was perfectly a normal McDonald's, but it is still the lowest common denominator when looking for food, so...

Don't expect ""more than McDonald's"", but it was clean and the food was hot.",1
Loved it ordered the new beacon extreame burgar without onions. Nice choice from Spain. The lobby is clean and neat and the service is quick.,1
Very good service my 1st time here ..me and my kids are in a vacation so we decided to eat here and the greetings and food quality really good i give it 5 stars .. Recommend to come here.,1
It's open 24 hours (the drive through at least) so you can get that item your craving for day or night! Good service & friendly staff!,1
Best McDonalds ive ever been to. Food was very fresh and well made. Service was timely considering the amount of customers that were waiting. Will definately be back!!,1
Hot and fresh in the throws of a lunch rush. Best Quarter Pounder i've had in a minute,1
"It was McDonald's!  The service was fast and friendly.  The food was good and most importantly the FRENCH FRIES were HOT!!
NOTHING WORST THAN COLD FRENCH FRIES! !",1
my country men was serve and assist my order.  thankz,1
"The usual McDonald's clean, very busy, parking is not great it is a very active drive thru. I was able to park but getting out was harder.",1
This is my go to McDonald and it,1
excellent place to dine fast service,1
"Love stopping through here before or after work! The restaurant is smaller many, but makes up for it in Customer service and accessibility.",1
Went through the drive through was good service and fast inside looks big and spacious in case you prefer to eat inside,1
Great Customer Service Friendly staff. Got My Order Done in A Timely manner. Thanks MCDonalds Staff.,1
Always quick and easy out of this location They managed to keep this place very clean,1
It's fast food right? But the service was friendlier than you'd normally associate with fast food and that was from interacting with three different,1
Always buy my ice coffee here usually it's perfect but a few times it taste really watery or over loaded on cream/milk or even vanilla flavor,1
"The standard McDonald's menu, the staff is friendly the restaurant is clean. They do get busy and sometimes they get a little behind but not a lot.",1
"The new rebuilt mcdonalds looks nice, also 2 drive thru lanes now.",1
It's not a great place but it's not too bad of a McDonald's to just go in & have a quick meal to eat there or take it with u,1
"Drive thru was fast with 3 point contact. Order taken in line, payment window then pick up window",1
Good service and got us everything quickly.,1
We always have fun at McDonald's,1
Nice customer service free Wi-Fi and they even have outside seats small parking lot though. Overall good experience.,1
Very friendly staff and quick service. One of the better McDonald's I've been to.,1
Good food.,1
Besides the guy with the meth pipe going through the trash the food is as expected. It's not McDonald's fualt there is a methademic,1
Friendly and fast. No issues,1
Quick service friendly staff food was yummm... and the two breakfast sandwhiches for $4 is awesome!,1
"I went today, 11:15am, asked for the free big Mac/maccoin, they said, they were not authorized, 08/02/2018",1
Made a quik stop during lunch hour rush and was in ans out of there fast with great sevice and freshly cooked fries and a bomb oreo shake.,1
"Fast service, friendly, bathroom wasn't available, over all thank you",1
Place is too small. Once you order I waited for my food and I really didn't have anyplace to stand without getting in someone's way.,1
Drive through is faster than walk in. Food is good for McD's.,1
Very good service and my food came out really quick good coffee and quality food,1
Very friendly fast counter personal..always willing to make sure your order is correct,1
I've never had a problem at this location. The best employees thus far,1
"The Place was okay, excepting the bathroom,  i know it's difficult have that clean and beauty but could be better conditions",1
The second story is a lie. There is only 1 floor.,1
"Open 24 hours in the dining room as well as the drive-thru. And WiFi, too! Thank you McDonald's!",1
They do an amazing job here in the mornings to get all us busy people in and out quickly!,1
"Ay listen here, this place gets 5 stars err day of the week. Tuesday to Monday. Real fries realfries real frys",1
"Great job at this location, from Orlando, Fla tourist.",1
McDonald's in North Hollywood very good customer service you got to deal with the homeless a lot right there though a good McDonald's to go to,1
Fast and efficient.,1
We got mcdonald's then we drove to San Diego and than I proposed to my wife at tuna park.,1
Small but friendly and clean.,1
I don't really eat food at Mcdonalds but I stopped in there frequently for their hazelnut iced coffee.,1
"McD's is always a good time, but this time was great! All thanks to the cool staff!",1
always cheerful and always helpful. great service. the only downside is OVER RUN BY HOMELESS PEOPLE all the time!,1
"Long drive thru line, very fast service. Impressive",1
This is my favorite place fair prices good food and the best crew,1
Would have got five stars but they were out of ice cream cones... Boo!!!,1
"Its McDonalds.  Drive through is narrow and has a sharp turn, but other than that one thing, it's your standard McD's.",1
This McDonald's is kicking ass and taking names. Puts the others to shame. Love this location.,1
Didn't expect such great drive-thru so early in the morning.,1
Just like all McDonald's!  Nothing special! Always ask for fresh fries!,1
It's ok if you want something fast the people are friendly.,1
I had forgotten to order my cheeseburgers without onions but the lovely man behind the counter had them remade just for me at no charge.,1
"They are always crowded n drive through as well, but the service makes up for it",1
Very good coffee and the service really nice ,1
Good drinks at a decent price. Quick service.,1
This is a busy McDonald's so there is generally a wait at the drive thru and parking lot is tight..,1
Los Angeles. Great service and fast,1
Super fancy electric menu in the drive through. Pretty impressive,1
Great coffee faster services,1
"Just had my ole standby snack:

Dbl-Cheeseburger, small fries and a small coke.  90's High School Lunch!",1

Clean store with fast service. Had the mcgriddle and wow,1
"The same old, the food is bad for you, but it's cheap if you do it right and don't get sucked into the marketing ",1
Fast Happy meal! Accommodating and friendly,1
The McDonald's at Riverside was confusing because there was no River and this McDonald's was not at its side,1
Another McDonald's I frequent. The fries here are a little better than the NoHo one at Burbank Blvd.,1
"That big guy can really sing! Awesome place, awesome singing dude!",1
"Nice location, large and comfy, friendly staff, plenty of parking space.",1
I like this McDonald's out of all of the ones that I have been at because this is the only one that the walk in stay open 24 hours.,1
Sometimes busy. Some days drive through accept only cash.,1
Good service...fresh coffee... I'm coming back !,1
Most convenient McDonalds. It can be busy and you might wait a little longer.,1
My rating is based on my love for the iced turtle.,1
This McDonald's was very satisfying and well organized with very much class,1
Double quarter pounder can't go wrong... with cheese,1
Can't go wrong with a 10-piece chicken McNugget meal,1
Treats food couriers with respect. Restaurant owners take note.,1
fast drive thru considering it was rush hour,1
"It's mc Donald's,. The man before me backed up the toilet and an employee let me use the women's",1
It's cheap but filling and really tasty.,1
"Business is booming, excellent food and fast service",1
This is a good one.  Clean and easy to park.,1
Get food but forgot several items that were bought and paid for unfortunately was too far away to go back,1

"Let me just say, I don't think I've ever gone out of my way to leave a review for a fast food chain. Especially not the biggest in the world. It's so easy to think of these places as just another installment in a gigantic corporation, but I think it's important to remember that these places are made up of the individuals who work there

For that reason, after coming here for a couple of years, I have to say that they do a phenomenal job. I only ever go through the drive-thru, but after being so used to no smiles, miserable demeanors and a lack of basic customer service skills (thank you, have a nice day), I need to shout out how friendly and consistent everyone at the drive-thru line is here.

The women who take your payment are always nice, and even the woman who hands out the food (usually a job where you will get absolutely zero smiles) is always so nice and genuine.

If somebody owns a business and is looking for a good customer service and people who will treat customers as expected, then give people a shot based on everyday encounters like these.",1
"This location was a pleasant experience and in the overnight shift no less. This is, in my recent experience with the fast food industry as a whole (excluding chick FIL a), a rare occurrence and I feel that I have to give some praise here.",1
Here you get hot food and friendly faces! We go there every first Saturday of the month.... And always have a good time.,1
I'm not a McDonald's guy...but the food was hot..the fries were hot and crispy...my burger was hot and juicy and delicious...I'll come back,1
"I was pleased with this McDonald's location all around. I got my food quickly, the service from the speaker to the drive through window cashier was great and my order was accurate.",1
"Fresh hot food! All items in order were correct and served quickly to our table. The cashier was polite and helpful.  My kids really enjoyed the updated play equipment inside their air conditioned play area.
11-2-22 ordered inside using the touch screen. Picked two happy meals(chose NO Toys) and a spicy chicken sandwich meal. Took our table tent to our table to dine-in. Received food shortly after. Happy meals had toys, one was missing its apples and I didn't get my drink. Every thing was corrected without issue, it would just be nice to get everything right the first time. It means to me that someone wasn't paying attention when they should have been.",1
The prices for fast food are crazy. 1.75 for a large sweet tea?? McDonald's corporation is abusing customers for profit.,1
Gave me the wrong breakfast sandwich this time. Ordered a sausage egg and cheese bagel and they gave me a bacon egg and cheese bagel. Still tasted good though,1
Gotta come here on the late night. The two ladys at night that work till 7 am are the best. They are the most pleasant people EVERY TIME WE COME. The food is better. The fries are fresh. Double quarter pounder fresh.  Rose and  Mrs.Shamee the manager. We thank you so much.,1
"Food was got, fresh, and fast.   Also, the ice cream machine works. 占쏙",1
"Came in this morning with low expectations. I rarely do reviews, but I felt compelled to do so after my expectations were blown away. Friendly greeting, clean restaurant,  more of a Cafe feel than fast food. Food came out hot, fresh, and visually as nice as on the commercials. Unexpectedly pleasant experience.  Give this nanagrr a raise.",1
"My favorite time there is around 730am. The hispanic girls who work there are very nice, funny, and friendly!  They even bring the food out to your table when its ready.",1
Great kids area. There is a little toilet for toddlers inside the play place.,1
Service was quick despite longer line. Order has always been correct. Staff is friendly.,1
This was a good McDonald. I퐉 not sure if it was ,1
"Haven't had a messed up order yet, and this location is quick! They handle the volume at peak hours very well. Employees are kind and patient.",1
"To be clear, the rating of 4 stars is perhaps generous (I debated between 3 and 4 stars), but I ate at this McDonald's pretty late, so I'll assume the staff was just tired and ready to go home. The place was fairly clean, and service wasn't terrible, but it wasn't stellar either. They originally forgot the cookies my friend ordered, and when they did get them for him, the didn't have all 3 chocolate chip, so they gave him 2 of those and 1 sugar cookie. I understand that, but rather than just telling him, ""Hey, we got you 2 of those and 1 of these,"" they should have asked, ""Since we only have 2 chocolate chip, can we give you those and 1 sugar cookie?"" That's just polite. Also, the ketchup was out, even though they clearly weren't busy. All this being said, they took the order quickly, apart from that were friendly enough, and got the food out fast without any mistakes (apart from that). If I'm in the area, I might stop by, but the McDonald's in Marlton is much better.",1
The manager Ikea is awesome she provides great customer service she make sure that all her customers are taken care of properly and I just love her friendly friendly Behavior to make sure my food was hot and it got to me quickly I'm happy to see that they are allowing people to eat in now I thought it was rather disturbing closing off the dining room area so I'm very happy about that part,1
Excellent new children's play area.  Very inexpensive kids meals.  We were served within 3 minutes of our order going in.  Not a lot of people-kids there which was even better.  Just wish the menu was a little more adult oriented.,1
"I mean it's  McDonald's. I typically try to stay away from McDonald's but it was the only place open in my area at 1130pm. And no body has sprite like McDonald's usually.The fries were fresh. Definitely should not have eaten the ""beef""羲羲羲羲羲羲 will definitely have your stomach doing jumping Jack's. Lord I bout died on that plane ride back home trying not to traumatized the other passengers and if the sprite doesn't taste like battery acid then it's not McDonald's my sprite was definitely missing the acid",1
"I am a kitchen manager somewhere, i know how important is to keep our customers happy and give a good server, today i was with my family in this so we decided to eat there so my  conclusion is that I got a great service and good food all your employees did amazing job  by the way all of them were women, my family and i had a great moment and meal. THANK YOU SO MUCH",1
"I didn't hate it, I hit the wrong end of the stars. It was very good. My cheeseburger was good and my fries were nice and hot, just the way I like them. So I gave them 5 stars!",1
"They're always clean, the food is so fresh.  There's usually always a line but it's worth it if you want your food fresh and hot!  All staff is nice!",1
"This my first week in America from Novosibirsk Russia. Lady who yell at me like Sargent Captain in Spetsnaz. Cheeseburger have cheese I eat and got lot onion. Lady in front speak Russian, so she is sweetheart. I taste better food in Russia when I sent to the detention center but American love Cheeseburger very FAT! ",1
"For a McDonald, I퐉 actually very impre",1
"Drive thru line was pretty long.  Put on my mask and walked in. Ordered and item was in a bag ready to go in 2min.
New pastries are wonderful.",1
"My old clock on August 23, 2017",1
"Newly renovated, it's all shiny and new. I like the self-ordering kiosks they're putting in McDonald's; speeds everything up once you get the hang of it.
The chocolate shake had both vanilla and chocolate; I liked it that way but they really should get that fixed. Going back for a bacon big Mac.",1
"Best bagels, great quick service with a smile! Always on my way to work and the food and service is on point! We Voorhees Township girls love it!,",1
"It's McD's. Service here is always good, but quality is variable. It's usually good, but sometimes it's off... Bun is stale, fries are cold. Employees seem a notch above usual fast food.

Update Oct 2019: Last three times I've been, my Quarter Pounder bun has been stale and the ""never frozen"" patty was over-done and served way too fast to be cooked-to-order.  Disappointed that their quality is going down-hill.  The never-frozen 1/4 pound patties are worlds better than the frozen ones when they're cooked properly.",1
First time at this location. Very clean and fast. They recently updated kids play area and lobby. The play area has a large tablet for kids to play at NO CHARGE! As well as a few other new items.,1
"The drive through was very quick (the fastest I've experienced in many years - think NASCAR pitstop), the order was accurate, and the food was fresh & tasty.",1
Always a good value.Use the APP and save.Big Mac,1
"Inside was faster than drive thru. Clean, fast, and accurate with my order. I would go to them again.",1
"I haven been able to be in since the remodel has been completed. I really remember that the food was delicious & the Mc frappes were excellent & delicious. Even the coffee, tea,  & soda as well. Maybe it",1
Very clean store. Staff was excellent!,1
Best customer service around ,1
Hard working team!! I stop by during the morning shifts and they are always professional. They need a raise!,1
McDonalds is my go to fast food restaurant. It has been the only place since my son was a baby that we have been able to go to get a quick bite to eat due to his severe dairy allergy. Yes they have a dairy free meal for him and for me a gluten free meal. A match you can't beat. I won't say how old my son is but McDonalds has been ahead of their time for over two decades now when it comes to having special meals. It's been a great place for our family to go.,1
"Breakfast this morning-sausage mcmuffin with egg, hash brown, and orange juice. Great service.",1
Had a great time at a fundraiser.,1
Very clean. The staff was extremely friendly. The cashier went out of his way to get my kids happy meals before 11am which was super awesome of him.,1
"The staff here, albeit like most McDonald's, is packed with teenagers. However, I've found them to be respectful, and polite. I've never had an issue with an order, or service.",1
The new renovations for this location look amazing.  Touch screen ordering makes sure I can get exactly what I want.  The new play area looks like a blast!,1
Food was great service was fast and workers were friendly,1
Has a nice playground for the kids. Very clean on the inside. Workers are very friendly. The bathroom could be a little cleaner and more appropriate for children to wash their hands.,1
"Friendly staff and a clean restaurant, the food is great. Awesome place to bring kids. I just wish this one had a covered playground like the other locations.",1
I go to this McDonalds a couple times a week I am addicted to the sweet tea lol this is the only McDonalds I will get sweet tea at as I have never gotten a bad one here trust me you can tell if a place cleans there ice tea bins because the tea will taste bad that never happens here. Their food is really good also.,1
Always Fresh and Hot Food ...Great Customer service..!!!,1
Very clean ..,1
"Quick service at drive thru, and dine in area is always clean.",1
"I have not been on the inside of a McDonald's in years. What a great surprise! It had a minimalist vibe, technologically up to date, was clean and the service was quick.",1
Food was fresh its always aline Sunday mornings but service is good and fast.. Best of all Fresh Fries everytime I went..,1
"First time at this particular restaurant.  I found the food hot, and the counter help friendly and efficient.",1
"I only purchased a soda, but everyone is very friendly every time I go There.. ",1
Staff are very courteous and polite.,1

Five stars for service.  This McDonald's should be a training store for managers. The manager and his entire crew were all about keeping the orders coming and making the customer job one. Haven't experienced this at a McDonald's in a long time. This McDonald's should be the standard the others have to meet.,1
Dine in area is fairly clean & they even have a nice sized playplace for the kids in a separate area from the main dining area. Staff is nice & quick.,1
"very nice and respectful customer service, and clean bathrooms!",1
Usually order ahead in the app and do curbside pickup. Process is easy and discounts are nice through the app. No issues with service or food quality at this location.,1
Enjoyed watching our two boys play in play area.,1
"Fast food, friendly staff, and ok coffee.",1
Went to work this day I was pressed for time but the drive-thru was very fast,1
"I think the morning shift are one of, if not the best, they provide great customer service and good food, definitely coming more to this McDonald占쏙",1
If you like McDonalds  this is s good one.  I like McDonalds.  占쏙,1
"They always have the nicest staff, and the tables and bathrooms are always clean. I can't figure out why people don't just accept the Golden Arches. The food is good, and nutritious. You don't need to order a big mac every time! Just get a salad!",1
"The interior was something I'd never seen before. There were planted boards you could use to place your order before reaching the counter, but the line was short so it wasn't needed. The place was clean and all the orders were right. It was a nice stop for a sit-down quick lunch like how fast food should be.",1
"This location has a fun indoor playroom area. The play equipment always seems to be clean and well-maintained. I take my two-year-old granddaughter there occasionally, and she always has fun. The only reason for the four out of five stars is because their projection screen/interactive play mat has not worked properly since we have been visiting there over the last year. It has partially worked on a couple of occasions and my granddaughter remembers that she enjoyed it. Every time we퐎e there she stomps on it to try to make it work. She will grab my hand and pull me over to the mat and try and get me to make it work. I",1
"I'll always come back here. The food's always right and the store and bathroom is always clean. Nobody bothers you. I even ate pizza here and the management didn't seem to care and it's a good place to eat and work. There aren't too many good McDonald's you can find a good plug in for your laptop but this one is awesome.

The staff is good and very helpful every time I go there. One day I was low on money but really had to eat. One of the guys who worked there gave me a break and upsized my drink as a courtesy. It was hot as $h&t outside and I had a longer lasting drink to curve the heat.",1
"Actually an especially above average location.  Service and food are what should be expected.  Clean.  Restroom has hands free door opener.  Kids Play Place is especially nice.  Has modern play equipment, toddler area and interactive life size video game station.",1
I can only speak to their breakfast as it's the only thing I've purchased there. Service is fast and the food is great.,1
"Best McDonald's around!
The people who work there are always super nice, the service is very good compared to other McDonald's in this area. And there are NOT any of those horrible self serve kiosks! Oh how I hate those things!!!
The restaurant is clean and we'll maintained.
This is my favorite!",1
We love coming here. Tried the Shamrock Mcflurry and it was delicious!,1
Their employees needs to learn customer service.,1
"Every once in awhile you just got to have a quarter pounder. Today it was a quarter pounder with fries and a Coke. So good. The Quarter Pounders are made with fresh meat now and you can really taste the difference. And everyone knows that McDonald's has the best Fountain Coke. They tested a couple of times per hour just to ensure the formula is Right. Plus, they have those nice fat straws that make for big sips. :-)",1
We did dine in. But used the app to order the food and it was ready in a reasonable time. We also got to enjoy the AC and sit inside and eat.,1
They made a mistake on my order but I hadn't left the parking lot yet. I called them and told them and they gave me the correct sandwich right away. Great service!,1
"What makes this place 5 star to me is the Manager.......Nikko!

Nikko is super friendly, genuinely caring about HONEST customers and makes you wanna come back for some of his cheer.
Service is great here with seldom a mistake in the mornings when I come in.
Th",1
I've ubered and ordered at this particular McDonald's and I've always had a positive experience. They don't ignore you and they actually get to their customers in the order that they are in. Great team up there and positive work attitude!,1
Who doesn't love McDonalds fries... quick service it always fast not really a long wait... Mmmmmm fries.....,1
"Love this spot. Convenient location right off of major highways, food is prepared properly, drive-thru turns over quickly, coffee is delicious. No complaints. This is what every McDonald's should be like.",1
"Fast service, hot fries fresh burgers. It's McD's. Somehow the food is fresher in our drive thru only world...

People at this one always are nice considering they need to deal with peeps like me that never know what they want. It's been the same basic menu for decades. LOL",1
It's a pretty nice McDonald's. Not highest quality of food of course cuz it's fast food but I like the fries and getting deals. I've tried the mobile order a few times too and it's cool how they bring it to you and feels like there's less wait.,1
"If you don't know what you're getting into when you go to a McDonald's, you're probably coloring more often than reading. My Sprite tasted EXACTLY like Sprite.",1
"I wouldn't normally write a review, especially for a McDonalds that I go to often, but recently I have been going through the drive through and have seen a man that has twice as much enthusiasm as anybody else working there. I believe his name is Brandon, but every time I go he always seems to brighten my day.",1
"Some people still swear that McDonald's has the best coffee. It's not my personal favorite, but it's good and inexpensive. Discounts for seniors. Love the value meal selections too.",1
Very clean lobby and facility. Coffee was fresh. Service was quick.,1
The kiddos love to stop by and play in the play places.  This location has a bathroom in the play area which is awesome for the potty training years.  The resturant and play area was very clean and staff was around every so often to check on the cleaniness.  This is one of our favorite locations to visit.,1
Classic fast food with addictive french fries. Burgers are prepared and cooked the same across the US. Consistency and quality are worth each visit.,1
Always enjoy this McDonald's and I am not a fan of the food. The food is hot and correct majority of the time. The play area is great and staff is friendly. Keep up the good work.,1
They were wicked fast and very friendly! I had actually stopped going to any McDonalds because of bad experiences elsewhere with really dry nuggets. Did not regret getting food there today.,1
"Always fast, their food always tastes much more delicious than other mcdonalds.",1
"Clean play area for children, minimal staff but working hard. I asked for veggie sandwhich because I am a vegitarian, i said ""lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, onion stuff like that"" but my sandwhich came out with pickles and cheese. :0( they took it back put a tomatoe and 1 peace of lettuce on it. I wish McDonalds had a nice big veggie sandwich to fill me up.",1
"I just want to say
1. MCDonalds does NOT take phone orders!also you would not believe the amount of prank calls they get a night
2. There hasn",1
First time in a long time that I have been to McDonald's and the staff actually treated me like they appreciated my being a customer. I took off 1 star because they were stingy with the mayo on my hamburger.,1
They are doing a remodel for the lobby. But the drive through was open. Associate was very nice and we had a nice conversation while waiting on the food.,1
"They have big macs :) but no all day breakfast :(... mobile app works well though, make sure you activate the order when u arrive ""I'M HERE"" or no one will know what you're talking about",1
THE STAFF WAS KIND AND COURTEOUS. THEY QUICKLY CORRECTED MY ORDER WHEN I RECEIVED IT WITHOUT KETCHUP OR BBQ SAUCE,1
You are sure of a good meal every time! Had a great brunch there today.,1
Awesome vanilla cones!!,1
"My over 20 year experience with McDonald's Restaurants in this area (Southlake, Grapevine, Keller, Northlake, and north FW) This one is by far the best one. I have been eating food regularly from this Roanoke McDonald's for a little over a year now.  This is the only place that makes the Big Mac the way I remember it as a kid. I do not post reviews often at all. I am making this one because of my experiences at all of the area McDonalds. If you decide to eat McDonald's, go to this one.",1
That was the best quarter pounder I've had in years! .for real! Every once in awhile it's great. I would have taken a picture...but I wasn't thinking. Picture perfect,1
"Ate inside,  food was fine and order was correct.    Overall was a good visit.    Just wish was a little cleaner of a restaurant.",1
I think this place is under new management. I had a quarter pounder and it was really good and made right. Friendly service and very clean.,1
"Great neighborhood McD. It's not open 24/7, but has enough friendly staff to keep its drive through going while quickly serving your order if you're inside.",1
"Unfortunately they got my order wrong, but I still gave 4 stars bevause the employees are always so nice and friendly.",1
"Good food,friendly service and pretty quick as well",1
Iced mocha is awesome they make it just right ,1
Guys just to let you know. I hate McDonald's!.... I just keep coming back and knowing that's its killing me. What I'm trying to say is that im addicted and I cant stop eating. I eat because I'm unhappy and I'm unhappy cause I eat. Lol 5 star,1
"Clean and good service. The only problem is the drive through window always open because the busy order during morning, flies get in easily.",1
"Came here for McDonald's, was not disappointed.... Loved the arches, some lady hit the curb behind me, kinda funny. Food and service were great.",1
It's a McDonald's- standard to a fault.  Has a pretty clean interior but not a lot of booth seating.  The food is what you would expect from McDonald's,1
Good drive thru setup. Orders have been correct every time.,1
"They get the order right, the good is always hot.  The kids enjoy the play place and the whole place is clean.",1
"Best mc Donalds EVA!!!
they made for me fresh coffee (super quick) , and the cookies were just baked, you made my night guys!",1
Took my nephew to play & eat. First one ive been to with a working interactive floor projection game. Suited my needs,1
Not a big fan of McDonald's but I do love their fries and cheeseburgers!,1
This is a McDonald's so the food is normal and good I liked the service here and would come again,1
"Best damn McDonalds I've ever been too,  best of service and finally all orders were right!! Rock on",1
"This is the best McDonalds around. They always get it right , fresh and fast",1
Amazing Night Crew and Management! Very professional and friendly staff. Great Service!,1
Fastest drive thru McDonalds in the area. Friendly customer service. The restaurant kids area is always clean and kept up.,1
"I am not usually a fan of Mickey D's, but this is a great place for a good fast breakfast. A great staff.

Lance",1
Surprisingly friendly service,1
Efficient even when busy. Can't speak for the inside but clean parking lot and drive thru lane.,1
Keep up the good work. The food was hot and fresh. Super impressed with this facility.,1
"It's McDonald's .. always reliable, wide menu, consistently original tastes. Get the app for some fantastic deals!",1
great job,1
Always great service  one of the faster drive-thru,1
Just like any other McDonalds. The bathrooms are clean and the service is good.,1
You have it your way at McDonald's always good and fast,1
"The food is good the service is fast, but they ALWAYS seem to screw up your order or and forget something.  Napkins, utensils eta.",1
Always good service and friendly.,1
Food was great this morning. Need to turn A/C on so it's not so moist n humid inside.,1
"We know that the order is good quality and we can count on getting exactly what we order.
Thanks",1
Getting better but better check your order,1
Food is good . Drive thru line takes too long .,1
"Fun for the kids, the staff was nice, and the food was good for McDonald's. The AC was great :)",1
When you gotta have your Big Mac fix there's no place like this.,1
Staff was efficient and polite & many compliments on the cleanliness of the play area.,1
They have separate AC for their play area which is awesome.,1
Always love me a Royale with cheese,1
Clean and friendly . Great deals on the McDonald's app. Check it out .,1

This McDonald's has great customer service but the fries weren't the best;  I've noticed the fry problem at other MickeyD's.... seems to go along with the omnipresent employee shortage ,1
We read previous reviews and thought about changing our dining plans. Glad we didn't everything was as McDonald's advertises.,1
"clean bathroom and wonderful staff! always helpful when it comes to confusing times, and orders.",1
"Ordered triple burger with no ban.
Like this place cause ot is new and inviting.
But crew don't have time to take care of the tables.
Wish all customers take care after themselves.
Keep this place clean.
So much was invested!",1
We had a very good experience here from the day crew.  Manager was super friendly staff was organized.  It's the very first time that I didn't have to take my burger out and place all the ingredients in it myself because it was sloppy.  Burgers were picture perfect. Props to the cook and line for a job well done.,1
Most times I just stop in for a snack and get fries because they are always fresh and HOT!!,1
Excellent service just got in to rush hour at the lunch time but it took less then 3 minutes to get the food!,1
They always get the food out super fast and always seem to be in a good mood it's a great location the times I have not had a good time are few and far between so keep being awesome 占쏙,1
I got a delicious Quarter Pounder.  For $0.70 they added lettuce and tomato.  With medium fries and drink my meal cost $7.24.,1
"My experience with this McDonald's was a good one. I did not experience any poor treatment from the staff. In fact, the young lady who took my order was pleasant and helpful. No attitude, no acting like she had better things to do, she treated me very well, even joked with me a bit because I wanted a shake but, the ice cream machine was down for cleaning. My order was correct and EXACTLY what I wanted and was done in a speedy manner given how busy they were. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I didn't get my shake. LOL",1
"We ate here twice in a row, this McDonald is awesome from the cleanliness to t",1
Nice place to take breakfast  or delicious lunch and customer service available any time you walk inside,1
We went inside this time so I could use expiring points. The man who helped me was so patient and helpful with me figuring out the app. Didn't act like I was putting him out either!,1
"I came in having a bad day, and the manager noticed that I was frustrated because everyone was busy when I walked in. Long story short.... The manager paid for my meal with a smile. Great customer service!",1
It,0
Best Macdonalds ever. They have nice ladies and they're open 24 7. They are connected to the pilot truck stop. They also have a drive thru on the west side of the building.,1
This was a convenient place to stop and grab something to eat on our way home from a movie. They were busy and I was thinking it would take a while but they had employees who knew what they were doing. And we were able to get our order within 5 minutes and they got it right.,1
Fresh food service great lunch break location.,1
"A distinguished man who held himself as if he were the manager at McDonalds warned an older woman that the fries were hot. The human touch was awesome! (The employee is a handsome black man, nice build. I saw this: 1/18/19 6:40pm)",1
"Not bad service. They were fast, not super friendly but not mean. The food they served me was actually pretty well done. They did give me the wrong sauce I asked for though.",1
"I was very impressed with the attitude of Mr. Vincent, Miss Lexy and Miss Jordan.
These young people have potential to be whatever they set their head to.
The owner of this establish has reason to be proud of these precious employees.
What can I say more than stop by,  say hello and enjoy the great atmosphere of these teens working in harmony to meet the needs of their customers.",1
Fast paced!! The food was hot and was the way I ordered it,1
"A wonderful quick stop here before the start of an extended shift!!!! Made quick and fresh for your desire of, literally, Fast Food :)",1
"Ok here complaint. You serve breakfast bisque bacon egg and cheese. But you don't serve bacon egg and cheese bagels after 12pm.
I find that unacceptable it's on your menu and you are a business that is seeking to make a buck. You seek to have positive numbers on your income. So why it is such big deal that you can't serve me a bagel after 12pm? I'm the customer and put money in your pocket. You need to rethink your way of treatment of your customers. I can buy anything on your menu at anytime.",1
"This parking lot is congested it's hard to move around on this lot. Plus I just witness a horrible case of road rage.  McDonalds need a better layout to avoid all of this dangerous nonsense. However,  I had and ice cream cone that was absolutely delicious. Yum!",1
"Clean store and both cook and cashier were polite, drinks and food decent",1
"Out of all the McDonald int he area, this one is always on the ball with their quality",1
Went in late . No one was at the counter  at first but the one who was visible was cleaning the grill and the area by that saw me and realized i had been waiting took my order.washed her hands and made my double quarter VB pounder just right.i frequent this store and that is a first.,1
"Wow, staff is best ever.Had food done within a minute.Very friendly, plus excellent food. Thank you staff ..",1
"The girls that work here are the sweetest!!! Forgot to catch her name, but she worked the night of 4-10-17. She was soooo friendly!! My daughter just loved her! Thank you!! And look at this french fry...looks like a face ;)",1
Typical Mcdonald. Decent tasting food and reasonably priced. They performed as expected,1
Questionable people in the area outside but solid staff,1
"I'm not a big fan of McDonald's and this restaurant didn't change my mind. The food was the same as all McDonald's, service was good and their prices were reasonable, as are all McDonald's I've ever visited. They are consistent!",1
Nice kids working here. But! $3.00 for fries? Really?,1
I never really have a problem with McDonald's it was good,1
"It's McDonalds, pumping out the food and moving the feed line.
What else need to be said??
How about BRING BACK THE CHICKEN TENDERS!!",1
"Food was good, order was correct which is very rare nowadays",1
"Food was fresh at this McDonald's.
I travel all over the country and its rare to get fresh at McDonald's but ty this store nailed it!!!!
Ty for making sure we eat well.
",1
"It's a McDonalds. The food is consistent and delicious, if you like McDonalds.",1
"Good service ,only thing I didn't like was no milk..",1
I wish they would bring back the two for $ 5.00 Big Macs.,1
"Good food for people on the road, and they also have a IHOP I know right, just not In the store, just a little blocks and you퐇l see it, it",1
Shoutout to this McDonald for being the only place to acce,1
"I walked in and I was the only one there at 6:45 p.m. on a Wednesday. Ordered Quarter Pounder and large fry and took forever to get it, but it was hot and fresh",1
"My opinion is that Management and staff do not speak English well so Customer Service is not at the level it should be
I did have to wait longer than expected but my food was fresh Can't complain about that
Thanks",1
Got double quarter pounder for me and my driver. It was delicious.,1
This McDonald's food tasted very good its was fresh and delicious hot and hadn't been setting under a heat lamp,1
Melissa the manager at night gave me a great customer service...... She knows how to take care of customers when there is a problem....... good job Melissa...... see u in the next time when I'm in town.....thx,1
OMG My food is always fresh and hot. The service is friendly and fast.,1
It was delicious I had to double bacon cheeseburger first time there they did and excellent job !!,1
"Friendly and patient guy at the window especially early in the morning, great sweet tea made perfect and our breakfast was hot and fresh",1
"Very nice,friendly, courteous workers with great attitudes. Would definitely recommend this Mc Donald's",1
The food is well prepared and the employees are professional. My only issue is the lack of electric plugs near the booths to charge phones and laptops.,1
"08/26/19 17:00
Excellent customer service, friendly employees. Wish they were also running the Pilot!!!",1

"In a sea of overpriced and mediocre food within the mega corporation casinos, this humble McDonald's is a reasonably priced breath of fresh air.  Just a good ol' Mickey D's with real world prices.",1
"Excellent working staff. Super clean dining area and kitchen. Super helpful staff, cant praise them enough. If looking for a restroom, you do Need to ask for the code and theyll let you in. We were here on a Wednesday at 1pm.",1
"Pretty good. The Sprites they gave us tasted like seltzer (apparently they had  just ran out) but they made it up to us with a different soda. And their fries were hot, fresh, crisp, & salty , just the way I like them. Fyi-there's limited parking in front facing LV Boulevard but in the back there are a lot of spaces.",1
"Same as any other McDonald's except they were super busy and no one was available to take orders, if you're paying cash, for a while. One of the coffees we ordered had grounds. Food was hot and ok.",1
"First time visiting this McDonald's location. The staff was nice, the food was good. Service was fine for a fast food place. Nothing phenomenal or out of the ordinary to report. Pricing feels amazing compared to the Mandalay Bay Convention Center's (across the street prices) for their food.",1
First time using the touch screen ordering system. Pretty easy. Manager/ supervisor seemed to have an off-putting attitude. A smile goes a long way. Food was hot and fresh and correct.,1
"Food was better than most other McDonalds; fries fresh, hot, well seasoned and mcchicken was crispy. Tasted really good!",1
"Walked All the way from Luxor for dinner and before food I always used the restroom But there was RESTROOM AND IT WAS OUT OF ORDER
Come on McDonald's
Please Fix it
Thank You!!",1
They charge more for the same food because it's on the strip. I never understood that. But the food and the service were great at the drive thru!,1
"Typical McD's... Food is exactly what you'd expect. Same with the service.
Atmosphere was a little unusual, but it's Vegas.",1
"Luisa, the manager is great. She resolved an issue & went above & beyond what she was expected to do. Thanks for everything.",1
These people are nice. Quick service. I enjoyed my time here. The staff are repectful and colorful. Very vibrant crew. Clean and respectfully kept up to par. Keep it up please. This is the service you never expect but never regret. Thanks. Next time I come back to vegas I'll be back.,1
I am loving the comment by the guy below who comes here after mass but gets upset at the all homeless people. Irony is not dead ,1
"Parking is difficult but other than that, it's McDonald's. The fries will always be the best.",1
"Unique,Andrew, had amazing customer service, and my food came out fresh.",1
"Boca Park McDonald's is by far the best McDonald's in the Las Vegas Valley. The staff not only keeps the place spotless, they truly care about the customers. They let you charge your phone if you need to. They have fresh flowers on some of the tables, and of course a play area for children.",1
"Clean environment, fast and finally service, I really like the decor and style of the place. Cheap food in a ridiculously expensive City",1
They only had a couple of working kiosks but you can also order at the cashier. The service is fast and my food came out fresh. A few of the drinks had run out but there was still a good variety.,1
"We visited this McDonald's around 3 weeks ago just for 2 drinks after visiting the welcome to Vegas sign. I was surprised how clean the place was fresh flowers on the tables, service was quick and friendly even though there was a queue.
Hot a caramel frappuccino and a strawberry milkshake both came beautifully presented.
Can't say a bad thing about this store keep up the good work guys 5* ",1
Who thinks of reviewing a fast food place?  Well if you receive outstanding service from a teenager working hard then the establishment and all the employees deserve a 5-star rating. Not only did the employee flawlessly do his job. He took the time to observe my car while in the drive thru to tell me my tire was going flat. We all know that could have been disastrous had I kept going. Great job!,1
"Lovely staff and amazingly quick service for my big order. Impressive quality and great nuggets with sizzling hot fries. The place is big enough and very clean. However, I noticed the pop machine wasn't working properly and spills cock around which needed a look. Good experience overall.",1
A very nice place. You can feel at ease and enjoy quality time with your family and friends.,1
"For 6am, the staff was pleasant, the service was fast, & I even used the self ordering kiosk.l Where it's at, there is no lack of homeless & panhandling, so if you need the restroom, an employee will let you in, and don't be surprised if it is below standards, or seeing someone sleeping at a booth. On a brighter note... The line at the drive-thru window moves swiftly, and there is a bus stop along the sidewalk, for the North bound Las Vegas Strip bus.",1
"So busy we had to wait 30 minutes for our food! Yet I have never seen a more efficient food production line. They were serving numbers already in the 900s when we arrived at 11am! Very clean,  courteous.",1
"First time at this location.  The drive thru young lady was so sweet and had great communicating skills when she took my order and when she took my payment. The lady at the next window, who gave me my food was very friendly too. Great staff! At first I didn't want to got to a Mcds in the strip but I'm glad I did! Thank you guys!",1
"All around the inside is Fair. but need to check air vents its dirty. All Soda Machine need to be constantly  watched because  when its busy it gets nasty and dirty .. floor looks clean but need more cleaning. and the windows all around need to be cleaned, and of course the frame.

Very Impressive One As far as the overall look.

Managers and Staff need to be reminded and or trained that a Franchise who really depends on Customers to have more happy people to come to visit and eat here.

Customer Service is Very Poor. Your Cashier Staff or Front Staff is not following their training. And why is it I walk in and I was stared by your staff and like they don't like to be friendly and all showing , how great and wonderful to have a job ..that lets you interact with people ..This is one of the most questioned part of Hiring. Are a People Person? Are good or happy to be around People. ETC.,

The Outside Area is good , Actually better than good.

Food is very good , but prepared Sloppy on my tray and the way it was wrap and coffee I have to dump some because they fill it to the top. I mean they can save a lot of coffee expense and time making sure ask the customer if they want it fill to the top or not...

So, you have good location ,, ok dining area , staff not satisfied, not customer service oriented plus the Manager is he or she really watching the staff and or helping to correct any discrepancies or problems?

This is THE MC DONALD WHO GENERATE  a lot of the revenue because of its best quality fast food deals and environment ...and GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.",1
"As McDonald's goes it was that. However the food genuinely looked like the picture. It was clearly made to order. Wish I could've used the restrooms. I guess they didn't know that you can block off every other sink, urinal, stall or whatever. It was the last free standing McDonald's with parking southbound from Vegas. Bottom of Vegas Blvd.",1
McDonalds is always our go to place. Your welcomed by friendly staff. You know what your getting before venturing in. They offer everything from standard to a healthy menu. I like how they are more modern in there decor. McDonalds stands behind the quality and standards of there food. The only restaurant I know of that will refund or replace items.,1
Was on vacation and location was very convenient... Over all nice and clean and great customer service...Ordered the spicy ckn sandwiches(4 to be exact) and NOTHING like back home.. Overcooked with a pinch of sauce.. Burnt and dry as the desert.. Definitely would've said something if I was dining in.. I visited 2 more times before I left.. Didn't complain about ckn sandwiches and ordered different food it was just OK... Must say they are stingy with sauce,1
Great service. One rude employee seemly didn't want to perform her job duties.,1
Evening visit. Very friendly employees. Large & clean dining room. Food was good quality. They took the tea dispensers to the back. I asked for a refill and they happily obliged. I will return. Thank you!,1
"We used drive-thru in the late evening hours. Service was time efficient, food was good. Fench fries were fresh and delicious. It just hit the spot on that late evening as  we headed to our hotel. Five stars!!!",1
"Great as always , cheap and cheerful",1
"I'm staying at the Mandalay Bay hotel. My wife my wife's friend and I got sick of paying $100 total each meal so we decided to slum it and go to McDonald's.  Can't beat $30 total that includes ice cream. I think I paid $25 for a single Margarita daiquiri poolside.  It was clean, service was prompt and it wasn't too crowded.  You get what you expect at McDonald's and that's all you're asking for.  Cheap fast good tasting food.  So if you're staying at the Mandalay Bay hotel and you're looking for something cheap take the 5 minute walk and head over to McDonald's.  You will only feel a little guilty.",1
"Very busy and understaffed, and they are doing a great job! Food was hot and the staff was amazing and polite under pressure. A+++!!",1
"Located outside the downtown and close to Las Vegas Sign, offers some vintage atmosphere.",1
Used kiosk to place order and was delivered quickly even with a wrap around line at drive thru. Great service.,1
"First time in a McDonald's in Las Vegas had to travel to the far south end of the strip... It's nice despite it being more remote. Stopped in on my way to the famous Las Vegas sign, it's clean good service despite it being Thanksgiving morning. Its a good place to come before you get to the hairy crazy part of the Las Vegas strip.",1
"Food , service and price was great,  gave 4 stars because you have to go to the register and get a pin code to get in the restroom,. I didn't have time to wait in line to get the code. Other then that everyone was very mice and great service",1
I was looking for some cheap food and found this within walking distance of the end of the strip. Not crazy busy and pretty clean. The service is pretty quick and clean restrooms. The prices aren,1
81584 for the potty room love ya,1
Priced for thr Strip... The Manager needs to not yell at the employees in front of the customers. Wow... Nice ladies who work there. Have some respect from management. Went around 11:30 am on Friday.,1
"It was McDonald's. You know what you're going there for and it is always quick and acceptable.

If you are expecting a linen table cloth and candles you are in the wrong place. If you are expecting quality food at a good price and rapidly - you found McDonald's!",1
"Standard McDonald's food except I notice they give half the bacon that other McDonalds I've been to, with hotcakes. It's a convenient walk from Mandalay Bay when you're just tired of spending a ton of money and waiting in line for a mediocre breakfast at the hotel.

The ice coffee is very weak so stick to hot coffee if you need the caffeine boost.

The bathrooms are locked so you'll have to ask for a key.",1
"For a McDonald's... this was the best experience I've had and the food was fresh, fast, not sloppy, accurate, staff was awesome. I mean it's fast food and a McDonald's of all things but... It was good enough I had to review it.",1
Not everything is overpriced in Las Vegas. Sometimes there is nothing better than a McDonald's. You know what you get and how much it is going to cost,1
This McDonalds location is okay. The food is always tastes great! I like how they have WiFi here. So I was able to eat and get my work done. The staff here are nice! I like this environment and commend this place.,1
"Fast service, online order pickup was prompt and ready to go upon arrival. Open late [early] and walking distance from Mandalay Bay. Only restaurant open besides Subway during twilight hours in the area.",1
This McDonalds is like home and has a good down to earth vibe. I would of gave five stars but the hang ups I have is the homeless people in the drive thru constantly begging. Its just getting really annoying. Like I wanna order my food and eat without being bothered. I hope the get a little more mindful of that. Also many times I order something and they often forget to put everything I'm the bag. I know this mcdonalds gets a lot of traffic and is busy but those are the only pickles I have.,1
"Very busy
Staff were ok.
Didn't have lemon for my tea",1
"I eat here for lunch a lot and I've never seen a ton of homeless people here. I see one once in a while outside, but that's it. Food is served fast and fries are hot! I love it here.",1
Nice service by the employees very satisfactory. Some of the people seemed to not have to go anywhere. Taking up places to sit for families but quick and pleasant.,1
Busy but has lots of kiosks to speed up the process.,1
Service support for drive-thru  was excellent! I asked for fresh food (Chicken nugget combo with large half cut Ice tea). It was worth the wait.  Thank you,1
"Quick drive through. A little tight parking lot in the front of the restaurant, but additional parking in back. Conveniently close to Mandalay Bay, Luxor, etc. on east side of Las Vegas Blvd.",1
"Got the big breakfast and it really hit the spot.
Didn't like it that the employee wasn't all that helpful about their menu availability at 430 am.
But the breakfast was good.",1
Ordered inside to go. It was very busy. Took 20 minutes to get my order.,1
"Same menu as every McDonald's everywhere, and the quality is just fine. The big advantage of this location is that it's just off the strip, so it has more normal prices, and it's not as crowded.",1
We stayed at the Tropicana and didnt want to pay $21.95 each for breakfast so we went here.  It was a 10 minute walk ( it's across from Mandalay Bay) and encountered 2 homeless men along the way but it was worth the walk.  Food and service were excellent and the prices the same as other McDonalds.   The place is new and clean.   The is also a Subway in the strip mall.   Highy recommend if you can stand the heat durind the walk.,1
"Ordered 5  mocha frappes, the order was made correctly. The cashier was friendly courteous and make me smile while we waited",1
Beautiful sign. And I always love McDonald's.,1
Typical MCDONALD'S. Nothing fancy. Half price happy meals when mom doesn't want to cook!,1
"Service was good. Even got my burger med. Rare, just how i like it ",1
Right across the street from The Mandalay Bay makes this place the perfect go to for a quick bite. Great service and great food. Parking on the premises. Enjoy!,1
"All the people that work there are very nice, efficient, and as fast as they can possibly be to get your order filled and served in a timely manner. That whole crew is an A+",1
Wish my food would have been a lil hotter and a lil more fresh- but hey that's fast food for ya!,1
Hot summer day. And it was soo cool inside. And soo Clean. Thanks everyone.. ps. Only got my Fix. Ice Coffee. Small.,1
"Went tonight and the girls were awesome! We forgot to say no salt on fries,  they remade them. They were very hospitable!",1
Delicious food great hamburgers great breakfast menu I especially like the sausage egg McMuffin I also like the quarter pounder with cheese actually all of their items on the menu are very tasty,1
My hat goes off to the lady that's works there. Don't know her name but she was pregnant. She was working the front counter and drive thur at the same time. Do not complain about it.,1
"Fast, clean, efficient. Everything you want from a McDonalds. A great place to stop for a snack before venturing in to the pricier parts of the LV strip.",1
It's faster to order inside restaurant than go through the drive thru.,1
"Wow open 24 hours, went here at 3 am ordered food then pasted out on the table the employees here are awesome",1
Longer wait time in drive thru. But good service,1
Had breakfast here most mornings,1
"Hard working, very friendly staff. Hit breakfast.
No military discount.",1
Quick stop at McDonald's. They were fast and service was friendly.,1
"Standard for a McD's, I didn't see any child booster seats or high chairs for the young ones but like other reviewer said you don't have to go into a casino, where people are drinking and smoking, a plus for me.",1
For a quick meal. And to get out of the cold or heat. It can be very crowded at certain times. No Wi-Fi.,1
Had a egg mcmuffin and coffee it was good,1
Nice to see fairly normal prices and not Las Vegas Boulevard prices! We had super friendly service!,1
"My favorite place to eat and hang out.
Great atmosphere and great set up for the dining area.
Great prices!",1
McDonald's is good place to eat but they might get some orders wrong but it's still ok cause they have this thing where they are making food from all different McDonalds in different countries,1
Generally good service but the last few times I've had to pull ahead on the drive thru line and wait an unusually lengthy time.,1
"It's a McDonalds so you already know what to expect. However, while hotel food is wonderful, this is a welcome break from the noise and prices when you need it.",1
I love that McDonald's the employees are always friendly the food is always fresh,1
"Standardized meals at a very reasonable price point. For the budget traveler.
Minimum rush. Fast service. For on the go meals.",1
Drive thru always friendly & courteous. Food is hot & served  pretty quickly,1
Like always excellent service some good food,1
Mcbitchin- mcdouble plus spicy chicken. Take one bun off and put them together as one. Best marriage in food.,1

"There was a wrap menu that is not found in Japanese mornings.
I think it would be even better if it had vegetables in it!",1
Good place to eat fast and cheap,1
Refreshments on the main street not far from the famous Welcome to Las Vegas sign. There is free parking and a great view of the beginning of Las Vegas. I must say that the food was tasty and everything was clean. Thanks,1
"morning mac

Participated in an exhibition in the United States to promote the detoxifying effect of Yaeyama chlorella.
Morning Mac at McDonald's near the venue. The difference from Japan is that you put your own drinks.",1
American experience... Not too much difference with France!,1
"Friendly staff, trying to help if you don't know much English (like me). The BigMc tastes like it does in Germany, but the DoppelBeff is incredibly tasty and the fat drips out, but you have to eat it when you're there",1
"This fast food restaurant chain offers, among its main products, hamburgers, French fries, breakfast menus, soft drinks, milkshakes, ice creams, desserts and fruit salads, service It is very fast and of very good quality.",1
"I like it, even though I know you can't always eat it. But I end up here several times a year.",1
This is a pretty automated McDonald. Probably one of the most automated ones I퐒e come across. Many of the customers went strait to the devices shown to enter their order and just stood near the pick up counter for their order. I felt the process was still a bit slow given that the emphasis is for automation though. Plus the area to stand was congested since it,1
"This maybe the cleanest McDonald I ever been to. I pass 2 closer ones from my house just to come to this one because of cleanliness, good",1
"More than 30 min of wait 2 buses should have arrived and both routes are late. I don't get it, if  paying with our taxes for this service plus a fare of 2 $ the ride, where is the investment of the company on providing a good services, more buses, more bus drivers better service, better budget. I called and the Lady on the phone left me waiting on hold. I'll seek for an investigation in this situation. hopefully Public resources are being well managed, RIGHT? 占쏙",1
It's nice to still have some locations open 24 hours. And despite mobile park/pickup or the dining room being closed. The way in which the team here was able to expedite the dining room was amazing.,1
"There are two lanes of drive through. I ordered on the mobile app while waiting in line.  When I got to the speaker,  they didn't bother to ask my order,  or order number.  They just kept taking people from the other line. I know that sometimes happens,  they forget the order cars pull up. But not 4 in a row. As they started taking the 5th car,  I pulled into the line and went to the window.  Food was OK when I got it.  But waiting 30 minutes for that to happen in the drive through isn't cool.",1
It's McDonald's McDonald's. What can I say. We wanted a snack and we're hungry. So we drop by this place.,1
One of the fastest McDonald's I've been so far. I ordered through the app and it was ready in just a few minutes. The place is clean and staff is friendly.,1
Are food was great that is why we have got breakfast every morning at the same location # Bring The Bagels Back,1
"Food quality is good, cafe is very clean and all staffs are very friendly. Location is also very good. If u want you can order food through self-order screen inside the cafe, drive through is also available. Good for kids as well because there is a kids playing area inside the cafe.",1
Manager was great. He unlocked the door just before closing to take my order. I was staying at the hotel next-door so i didnt drive over.,1
"Went thru the drive thru. It was around 11:30 pm, and the line went all the way around the building but was moving. Only ordered 2 large decaf coffees. They were fresh - made to order.",1
This store is always clean. The staff always pleasant and helpful. I've been impressed with them the whole 7 months I've been here.,1
Excellent and fast service. The food was good.,1
"Typical McDonalds but extremely long waits due to proximity to tourist attractions.  Be prepared to wait 20+ mins in the drive thru, even for a mobile order",1
"Clean place with prompt, and accurate service. The chicken nuggets were delicious and crunchy!    We ordered through the Drive Thru with hardly any wait time.  The attendant confirmed our order no less than twice, and I was given exactly what we asked.

The inside is clean (as well as the bathrooms) and has a lot of seating.  There's also an indoor play area for the kiddos.  In this location you place your order on the touch screens in front of the cashiers.",1
This is by far the best McDonald's I have ever been too. They serve you your food very quickly and take your trash. They walk around asking if you need anything and are very friendly. Very clean as well.,1
"Quick food, pretty clean environment, cheap food. It's a McDonald's, they don't vary too much in general. Though there are outliers, this one is consistent with what I've come to expect of McDonald's.",1
"Very polite service. Very clean. One has the ability to self order. Playhouse for the little ones!

Thank you Ileanna for the great coroner service. Keep up the great work!!",1
"For a McDonalds I was pleased. Ordered at a kiosk, but they brought us our food to the table. Order was correct and food arrived quickly. Quite clean.",1
Very long wait time but the food was good and the young lady at the second window was so nice,1
Restaurant was clean and continually being cleaned...tables and floor..I liked this as it helps to keep the place looking well and controls the corona virus and other pathogens...food wad good,1
It's McDonald's. You know what you're getting. You know that every once in awhile and order is going to be messed up but if you walk in they're going to fix it for you and probably throw in a free French fry. There's no reason to give these service workers a hard time they're doing what they can. Thanks guys. Everyone once in awhile I want some chicken nuggies and and it's always you guys and your sweet and sour love sauce. Hot mustard is acceptable sometimes.,1
"Great food, service friendly and prompt,  restaurant very clean.",1
Employees are the make or break in the hospitality industry and Megan is the make of this restaurant!!!! Will return regularly just to say hi to her,1
Disney McDonalds let us down so we came to this one and the night crew knocked it out of the park. Great job.,1
"They always have consistent food, no matter which one you go to",1
Stopped in for fast coffee but instead had the pleasure of watching Angelica work her customer service magic. She took the time to rework a customers order to take advantage of saving. His way of ordering would have cost $14 but with her assistance it was just $8. A blessing for this customer as he is on standby for the birth of his third granddaughter. Doesn't matter if you are spending $1 or $100...good customer service is hard to find. Stop in and get your savings with Angelica should you be in the area. 占쏙,1
"This is a Great McDs the food is alway hot&fresh and they are all nice unlike my local McDs in Lex,Ky",1
"More often than not, there is something wrong with the order when it is delivered.
8/23/22 - order came out correctly today
1/28/23 - fries were fresh and hot,  burgers were cooked to order; staff was friendly.",1
"As a McDonald's goes it was great. Fries where hot, burger fresh and the pies where hot. My only complaint is that the opinions where very limited.",1
Unique McDonald's in that they request you use the touch screen order kiosks. I was hesitant at 1st but actually very convenient. You can choose one of the numbered tables you sit at and they bring your food to you. And Quick service the couple of times I did.,1
"Great for post Disney/Universal tourist dinner    Amazing quick service, fresh food, super easy self service option. I asked for no salt fries and no salt fresh fries is what I got. I was hangry after being denied service at Checkers (they were not accepting walk up orders at 9pm).",1
"My favorite mcdonals. Fast service, great customer service and good food error free",1
Great experience.  Fast service.  Accurate order.  This location has the dollar menu.  Clean restaurant.  Highly recommend this McDonald's.,1
Great fast service. They actually put lots of onions and pickles on their burgers here. LOL. S0 I actually started enjoying their hambergers more .,1

"Ordered our food through the kiosk, served with a smile and very courteous. Very clean location. Though one of the managers was having to deal with a former employee that was trying to make a scene when the employee was clearly in the wrong, the manager kept her calm and remained professional as to not allow the situation to affect those in the restaurant. Very nice experience and would come back again when I am in the area!",1
"Man this place is so awesome when I rolled up there was a line going all the way to the stop sign it only took me maybe 15 minutes to get my food which is not bad at all. My wife is pregnant and was really craving and ice cream fudge Sunday their ice cream machine was down. I had ice cream at home but no hot fudge ask them to give me a couple few squirts of it and they obliged even though they didn't have a button for it I'm really happy and so is my wife thank you very much. Very chill people, appreciate you!",1
Easy and fast drive through experience. 24/7 is always a plus,1
"Best McDonald's on planet earth. Our food was so hot and fresh. The best of the best for service, and preparation of food.",1
Food was really fresh and tasty.  Staff was very nice.  Huge line after parks closing but they cranked it out.,1
"Ordered food inside, first time back in two years. We come to Florida for vacation and the staff here is awesome.  In and out in minutes,  keep up the good work ",1
The servers and associates behind the counters are great. Things get fix fast and are always fresh no matter the rush.,1
This has got to be the best run McDonald's ever!,1
"Always worth coming to McD. The drive through was stabil quick, order was waiting for me, everything inside and no problem asking for more ketchup. The classics like big Mac like you would expect and good as always. Parking possibilities rigth in front of restaurant and drive in has even 2 lines. 5x",1
Great experience getting a late snack here tonight,1
Carmen the best she deserve a raise nice job,1
"This McDonald's usually ROCKS!
They can get thru a line that goes all the way to the highway in under 20 min.

Tonight,  there was no line. Also the inside was closed. AND...  THE ICE CREAM MACHINE WAS BROKEN/SHUT OFF. SHOCKER.

My son did something amazing at school and wanted a Sunday for a treat. So thats why we went.

Then they didn't put all the things we ordered in the bag and we drove off. 2 u turns in traffic and waiting in line now to get what they forgot.
So... I asked the manager if they could just add a small bag of fries since we had to do 2 uturns to get this item they forgot to put in the bag. She said No, we can't do that.
REALLY!?!?!?! I have worked in the food industry for 28 years.  I am well aware of what you can and can not do.
You didn't WANT TO. You didn't want to value me as a person, a customer,  or a future. You didn't want to do your job properly in the 1st place. You didn't want to apologize in any way shape or form.

I don't mind that a mistake was made. I do mind that they acted like it was my fault for ordering anything to begin with.

There are 22 other fast food locations in the quarter mile radius.",1
"The line was super long, but I guess that's what should be expected when you get off the airplane at night and it's the only place still open. Thank you, McDonald's! Despite the line the food was super good! The crispy chicken sandwich was shared hours later slightly heated in the microwave and still great! The McNuggets were even good 3 Days later according to my daughter :-)",1
Top of the line service. My husband and I came out from California to go to Disneyworld and the staff at this Mc Donald's was even more accommodating and friendly than Disney. The manager even came out to check on us. Just very impressed by how everything is running at this McDonald's.,1
They have the ordering kiosks here. It better to ,1
This location just recently allows you to dine in. But there are like 2 thirds of the seating unavailable.  The selfservice screen were not accepting card payments so you need to complete transactions at cashier anyways defeating the purpose of contactess ordering...,1
"Really great service at this McDonald's, manager Joseph was very helpful In getting my order placed with my over tired 3 year old.   Very friendly staff.  Food was hot and tasty but the staff makes this place stand out from the countless other McDonald's visits I have had.",1
Awesome customers service. So so nice is an understatement of the employees. Fell in love with Micky D again after having lunch here.,1
Good food and service!,1
I place mobile order at around 9:30pm and it was fast and no complains about my order.,1
We use the McDonald's app on our phones. They have the best deals for lunch. Most times they have if you buy one sandwich you get a second sandwich for $.29 They also have a large French fry for $1.00.,1
"The service is good and food is fresh , the only bad thing  is just that its always packed because is a tourist area.",1
Great Customer Service from the staff here.,1
"Best icecream ever , vanila cone",1
"This location has kiosk to place your orders only, similar to New York, then you wait for your number to be called to get your food. Staff was very busy, place was clean. Not super friendly.",1
This McDonald's uses a kiosk for inside food ordering. However if you have problems they will take your order personally. My meal was very good and fast.,1
The drive thru lane was fast.When I got the meal it was fresh  and  taste it good..But the only thing the orange juice was warm and the coffee they put their milk and sugar but it was no sweet enough.Also they forgot to give us ketchup.,1
The cleanest McDonald's I've ever visited. The staff was unusually helpful and attentive. The checked in with us twice in the dining area to make sure our food was satisfactory and offered to get beverage refills for us and to bus our table for us. Very well run establishment. A completely new fast food experience for my family. The food was good.,1
"I eat here once in a while when I'm in a rush or just need a good fish sandwich. Always good and fresh, never any issues with the drive though (which 99 times out of 100 is what I use). Good place for fast food. Drive through attendants are always quick and polite.",1
"Came here after a negative experience with another McDonald. Super friendly people, quick service, and wi",1
Clean location good staff thanks !,1
"Busy busy, the staff work hard all excellent customer service . Specially Megan.",1
Pretty decent but the machines you go to for ordering was usually broken. I'm pretty sure the ice cream machine was broken at one point because we couldn't order any ice cream related products. All along it was a decent experience and I would probably go back again if I'm ever in the area again.,1
"Excellent and fresh, hot, food.  The inside is spacious and clean. Friendly staff but I don't like the system where you have to order by yourself with the large touch pad, makes it hard to customize your order and confusing.  I'd rather just wait in line and have the attendants take my order like most McDonald's.  But at this McDonald's you must order at the touch pad by yourself.",1
"super yummy stuff round the clock. If you plan a visit after midnight on Friday, Saturday or Sunday; expect long lines and extended wait times at the drive thru. always have cash handy since they may lot be taking cards at certain locations during the early hours. bon appetit!",1

A good McDonalds to be fair.",1

"We came here twice during our visit to the area. The first day, I would have given them 5 stars; the service was fantastic and, despite being extremely busy, they gave great attention to each guest. The second time, however, we came through the drive through and the service was terrible. It was very early in the morning, there were only a few other cars in line (maybe 3 in front of us?) and we were in line for at least 15 minutes.",1
Employee was rude but it fine 占쏙,1
Kind of touch and go with this location. Sometimes they're very attentive and sometimes they don't listen when you're trying to give them your order. Late night is when I've generally had problems with their service. Otherwise they are pretty good.,1
"Always a favorite, McD's is still serving up all the favorites - we were there for breakfast and had a short wait. Alas, no dining room availability at this location for now. Very reasonable prices, of course, and some delicious NEW breakfast pastries!",1
Normally I would give this restaurant five stars but today service was really slow. I placed an order for two Egg McMuffins & a large french vanilla coffee. My wait time was approximately 10 minutes. I also believe on this particular day the restaurant was understaffed. Again usually this restaurant is a five-star McDonald's just not on this day.,1
"First time I had been to a McDonald's in America. It's certainly nothing special, but there isn't anything wrong with the location.

Food was fine and it was cool to try the different items from the menu. Also, yes, french fries taste the same whether you buy them from the UK or America.",1
"I will admit this was a first at this location as it is always so busy when I arrived there was a line almost out to the street and this is a double drive through was worried I would be there a while but only took about ten mins as they moved quick and to my surprise my fries were fresh and hot. Best fries I have had in a while. Also got a cheeseburger and I must admit I was also pleased as I hate it when I decide to actually eat 1,000 calories and my cheese is thrown in my hamburger and not even melted yucky. But all was right on this last time. Good cheez burg& 占쏙",1
"I love this place, I've been to this place for year's and not even one time a worker has been rude to me.",1
I visited this location during the morning rush. The store was clean and the staff was very punctual. My son and I received our food within 1 minute after ordering. This location looks as if it was recently updated and it includes a playland for the little ones. Based off of today's experience I would recommend this location to anyone visiting.,1
"Just stopped by my local McDonald's to pick up some breakfast items before going to work. The 78th Street Tampa Florida branch is always on their mark, quick efficient usually correct with my order of hot tasty food. I can't believe how much I've been eating at McDonald's the last 3 years after many many years of barely ever going there since I was a teenager in the 1970s. Food is definitely better than it used to be, and I love getting deals with their online phone app and food questionnaires for freebies from the receipts.",1
"The food is always on the meh side. Luke warm, never hot and fresh even when it's busy and the employees are typically miserable.",1
New interior looks great. This location has the new digital ordering computers. The food came quickly and the staff were helpful. Only downside was that one of the card readers was broken and it wasn't marked,1
"Excellent location with a large playground and plenty of seating for adults. The food is your typical McDonald's fare with nothing special to write about. They have a large parking lot, and the bathrooms were clean during my visit. My only recommendation would be for the managers and employees to meet up behind the restaurant or in the break room instead of right in front of one of the main doors of the restaurant. It made the place look like a corner store and cheapens the image of this brand. Their service was top notch and although they were packed during this visit the food came out fresh and without any delays.",1
"This McDonald's was excellent,  the staff was courteous and professional and although all I ordered was coffee, it was delicious just as I have come to expect from most of the McDonald's I have been to.

It is comforting to be able to expect consistency from a restaurant,  no matter where I go in America,  so far, there is a better than 90% chance that the coffee, for example,  will be the same thing I am use to and desire.",1
It can get tight getting inside when there's a delivery truck next to the store. Most especially when you're going towards the drive-thru 占쏙,1
The workers are pleasant and the food here is always hot and good.,1
"Quick service, accurate follow up",1
"They had a broken latte machine.  The kiosk already had our CC deposit.  It took very long to receive our CC refund because the manager had to perform the business, and the restaurant was overly crowded.  They used to make great cappuccinos, but it got to be too loud, and those machines broke more frequently than lattes'.",1
This is one of the busiest McDonald's I have ever seen. Very modern inside. Most people were getting food to go so there was plenty of room to sit but so many people waiting for food. At least it was very fresh!,1
40 chicken nuggets and 2 large fries for 15 bucks!! Also the ice tea is the best in Florida,1
"Food and service was good , but not enough  working personal",1
Great workers were very helpful. Eating area play area were clean. Men's bathroom was quite messy and the toilet paper holder was torn off the wall. Overall will come again.,1

Very clean and it taste as usual,1
It's a good place for fast food,1
"I frequent the drive thru here quite often and since their update the speed of service has increased.

Even though I am trying  to eat healthier these days I just can't stay away from my all time favorite Egg McMuffin. These ladies and gentleman are always fast and friendly  with a delicious sandwich.",1
The ice cream machine was actually working at this store. Drive thru speaker was hard to hear. No wait and quick service.,1
"Not from Florida..but every McDonald's I visited in this area was some of the best experiences you could ask for. Nice people. Fast fresh food. Super fun play areas, no complaints whatsoever.",1
Nice place to eat anytime you want. They are very busy. People come by the bus loads to eat hamburgers all over. It's a tourist trap. Cheap and hot food. Your money goes far. Most people go there for a quick meal and internet which is free.,1
Food was fine but line at drive thru was slow possibly because girl working window was more interested in texting then waiting on customers,1
The line for drive thru was out to the street! Not their fault it is not the first time. Once I got to pay point it was quick.,1
"If this is the location next to Old Town, I love it. My food was fresh and everybody read accommodating ",1

"This particular McDonalds across from Old Town, is a hit or miss and I went to try the new chicken strips as an entre with my #4 chicken sandwich meal.  Before I left the lot from the drive through I checked everything.... The strips needed more cook time ""my opinion"" so I brought them inside and made the request.... Now it's McDonald's... you should expect some kickback or something but to my surprise I was really shocked and amazed that the order lady took it, told the M.O.D. and he says he can take care of it, he just needed about 5mins I told him no problem and waited. Now when I did receive it, he made sure he gave it to me, and when I got home to my surprise added an extra strip! 4 of 5 stars because the chicken sandwich was very delicious and the service blew me away but the strips I just didn't like.",1
"Today Monday December 19 , 2016 This McDonald's Restaurant Has A Wonderful Services The Employees Name Is Miss Caprice & Very Happy & So Sweet & Very Helpful Food Is So Good The Morning Breakfast & The Hot Coffee & Ice Coffee Awesome The Big Breakfast Just Love It & They Have A Play Area For Your Kids To Run Around Fantastic Idea & Great Job McDonald's Restaurant Putting A Play Area For The Children To Play Around Perfect My 100% I Will Definitely Give You !!",1
We were visiting Orlando and I needed coffee. Service was fast. Staffs were friendly. The sausage biscuit taste like freezer. The coffee was good.,1
"Cleaness McDonald's, friendly attentive staff!",1
"Read down place has changed a lot! Getting to be excellent place to go!

Not good, new construction is nice. But understaffed. Even at 2-3am you can walk in and find over half of the tables covered with trays and garbage. Also the floors heavily littered. Yes you are supposed to buss your own table at a fast food restaurant, but alot of foreign/domestic vacationers are just filthy. They just drop food and wrappers everywhere. When they are done eating they just get up and leave.
Host/busser is needed for the dining area for the sloppy pigs. More register coverage for the guests. When a crowd of people have to go through one register while the kitchen staff waits for orders is inefficient.
I have had 2-3 errors in my 8 visits. First one was when they put extra mustard on burger instead of adding mayo. Second was they ran out of hot fudge and instead of telling me they used the coffee chocolate topping for my Sunday's (yes 2 of them).
I caught the first error quickly and was easily fixed properly by management before I left. The 2nd error wasn't caught till we where eating the Sunday's at home. I took one back as proof of the error to get a refund. At first they only wanted to refund one but with several minutes of bickering they refunded both. Yeah it was only $1 and some change but it was the principal.
I walk to and from the restaurant since I have no car it is about one mile away from my home. I always request 2 plastic bag's for my food because the one paper bag they put my 6-8 burgers fails halfway home. The 2nd one is for the 3 Sunday's.

Another epic failure, ordered 2 mcdouble no mustard and onions. 2 bacon mcdouble  and 2 mcdouble regular. Received the 2 mcdouble wo/mustard and onions no problem. 2 bacon mcdouble had no bacon and no mustard fail. 2 regular mcdouble had no mustard either fail. 2 large fries ordered and received 2 medium sized fries and 2 of the smallest sized fries I've ever seen (guess they where kids sized) fail. The 20 peice fry came without incident. Less than 1/2 of the whole order came correctly....
7/16
Getting better and better, the manager Monique she runs a tight ship. Every time I'm in and she is there every thing is smooth sailing. A great thank you for your great service Monique!
7/18
Wow place was packed! Was able to wait just a short time and got my order. Looked around and yep there she was Monique steadily coordinating the staff! Must of been 30+ people in line only 5 min wait. Later I saw her again in the lobby assisting a guest with her drinks, both with smile's on.",1
"This Mcdonald was very clean, the employee was so respectful I enjoyed eating here. The restroom was clean I actually allowed my little one use the restroom without worrying. The play house full of kids and very playful",1
I had an order that was wrong. I went back the next morning and the manager gladly fix the mistake he was very professional very kind and I love this McDonald's I eat here almost every morning. It is a very good location the managers are very professional and friendly and I highly recommend this McDonald's above almost any other I've been to,1
I've been at this location a couple times. Definitely a faster service compared with the ones i've visited so far. The lady at the drive thru seem like she actually cared so that's always a plus,1

I always go out of my way to go to this McDonald's they always make their french fries right well the way I like them the food is always hot service is always good looks like they're taking all covid precautions I recommend this one across from old Town,1

"One of the better McDonalds.  Fast, accurate, clean.",1
"I love McDonalds.  Been in my life all my life.  No bigger disappointment than waiting for my meal and getting lukewarm fries.  This one gave me lukewarm fries after I waited 15 minutes for my meal.  I hold McDonalds to a very high standard and, for me, the fries make the meal.  No exception!!",1
Breakfast was good and the meals were delivered to the window accurately.,1
"Very clean and well organized McDonald's.  McDonald's even has an indoor play area for kids, with a slide. I would highly recommend eating here on a rainy vacation day to allow your children a chance run off a little energy.",1
"I have an 8 year old lady, a 7 year old and a 3 year old. Mickey D's is apart of their life whether i like it or not, and its convenient. So chicken nugget me to death.",1
Service was fast but quality of food was disappointing on both trips,1
"Been to this location several times, only problem is the amount of time waiting for food for dining in & take out orders..... Always made food according to order.... Friendly staff, kind service. Kiosk could use work as the mcpick 2 is not on it and u will pay regular prices if not careful!!!! Otherwise, great!!!",1
This McDonald was very very good got me what I want and got it quickly I went to another McDonald's on South Orange Blossom Trail and it was a worst experience I've ever had I speak Spanish and you Spanish people that are absolutely racist and didn't want to even help me I don't know what the problem is but I don't think they should be working there what state was they were making saying nasty things about me in Spanish I understood what they said because I speak Spanish that you didn't know that,1
Food was fresh and hot and actually looked like a burger should definitely better better than what we get back home in GA,1

Very fast and efficient and the manager was very friendly despite the location being under construction.,1
"Keith was by far the best fast food employee I have ever come in contact with. He was so generous and helpful, truly deserves a promotion.",1
Nice food and nice play place,1
"Fast service, nice play area. Clean store. The manager was out cleaning tables and asking if we needed anything. Play area had some broken equipment, but overall it was one of the best experiences at McDonalds.",1
"An awesome McDonald's restaurant that serves food properly prepared,  quickly,  and at the appropriate temperature. This location has that McCafe remodel so it features comfortable niche seating,  charging ports for your tech, and other similar comforts that encourage you to stay and relax for a few minutes.",1
Amazing! The best McDonald's food I've ever had. Missing food I had to go back for but well worth it. The food made it okay. I didn't mind the inconvenience.,1

Not so much fast food but still good food.,1
Pretty cool place! Very busy as expected but they served pretty bb fast.,1
Delicious hamburgers that definitely weigh on your belly on your way to bed and if you want to take a quick nap on a full belly  McDonald's is the place to go,1
Fast friendly service at this location which appears to have been recently remodeled. Lots of senior citizens eating breakfast in the lobby which is usually a tipoff of high quality service.,1
They improved so much the Caramel Iced coffee and they have a sugar free vanilla Iced coffee low calories and tastes really good. Best prices too.,1
Good prices for large diet coke and ice cream cone.,1
It was very crowded but the service was fast and the food was fresh.,1
Only place open late on a week night so the wait time was extremely long.,1
"Great place to have a cup of coffee. If you are on the keto diet, McDonald's has whipped butter. Yes it's real butter. Along with half and half. You could ask for whipped cream. Believe me there coffee tastes much better with butter  and cream in it .  They do not have Stevia . They can make you a keto breakfast. Which is eggs bacon and sausage layered.",1
Fancy on the inside. Food was what you,1
They're not bad. So far I've never had them get an order wrong,1
For pure volume pretty darn efficient. Clean too all things considered.Use auto order screens. Faster. Didn't try drive thru,1
Very clean.  Attentive staff.  As always reliable and delicious food.,1

Good service and kind crew members. Always serve me with a smile (through the mask). Its a great start to my morning.,1

"Very nice McDonald's, it was clean and the employees are very polite and friendly. The play area for the kids is different than others I have seen & the menu was electronic, which was a little annoying being that I was in a bit of a rush.",1
Every time I go there it always a long line when you drive pass the window you see employees standing around talking and laughing. They need move a little faster.,1
This is a newer McDonald's with a very modern decor. Service was fast and friendly and the food was about what you would expect for a fast food restaurant. Overall positive experience.,1

Fast and good service,1
The fanciest and cleanest McDonald's I've ever been in.Professional and clean.If ours back home was like this one in Kissimmee I'd go there more,1
I love McDonald's I told my friends and family about McDonald's and they eat it everyday if addicted food I wish you can did olive oil to fry french fry.,1

Used the drive through.  All was good.,1
Same quality incredible quick service at this location I love it,1
Had a long wait in drive thru but customer service was okay,1
Stopped in for a liquid refreshment today due to the extremely hot weather. It was really delicious.,1
I didn't eat here.  O was with others who did.   They seemed to enjoy it very much.,1
Was able to get in and out without delay.  Cashier was friendly.,1
Great for a burger that taste the same around the world,1
Food was good but you never get the sauces you order on the touch screens,1
Nice staff. We went thru the drive thru,1
"It was awesome you got the food quickly, nice service and great atmosphere.",1

Most often just the same mc donalds,1
Very polite people and fast with getting food out.,1
Several ordering kiosks here. Service was quick.  Restrooms were clean.,1
$5 for 2 BigMacs need I say more plus $1 each including Refills for any Size Hot/Cold Drinks,1
"Another aspect that adds to the appeal of McDonald's is the affordability. The menu prices are generally budget-friendly, making it an attractive option for individuals or families looking for a quick and affordable meal. The availability of value meals and combo deals further enhances the value for money.",1
Love it!   When they know my grandson is there for his,1
"I went to this Mcdonld's before the gym.  They have a 2 lane drive through , but there is plenty of seating inside.  I ordered the spicy crispy chicken sandwich, the 10 piece nuggets, the fish sandwich and a large iced tea.  Overall the meal is good.  I wish Mcdonald's had more grilled chicken options.  But the meal is quick and cheap.  It got the job done for a good pre workout. The ordering process is kiosk here at this location, so you can wait in line or use the kiosk.  Overall good",1
"My fries were salted, they didn't put pickle on my Burger as asked, and it was a quick drive thru experience. I'd say not too bad",1
No problems or complaints whatsoever with this McDonald's in particular. The only thing  I'll say and I think is every single McDonald's same problem is  with the ice-cream machines.,1
"Very nice and helpful drive thru staff. They noticed a problem with my order before I did, and they fixed it.",1
Best McDonald! Great cust,1
This is a fine McDonald's. Clean and friendly staff and restaurant. Seems newly renovated but no kids play area. Outdoor seating is very pleasant.,1
I placed a mobile order to go before I picked up my granddaughter and her friend from middle school. They are always starving after school. Minnie brought my order to the car. I had ordered frozen coke but they didn't have it so she asked me what drink I'd prefer. She also told me to come by and ask for her and she would make it right for me.,1
There always fast and has my order ready,1
"The manager in the morning is awesome, the older Hispanic woman at the front counter gives exceptional customer service, you can tell she genuinely likes her job and is happy. Food was hot and fresh, and the coffee was just right. Will definitely come back to this one!",1
"I usually go to this location, mostly as drive thru. Never have a problem with food, service or wait. This last visit went with the family a group of 7. And order inside the lobby was clean, the staff was friendly. The gentleman that took our order failed to charge as a large meal so we got a medium and when an item in our order was missing Minerva quickly corrected the error. In addition Minerva walked around the lobby checking in on guests including us. That",1
"Typical McDonald's restaurant. Clean, relatively new facility with a friendly, well-trained staff. Ample parking available and very easy access/egress for both North and South bound Semoran Blvd/SR436.",1
The line on the drive through is very slow and long. So i decided to go inside. It is friday night. On the door states lobby open untill 12am. They have the doors locked and guys dancing and clowning around. One of them opens the door and tells me they can not take orders in the lobby that drive through is the only way. I asked him may i speak to the shift manager. So he went off and came with one of the guys. Not the manager. He said that the owner of the McDonald's closes early. I recommend people to go elsewhere and not here. Is not worth the time.,1
"With all the issues that almost every business is experiencing...major shortages of both food and employees.. McDonald's seems to be the only place that has managed to keep it all together and do things right! Employees at this location are always efficient, professional and pleasant.",1
"Went through the drive through, nothing to complain about. But you can tell that the people who work there do not want to be there. Too many fast food places in this area are like that though. Maybe if they got paid a livable wage they'd be happier. Maybe they deserve to be treated like human beings too? Yeah I think so!",1
"Joseph is a good employee they should give him a raise cause he told me how much 200 chicken nuggets are so that why he should get a raise.

P.S he was a good sport I di",1
"Good service Area is bot the best , but they are open late. Quick service and food is done in time,  ppl are pretty nice.",1
Today visit was awful. Food was stiff and luke warm and was missing some items  when I asked for it to be remade Joann the manger argue with me about it. I shouldnt have to argue to get hot food I paid for. Im back to update my review I originally gave my visit a 1 star. I got an email from Bre Williams the general manger she invited my family back and insured this is not how her store operates. Showing care for the customer goes along way. Thank Mrs. Williams for reaching out .,1
The workers were incredibly friendly and accommodating and the atmosphere was nice with cute little stools. The digital ordering was a little confusing but overall it was a lovely experience for a McDonald's. Food was good and it hit the spot ,1
For fast food this McDonald's is better then average. I think it is probably due to the staff. There is a young girl named Carissa on the Am shift who is excellent. She sees us come in the door and has started our coffee ( we always stop on the way to work). She runs around the restaurant ' topping' off your coffee . We always know when she is working the restaurant is neat and clean. Thanks Carissa for starting our day off with a smile,1
"Went through the drive thru a few days ago, had the car in front of me take the food I paid for, so they had to make my stuff again. I waited a little bit but got fresh food. I퐉 giving a 5 st",1
"My home Mcmunch always there to solve my cheeseburger deficiency. 436&1792
IYKYK",1
The first day the McRib came out I went inside purchased two of them to go to find out when I got home there was hardly too little barbecue sauce on it. So the next day I went to talk to the manager she was very polite and apologized and made it up I replacing the two MC ribs that were fantastic so thank you for making it right bump bump bump.,1
Wanted a quick bite so I picked up their 2 for $6 dollars mix and match items from their menu,1
"I'll ordered cappuccino but the machine was being cleaned. Ordered 2 sm coffee w cream on the side. Got coffee, cream already in it and not very hot. They had us pull frwd. When the came out, they gave us 2 med coffee w cream on the side.",1
"The MacDonald restaurants has served the best quality fast food for all ages for many years. For the last 20 years I have purchase the chicken nuggets and the consistency and flavor of the nuggets have not changed, they are just right all the time. Epifania, my 90 years old sister love the French Fry and the Grill Chicken Sandwich. Every time she has them she said  ""There is a whole chicken in this sandwich"" ""It is good for a lunch or dinner.""
Congratulation to McDonald!!",1
"In the morning this McDs is so fast, so friendly and always gets the order right. They don't add something I didn't ask for. The hash browns are always crisp and hot.  When I say light ice they comply.  Thanks morning crew.",1
I take advantage of the buy one get one breakfast sandwiches. Definitely worth saving your receipts!,1
The perfect example of what a McDonald's can be. Food was hot and fresh and made to perfect spec. Curbside pickup took under 3 minutes. Good work!,1
"Really like this McDonald's , it's got a double drive through which is nice , fast service and luckily haven't had any issues with their ice cream machine being down 占쏙",1
We just went through the drive through at the McDonald on 436 and 17-92. Once again it proves to be our favorite. Vonelle read back our order to make sure and had the ,1
This place is good for a quick bite but if going through drive through make sure to check order before leaving. They usually get something wrong or forget to put something in your order.,1
The food at this store is always done right. They seem to run a good kitchen. Things are served at the right temp and 99% of the time taste great. Unlike other stores where you've got about a 60% chance of great food.,1
Definitely very good service. I love the Christian music. Very nice and clean. Always love eating inside. I give a 10 star rating. Even higher than 10 as far as I'm concerned. ,1
"It's McDonald's not much to say.
Service was pretty fast.",1
"This McDonald's, is a McDonald's that we've been frequenting on Wednesdays, we go after dinner, for a little desert with a fairly large group, and we had an excellent experience with a cashier, very friendly and was quick to ensure we had everything we needed. I normally get the turtle brownie sundae, a very delicious treat.",1
"Employees were great, food was good",1
Fast and friendly they have no problem giving us extra mayonnaise and salt and pepper. My boyfriend mom always gets no salt because she can't have it and every time they make sure no salt,1
For a McDonald's this place is good.  The staff for the most part are friendly and helpful.  The parking lot and drive-through are well designed.  I also like the fact that this location is open 24 hours.,1
"Shamrock shakes are the best things in the world, I can't resist. I hate fast food but damn, I need these green frozen milk cups of joy. I'm certainly glad that they are not available for too long, I'd be 400 pounds! AND this McD's is open 24 hours a day, how evil!",1
Lines were long even at 7pm but food was hot at this location and they don't skim on the ice cream cones,1
"Cleanest McDonald's I've had the pleasure of stopping in, in a long time.  Friendly people, manager is on top of her game.  #impressed",1
Always fast when I'm there food is hot and always treat me with respect. I will be back and will tell everyone I know this is a great McDonald's.,1
"Stopped for nuggets and for once they were fresh. Usually, they're out of the cabinet and have been there well past the discard time, but that's the norm for most McDonalds.",1
Got someone else's order at curbside but im lovin it,1
"Clean, well cooked and prepared food, smiling employees, and modern interior. The nicest McDonald's I have been to in quite a while. Keep up the good work and thank you again.",1
"The staff was helpful and understanding. My McDonald's app doesn't work in drive-thru, the manager was very warm and helpful getting my order filled.",1

"Place is very clean, friendly. The food was ready very quick. Nice place workers very helpful and giving.",1

"This McDonald's looks like a McDonald's should. It's a good McDonald's. Great, even. Good food, too.

Built in 1989, this McDonald's is true McDonald's quality, whatever that is. Good service. Good-quality food. Clean interior. Modern on the inside, classy on the outside. Perfectly balanced, as McDonald's should be.",1

Great ,1
Free wifi,1
Nice  hot fast food,1
Great place.,1
For the size of the building and play facilities in this McDonald's it's the biggest and the best. If you're looking for customer service not a chance.  You're better off using the kiosks and have patience waiting for your order. I'll recommend this place for the experience only and works with your children.,1
Nice place for kids to grab quick fries! Close to Hilton Orlando. Just a walking distance if you need something. Next to them there,1
The manager at this store is absolutely outstanding . They just reintroduced the steak bagel and I said what can I change the bread to a McGriddle and she did that without a single question. I even went as far as to ask her if I have the round egg instead of the folded and she jumped right to it and that was fantastic. Try it sometime it's wonderful thank you very much and God bless.,1
I put in an order for in-store pickup but didn't realize that the dining room closed at 12. The store manager Emma and the rest of the staff were super accommodating and allowed us into the building and got us our food very quickly. Great customer service!,1
Ordered thru the app which was a quick and easy process. Mcflurry and shakes were broken and unavailable at the time of visit. Parked in curbside pickup as drive through line was long. Quickly and accurately received my order.,1
"Friendly, fast service.  Kiosks made it easy to place your order.  The food was delicious and hot.  Very busy location, but hardly no wait. The dining area was nice and clean.",1
Always friendly staff. Fairly clean and food to order. Shout out to all workers and managers!,1
We visited this while on a vacation to Orlando with our team. What an experience. There's a lot of different food options including PIZZA! The place is amazing. If you are ever in or near the Orlando area it is absolutely worth the time to stop in and see this place. Unbelievable.,1
"Great Mcdonalds! Really love the clean store, the big mac is delicious and so are the breakfast items and chicken nuggets. The convention is right here so there are a lot of tourists but they have a self serve kiosk that helps to speed up taking orders. Highly recommend this store if you're in the area. The service is nice and there are plenty of places to sit down to eat. Be careful leaving the parking lot though as international drive (the road) is pretty interesting at times. In conclusion, I rate this McDonald's 5/5 and I hope to be back soon to take out more food to do mukbangs.",1
Right place at the right time. It was a wonderful drive thru experience & right choice given those inside. Very busy in Orlando but food was fresh & exactly what I needed going back to Tampa!,1
Fast and friendly service. The food was hot and we ordered through the app which saved time. Customer service was amazing!,1
"Tried ordering at the drive thru but the manager that was helping the drive thru operator apparently is unaware of the current bogo $1 promotion.. told me I had to order 2 to get the promotion (?) so had to go inside and order thru the totens to be able to place my order including the promotion. Besides that, all clean, food was good and service inside was outstanding.",1
"Most interesting McDonald that I퐒e ever been. It features a fish tank, an arcade and serves pizza and pastas. Great place to visit as it is very unusual and interesting. However do avoid going there past 10:30pm as it go",1
"Good food good service and delivered quickly, I must admit I am a fan of the milkshakes and apple pie",1
The food was served fast but the time in the drive thru was very long. It is clean and friendly staff.,1
Cool place to visit. Workers were very rude and got multiple orders wrong while we were there.,1
Quick pop through the drive-thru for a cold drink after visiting Fun Spot. Frozen coke products are amazing and so was the cinnamon roll!,1
"When you're hungry, almost anything tastes good. Thankfully, their food was fully cooked, unlike other locations.",1
Food came out really fast and on point. Games were very affordable $5 for 30 min of play. Will definitely come back. Kids 6 and 9 loved the experience!,1
"This is the world's biggest McDonald's and has several options not available anywhere else, like oven bake pizza and pasta. Also, the dessert section has gelato and cakes",1
"Dream,this place was amazing,I mean the food was expensive but really good and the arcade had amazing games but unfortunately the prize room was closed cuz of COVID but this was a good experience",1
"Friendliest service I have ever experienced. The Coffee tastes great.

Could even use their phone for a car rental call since my car broke down.
Also it is very clean, during my waiting time of 4 hours they cleaned the tables several times.

I fully recommend to visit this place.",1
Quick and easy using the order yourself tower. Fish ole sandwich was delicious. Thank you.,1
The biggest Macdonald I ever saw! They are selling pizza as well,1
Nice stop after Disney World. I did like it better before they remodeled...,1
It was very loud and crowded with kids goofing off and yelling. Totally bad. Can't even eat inside around the after school time....,1
"It is a very nice place and the service is great, the taste of the food is different from other McDonald's in my opinion.",1
"This location offers pizza, pasta, and more. It has an arcade on the 2nd floor that acts as the play area. This McDonald's is the largest McDonald's and is close to both amusement parks. Therefore, it will always be a go-to stop for me on vacation. The pizza at McDonald's is freshly baked to perfection by a McPit Master",1
"Everything was great!  Food was good and fresh.  Place was clean.  All the employees were very nice to us and attentive.  Especially Patrick on the second floor, he was amazing.  Kept everything clean the whole time, ask us how we were a few time and was very kind and polite the whole time, and takes very seriously his duties.  Me and my kids enjoy our time a lot.",1
Little more expensive than your average McDonalds but I suppose that is to be expected due to the location. One nice benefit is that they do accept the coupons in the McDonald's app.,1
"This place was amazing!  Had fish tanks, it made pasta!  It was so quick, everyone was very friendly.  It had a whole upper level for kids to play, and was ao clean!!!",1
"Average mcdonalds. They get the order right 9 out of 10 times, which is a good success rate in my experience.",1
Who doesn love a Mcdonald had a late breakfast ie a big mac and massive coffee ou,1
We were looking for a certain happy meal toy to complete our collection and Emma was nice enough to help us and even search for it! It really made our night and she was awesome! Update: this is the 9814 International Dr location,1
The guy that works the window taking orders is hilarious and nice. I think his name is Sidel. He is an amazing person and made our night in the short encounters we had.,1
"Fairy fast service considering how busy this location was. Could have been a little cleaner. Food was good, but unfortunately certain items that are only available their menu were not available when we went. Large inside playground and has a arcade.",1
"Hello everyone.  First, I have to say that I have not been to McDonald's in forever!! With that being said,  I went through the drive thru because I didn't want to get out.  The young man who took my order was kind,  that was the first window.  2nd window,  a whole other story.  Drive up, and right off the bat, this young lady looks mad that she is even working.  You know,  at least fake that you are Blessed to even have a job.  I was scared to ask her for a cup holder, but I did any way,  lol.  I had the BigMac Meal and remember like I said I had not been in forever.... I DEVOURED THAT BIG MAC, it Was fresh, and so were the fries. I also had a Fish sandwich.  So yes I recommend.",1
"Excellent customer service, fresh food and juice. Recommend!",1
We went drive through this location and had a good experience.,1
"Great experience! The food was great but the real experience was the customer service. Destiny was super helpful and even overheard us talking about asking for extra syrup for the pancakes and went and got it for us without us even having to ask. Customer service sometimes seems like a thing of the past but not at this McDonald's. Also, when I spoke to the manager about the great experience he was very nice as well. Great McDonald's! All McDonald's should be modeled after this one. Thank you guys!!!",1
"The manager who i believes named chandler and one of the chashiers named Que where both amazing and made this experience unforgettable. If you퐎e looking for a 24 hour place to eat you found it! The food was great, quick ",1
Food hot and good. Excellent service.,1
Love the new ordering system. From using the easy to use order point to our food arriving it was less than 5 minutes. Only with we could get mcgriddles in the UK!,1
Celebrating my daughter 10th birthday by nearby hotel. Lunch was perfect with the game room/pla,1
"Our little one was having a pretty rough morning and Ms. Maria stepped in and went above and beyond to try to make her happy. Margot ended up smiling and dancing and even ended up passing out a few high fives! Ms. Maria made all of our days better. Thank you for bringing a smile to our faces. The location service was prompt, our order from the kiosk was accurate, and the food was well prepared. Clean location and restrooms at 10:00am on a Thursday.",1
"Had a pleasant trip here with my 5 year old. On vacation from Indiana and compared to any McDonald's there this is like a fine dining restaurant lol clean, food was fresh, tomatoes where not mushy which brings me to believe they actually don't freeze there's like back at home. Had two managers walking around the restaurant actually working instead of being in the backroom 'doing paperwork' five stars definitely will be returning before we go back home.",1
"My family and I stopped in here for a quick breakfast on our way home from a mini vacation.

I ordered the oatmeal and a hash brown.

An employee Nlnamed TJ brought our food to our table. I noticed I didn't have the apple chunks and raisins that come with the oatmeal. I let her know she went back and brought me what I needed.

I then noticed the hash brown I ordered wasn't on the tray either.
I let her know and she apologized, then comes back with not one but 2 hash browns, which oddly enough my young child decided after we got our food that she did want a hashbrown now. She comped a free hashbrown.
She was such a pleasant person to deal with.  Her customer service and customer care abilities are 20/10

I over heard he saying to another customer that this location isn't her usual location and she is a General Manager.

She took care of evryone around us, with an amazing attitude and a smile on her face, which is a rare occasion.

I hope she gets the recognition she deserves, and a promotion or raise. She turned a typically frustrating situation and made it a pleasant one. It's funny to think that I we left happy even though our order was messed up.",1
"Love their new chicken tenders, it's about time McD's start picking up their game!",1
"We stopped on the way home for a late night snack and drinks for our ride home.
Food as expected, friendly service, outside looked clean.",1
We only went through the drive through.,1
The employees were very nice!,1
"Good service, tucked away",1
Visiting from out of town. I was very impressed with the manager Stephanie. She really stood out to me today because she was working very hard and every customer that came her way she made sure she assisted them with out rushing them even though they were very busy. She also took the time to pick up in lobby to keep the inside looking good. Thanks for that experience today Step!,1
"Always call here after visiting Seaworld. It's half the price of the food in Seaworld. We order on the App before we leave, and it is brought to our vehicle 5 minutes after we arrive, nice and hot. My orders have been 100% accurate since using the App vs the drive through.",1
"Breana on the amusements kiosk has made our evening, giving her time to explain loading the amusement cards up, really kind and helpful and nothing was rushed or too much trouble, my children (5&2) really loved her and all the way home said how nice she was.

We've had bad experiences in this mcdonalds (long waits for happy meals etc) but i think she easily changed those for us today.
I hope she gets recognised for how good she's been.",1
"This place is amazing, clean place, nice employees and they have updated there technology. I",1
"The place immaculate, place your order at the kiosk, pick up a number and it was brought to your table. The attendant was very helpful and friendly.",1
Some of the negative reviews I'm seeing might be for other I-Drive locations. This one on the south end located near Sea World is always pretty good. It's a well run establishment and seems a little more upscale than the others in the area. Service is friendly although a bit on the slow side on my most recent visit but the Drive Thru was packed as this was on a Saturday night during a busy time of season in Orlando.,1
"Updated review 2022: This really is a great McDonald's. Maybe if you don't appreciate it, you haven't been around. The grounds are clean, I saw the manager (Chris) picking up trash around the store. They wear nice uniforms and there was an employee cleaning tables as soon as they were vacant. A very nice lady on morning shift was bringing orders TO THE TABLE ya'll. It was much busier at night so a longer wait but considering there are dozens of hotels nearby, I think service is pretty fast. (2019 Review) I went here three times during my stay in the area and the food was always hot, place clean and staff prompt and courteous. Got a fabulous greeting Memorial Day morning.",1
"It's a busy McDonald's in the morning based on its location, however, their service is good and fast. Great place to dine in.",1
Order was accurate and tasted great. Fast service. They were out of some items so had to change our order slightly.,1
"Ordered two plain fish sandwiches with no cheese or  tartar sauce, due to a dairy allergy. When I got to the pick up window - they had put slices of cheese in both sandwiches. I returned them and had to sit and wait for the order to be corrected.  Unfortunately, this happens constantly, no matter what McDonald's I go too. It's clear the prep team simply isn't paying attention to the instructions on the orders.",1
The manager here always is very accommodating and always makes sure that the place is clean.,1
Love this place,1
"Very modern McDonald's, plenty of self service kiosks, drive through is efficient and they even have a patio so you can eat outside. They also have table service!
Place was very clean too and the soda machine had dozens and dozens of combinations.",1
My family and i had come to Orlando for the weekend only so since Sunday morning we were ti head back to Miami. We wanted ti get ahead of the traffic so we decided that we would order breakfast and eat as we traveled and McDonald's was our spot. The lines were long but it moved pretty fast and we were happy. I dont get ti eat breakfast out very often so this was a treat for me ad the food was great.,1
Tgey forgot us at the curbside pickup. 30 mins,1
Friendly staff. Clean restaurant,1
They where A 1 they where closing & still let us come in & served us all & it was a lot of us & served us like we where they 1st customers & alllll food was hot ,1
"Visited a few days after Christmas, it was a quick walk from our  hotel. Considering the amount of people that were ordering, our food came out quick. They forgot some items and they were very apologetic and got the rest of our order right away.",1
Fries and nuggets were hot and fresh.  I got the family share about 40 nuggets 40 nuggets and 2 large fries. Plus the 20% off with mobile app. Great deal.,1
"We had breakfast this morning and was greeted by a manager in a suit who helped us place our order on the kiosk. Our hot fresh food was brought to our table by a friendly associate. While we ate I couldn help but notice a manager holding doors for customers and assisting where needed, even window washing. A male associate asked if he could take our tray when we were finished. The staff is impressive and the remodel looks refreshing",1
"McDonald's is my favorite restaurant of all. My dad or mom always order something we like. Mine is the double cheeseburger with no pickles. In Saturdays and mostly Fridays, we get those burgers for dinner. Like to see McDonald's keeping up the good work!",1
"Best McDonalds in the area. Great coffee, modern decor, clean. Wifi. Quickest service. Friendly and helpfull staff.",1
I personally haven't had any issues with this location. In the 2 years I've lived close by there have been 2 times where the drive through was majorly backed up and something was clearly wrong. But of maybe 100 trips in the last few years I've had 95% good service and fresh food.,1
They have a arcade and place to play for kids of all ages staff swerves you and very helpful definitely my go to place when In Florida,1
"This McDonalds is a sight to see!! If you퐎e in Orlando, take y",1
"The nicest workers I have ever met! The main lady, I didn catch her name, but she was so friendly and helped my family order on their touch screens and she was so nice and helpful.  It is refreshing to meet someon",1
Good hot food.  A bit of a wait for a McMuffin at 6:30am.  Nobody else in line at the drive thru.  They had to ask the chicken for more eggs?,1
We stopped at McDonald just for drinks. It seems they were low on ice and ,1
Had a slight issue ordering. Inform the manager that they're ordering system was not working right. They jumped on it right away to correct the problem with getting it involved. Super clean and friendly store.,1
"Very nice, clean establishment. The staff was efficient and worked diligently to provide for our every need. My family and I are visiting from out of town. We noticed that the employees, even the store manager walked throughout the restaurant checking on customers making sure they are enjoying their food. I greatly appreciate the atmosphere they provide for their customers.",1
"Busy, busy, busy.  Prepare for a wait!

Location is good. Restaurant is clean.  Employees are nice. Orders are accurate.  Ordering Keosks are cool.  Well laid out & up to date . . . but prepare to wait.  This place is busy beyond repair.  Drive through stacked (at least 9 cars waiting with both wait stalls full.  For the last hour, 8+ people lined up inside with 2 of the 4 kiosks in use.  Prepare for minimum 30 minutes inside.",1
Food was decent. Cashier had difficulties with card in drive thru saying machine was asking for pin. Odd. Large order but smoothies three quarters of way filled. Filled but looked like ice and concentrate added. They did remake it which turned out fine.,1
"Very clean, Inside and out. I order on my app and the food was waiting as I walked in. Everything was hot and fresh.",1
Good fast location. They had a third window for you to pull forward to keep the line moving through the drive thru instead of having someone walk out to your car. It was super convenient and it did seem to save time. We will probably stop by this location again before our trip it over. You can't really go wrong with $1 cheeseburgers.,1
"No wait in drive thru line. They got the order right. Fries were nice and hot and the staff was respectful. I did not five stars because the girl at the drive thru struggled to understand me, english was not her native language. She tried though and it all worked out. I got my correct order and in a timely manner.",1
"It is very clean inside, great staff. I always go inside and order take out. They do everything super fast.",1
The cleanest nicest McDonald's ever! The staff are so welcoming and helpful and great with the kids after a long tired day! Thank you.,1
We're here the other night about 2:00 a.m. they're very kind and considerate the fries were a little late so they offered me an extra set plus the ones that were not bad in my opinion but may have been a minute older so thanks to them and their service and tasty food,1
"Nothing bad to say here! We grabbed some quick breakfast before heading to the parks. We opted to use the digital checkout to place our order which is pretty cool and gives plenty of options to what you order. It also seems to give you a little more time to order. The place was very clean and modern in design. We didn't interact too much with staff but the little we did, they seemed very nice and helpful. Although not used this time by us, I did notice a cart specifically for sauces, seasonings, etc right behind the counter for quick access when asked.. the location was pretty good despite being off a busy road so that didny pose any issues. Overall a pretty food McDonalds experience!",1
"Very nice staff, good place to get all your fast food needs!  Tha k you!  ",1
They have better food than the regular McDonald's because it's the largest in the u.s.,1
"I don normally review McDonald but this is a good one because of the staff right now.  You know what the food is like so no need to discuss, you either like it or you don.  There is a very sweet older lady that works here that is phenominal.  She likes her job, is nice to customers and actually makes this place great.  I will be back.  Thi",1
"Very busy usually, fresh hot food, fried typically don't have salt on them have been multiple times before with the same issue. Prices also higher than other mcdonalds, otherwise clean, friendly employees, fresh food",1
"I love that you could touch screen order,  it was easy, and there are people constantly cleaning! I love that they bring the food to the table as well! Very nice, wish I had one where I love! I think more people would enjoy dining in at McDonald's now!",1
No heavy traffic which means your food is made fresh and rarely sitting for too long. Would recommend over McDonald's entertainment location further up international drive where the prices are significantly higher.,1
Middle of the day and they were fast efficient and friendly the fries were hot everything was fresh,1
"Only used thr drive through, but order was correct and the food was good.  Busy unit given its location, but the flow through the two lanes was pretty swift.

Interactions with staff were efficient and pleasant.",1
"I never thought I would rate a McDonald's as 5 stars but I did. Food was typical of a McDonald's but the staff were truly incredible for a fast food restaurant. They smiled, checked up on us, cleaned up our tables and looked far more professional than the normal locations.",1
This place was freaking unbelievable!  It has a elevator that takes you up to the game room where all the fun begins.  The food was good. I had the broccoli and  Alfredo. I do recommend it.  The large fish tank in the middle of the floor,1
The friendliest mcdonalds staff I have ever met! Tasha was the sweetest worker there! The food was good and as isially good price. They had some fancy new machines that had to be 2019 machines I was lost and couldn't get a refill cause it made me anxious and they were busy! But overall good time okay food good people,1
Really nice place. Best McDonalds I've ever seen. Milkshake was good too.,1
Totally not the staff's fault but there was only 1 person to take orders from the double drive thru. There were also a few minor mistakes on our order but considering they barely had staff I expected it.,1
"Fires were ""pie pan"" hot and the chicken sangwich was pretty deece. Better than usual.",1
"I have visited multiple McDonalds, and I have never received a great customer service like in this location, by the management.  Great customer service, great attention, very respectfully.
They even walk bu your table to ask if everything was ok.",1
"Busy, but the line went pretty fast, but had a mix up on the order.",1
After travel around the world this is one of the best McDonald's. The Manager is super kind and has the best customer service ever.,1
"I realize it's fast food but I like it and go there 2-3 times per month. I always get a #4 chicken sandwich meal. I get a large drink and total comes to about 10 bucks. Maybe a little high but the sandwich makes it worth it. International Drive location in Myrtle Beach, SC.",1
"Took me and my husband and kids there. They loved the playground that was located upstairs. It was very Spacey.
But just one problem was it not clean. Tables dirty and staff very unfriendly..
But will visit again
Here's pictures of the at home aftermath
#Wired",1
When i walked in i saw a nice line and thought oh no but they brought there A game that day they got everyone in and out! My order was correct and my ff were hot. The restaurant was clean and i got great service.,1
Very busy here at night maybe a good 20 mins to get u food,1
"Although McDonald's chain is known for it great customer service and fast delivery, however this outlet is different.
They are usually late in service even they are a very few customers.
Moreover, they have less no of options of eatables including snacks and beverages. Sometimes their machines do not work and customers have to wait to make payment.",1
Super friendly place! Yvette was our CSR today and she was very friendly and helpful.  Really clean too  which is surprising because it's been raining for hours.  Great location too!,1
So fun! The playground is HUGE! There also an arcade and shopping inside. My kids thought the elevator was neat to ride in a Mc,1
Good food. Good service.,1
I love this McDonald's.  It's across from Hilton Orlando.  They got good deals for breakfast and during the day.  The quality is amazing.... Way beyond what I expected.  The McCafe drinks were so good...not water down like those in NYC.  I am giving this place 5 stars if you want cheap meals that fill you up!!!,1
I loved your pepperoni pizza and California suhshi. Highly recommend this clinic.,1
I don't like self order machines,1
"Best Mcdonalds in FL, yet. Quick story, I came to order a quick meal because I missed a bus. Almost fell out and no one engaged me about it. Understandable. So I ordered a meal as well because it was well maintained inside-out. Looking for a good restaurant?! This location knows hospitality. Lol",1
"It's McDonald's, doesn't matter the city the food is all the same. 2 double cheeseburgers and a fry. Perfect lunch on the go.",1
"The McDonald experience is that you can find the same on every single establishment but what really makes a difference and makes you come back is the way the employees treat the customers, on this specific McDonals the manager (Timothy) makes such a good j",1
We went for breakfast before going to Aquatica. The service was fast and good. Everyone was nice and helpful and our food came out fast and hot. Everything you want when you come here!,1
They still serve pizza and pasta at this location. Plus a huge arcade with a prize counter to redeem tickets is upstairs.,1
"Very nice customer service! Helping, and making my family feel welcomed! Maria was the best help!",1
"Fantastic staff, manager and food. Far beyond any other Maccas I've been to",1
Went to this McDonald at 130 am,1
"Long lines here since it's in a tourist area, but the service was friendly and the food was hot. Just be prepared to wait in line for a while.",1
"The best McDonald's I've ever been to, hands down. My kids could play in the play area for hours. The made to order omelette, served to me at my table on a China plate, was delicious. The staff are overly gracious and professional. If you have been to Orlando and not stopped here you are missing out!",1
It was a little pricey. Just like eating in a real restaurant. $50 for a family of 4. But I'm sure it cheaper if you get normal meau things. We got noodles and pizza. It was plenty of food for the price.,1
"The single NICEST McDonald's I've ever been to!!  And that includes the location on the Disney property complex.  2 floors, massive play area for kids, full arcade, elevator, and the bring the food to you.  Glad to see the owners transform this place.  Well done!!",1
"Never ever had service like this in a maccies! Don't know if it was had a convention on next door, but was outstanding!",1
Probably the nicest McDonald's I've been too. Staff was super nice and really trying their best to make happy customer's and smiles. We even got to try free blueberry pies! (The pies were AWESOME!!),1
"So I never thought I would be reviewing a McDonald's,  because well its McDonalds.  However, I was in town for a conference and grabbed a quick lunch in between sessions.  The food was typical McDs, but every staff member was just so friendly and helpful.  Granted I dont eat at inside McDs often, but I have never been so delighted and cared for ar one.  Greeted as I walked in, ordered from kiosks, food delivered to me, staff member checked on how my food was and wished well by members as I left.  McDs needs to bottle up the service from this location and send to all.  Cheers.",1
"Clean, roomy and just a wonderful eatery!

The food was good and the staff was great. I usually dont eat at McDonalds due to the ones around my house being rather run down looking and dirty.

This was a pleasant surprise.",1
"Nice staff, quick service",1
"New kiosk-based ordering can be a little daunting at first.  But, it does seem to speed things up.  The food is what you've come to expect from McDonald's.  It didn't disappoint.",1
Good food,1
Late last minute 12am food run....McDonald's is pretty much the way to go lol.,1
"Best Mcdonalds I've ever been too. Way better then the ones in Alabama. They use a machine for ordering,  making customizing your burger easy. Pretty neat, pretty neat. If you like Mcdonald's you'll like this place.",1
Clean Restaurant and friendly staff. You can tell they are working hard to make sure your orders is perfect. Thx.,1
Had to order on the tablet screen. Then I was told to take a number to my table and it would be brought out. They never brought it out and I had to go ask for it at the counter 10 minutes later.,1
"They are the first McDonald's to get an order right the first time and not make you park. Food was hot and fresh! Cudos to this McDonald's! Anytime I visit, I'll be sure to go to this one.",1
"Everyone knows what to eat at Mc Donald's. The location is clean, fast service.",1
Biggest McDonald in America with an extended menu arcade and play area ! It is a Must go! .. just not now lol play area is currently closed due to COVID and arcade area needs a little tlc (a little wipe down on dust,1
Great place to go grab a meal!,1
Great place for kids and it has pizza...,1
They got it right! I order double quarter pounder all the time no cheese no bun everywhere I go . I never get that. It's always a debacle. This McDonald's got me! Thanks guys! Nice Manager too!,1
Sweet tea is amazing!!,1
Crowded... long waiting list...,1
the food was good but the pineapple smoothie did not taste like pineapple smoothie.  taste like ice only.,1
Great place to eat anytime. Affordable good quality. Couteous and fast service always. I really like the self service order,1
"Very good we had icecreem, it was good sitting area .",1
Clean place. They have cool machines so you can order yourself but I couldn't figure out how to use it which was surprising to me. It was faster to order at the counter with a cashier.,1
Food was oh so fresh I don't even eat mc Donald's,1
"Went in for breakfast on a Monday morning. Went inside, pretty empty. No line for drive thru. It's one of the new touch-screen style McDonald's, service was fast and easy.",1
Service is not good. They don't pay attention to orders. Give you wrong food. They need to slow it down a bit. It says fast food but give us the right food plz,1
The new and improved McDonald's catty corner the S Concourse of the convention center,1
You got to love the people who work at the McDonald's across from the convention center those people can get slammed at times and unbelievable Manner and they still handle their composure thank you for all your hard work,1
It's a fairly new McDonalds. I like the comfortable padded chairs for the 2 person tables if you eat in. Of course all the great hot food and serve yourself & free refills of drink. A great choice for a quick lunch!,1
Found it unwelcoming that food has to be paid at kiosk and no option for human interaction.,1
Busy but orders are right. Needs someone on the floor constantly to clean dining area customers are slobs here leaving trash everywhere. Tourist clean your shuff this is someone elses home!,1
Great overall but carefull with togo orders,1
"Clean, convenient, and efficient - only issue is that the member of staff that served me was very grumpy and really not very friendly at all. It was as if she was in a foul mood!",1
"Clean, modern and efficient service. Right next door to the hotel we stayed in so great for breakfast. One of the less touristy ones on I Drive and imo one of the best.",1
Same food but really good service!,1
This McDonalds is newly renovated with self ordering kiosk. This McDonalds also brings to food to you table for all dining guest thats someting you normally dont see at anyother McDonalds.  The only issue was seating the new furniture at this restaurant is not kid friendly the table is way shorter than other Mcdonalds my daughter was spilling food all over the floor.,1
They always seem pleasant.  When I use the drive up window they are really fast waiting on us.,1
Love the electronic ordering and the table service. It's nice to see that McDonald's is moving in that direction. I had a much better experience because of these amenities.,1
"Great food, very clean, received food quickly, staff was friendly to me. I saw staff engaged with customers and diligently cleaning their location.",1
"It's McDonalds. The food is consistent McDonalds, ordering is through the sel-serve kiosks or drive-through.",1
"It took more than 30 minutes to get the food, they had 3 girls at front including the manager. The manager was working so hard and even with angry customer she had a smile on her face. If I were her I couldn't do the job. I think they need more people like her.",1
I love the place. Plenty of food choices and the place is huge.,1
I love the cashier and the people working there there was this guy named Jose which helped me in the register and also threw my food away so I barely needed to do work and it was a great experience for my family next time we visit Orlando I will visit come again,1
"Confusing drive-thru lanes, but quick and friendly service despite long line wrapping the building and accurate orders.",1
Good food,1
This is a very nice McDonald's. It was clean and staff was very polite and helpful. They bring the order to your table if you are dining in.,1
Actually the Pilot gas station was built on this property as a addon. Just stopped here as a pit stop on the megabus to Atl Marta Center *Peachtree where they dropped us off at.,1
Clean restaurant and quick service,1
"Clean. Up to date technology, where shoppers can order from monitor. Associates were friendly and helpful. Good stop between meetings.",1
"I guess this has an extra added experience of a play area and and arcade to boost. But Micky Ds is always somewhere you know you can go anywhere in the world and find something you like, this one was slightly different as you could get pasta and pizza and all day breakfast option",1
Food is consistent with McDonalds.  New electronic order and table service and overeager employee makes it feel like they are owned by Chik-filet.  I like the old style service with counter ordering and FAST order filling.,1
Fast and friendly,1
Great store!,1
This a fantastic  McDonalds. I get coffee here several times a day. ALWAYS friendly.,1
"best breakfast in all of carolina forest, fast friendly and efficient

hot fresh food all the time and southern hospitality is free",1
I love how you can order ahead on the app and still go in the Drive-Thru and they start it right when you get there,1
Best McDonald's I've ever been too. Customize your favorite meals. Fresh delicious food and friendly staff who check in with your dinning experience. Much recommended to McDonald's lovers,1
Best ever,1
Be first in line but  I really like this McDonald's. You have to order at the machine kiosk thing then yeah it's legit definitely busy at certain times but fresh food though,1
As designed... This McDonald's was just like all the others! ,1
"Store still looks new!!! Nice area for the family with children!! Food was great, and service was outstanding!!! Thank you Kathy for taking care of my big order!!!!",1
Omg..Timothy is the best..He handle all orders very professional...He is a great leader..He was very polite..I just love his spirit. We definitely need more Timothy's...,1
Big maC,1
"Very nice and relaxed atmosphere, good food.. Seating outside is so nice and pretty.. Excellent experience, will go back..",1
Helpful staff and tasty food. Top McDonald's.,1
"Since this place has been remodeled, it looks fabulous, andI love the food. My favorite is the McDonald's Mc series. They are truly orginial foods. Sometimes you may get a person who is rude and messes up your order, but that rarely happens",1
"New Cashier kid was pretty lost and messed up our order completely, But the manager on duty was awesome and handled everything to make it right.",1
"I went to McDonald's and the service was friendly and brisk. We got our food and were amazed that after all these years, the food is still awful and our bag was missing a sandwich. The missing sandwich was the highlight of our meal",1
"Well organized, I came at a busy time on Saturday morning used, the ordering kiosk with a coupon to go, and left in 10 minutes.",1
This McDonald's is supposed to be the biggest in the world 2 floors with indoor climbing frame and games room the place itself is very spacious clean and tidy fast service friendly staff also provides a good selection of pasta salads and fruit for those non meat eaters,1
Very busy location but the costumer service was great. They brought us the food to our table which was great.,1
"This McDonald's did a great job with no contact mobile orders. Orders correct every time, speedy, and great service.",1
"I had a nearly $50 order with tons of customizations. They got it 100% right which is rare for a mcds.

Food was great and the family didn't throw
a fit because their food was incorrect. 占쏙",1
It was good for being buzzy employees actually brought your order to your table when it was ready it was really packed but well managed,1
"For fast food taste,  it's the same as every mcdonalds. But this location uses newer tech that allows you to put your order in with out talking to a person.",1
Love it very quick service very help people,1
Regular McDonald's but the point that you ban get pizza an pasta made it a bit more interesting,1
Largest Mcdonalds i have ever been in. I did not like the fact it was all automated,1
"Great, crew was funny and food was perfect. They never let me down and I'll continue coming here for this crew is amazing",1
"Everything  was cooked perfectly,  and the Service was very good!
We enjoyed our breakfast ",1
"Im pretty sure that this is still the largest McDonald's in the world. Three stories and a menu that rivals many other restaurants. Large selection of desrts and other foods as well. Its more like a "" theme"" restaurant. Pizza and pasta plus so much more with a McDonald's theme and of course the normal Mickey D's menu is included.",1
Very clean MacDonalds. Great grew. However MacDonalds needs to make french fries like they use to. They've lost their loving feeling on quality.,1
The food is good just like you expect from a Mcdonalds staff was nice and delivery was fast,1
"Fast ,fresh, great service...",1
New order and pay yourself stations and table top delivery services have snazzed up this Mickey Ds!,1
Bad customer service and nasty attitude got my order wrong and didnt want to gove my money back and cheated me out of my money,1
Not bad at all just crowded,1
This was the Orlando location by Aquatica.  Much better than NY locations in my opinion. Everything was fresh. Employees were super nice.,1
"It's McD's! I always stop in the drive thru for either of my favorites a quarter pounder meal, bisque egg and sausage meal or a mocha cappuccino! They're usually always busy, but fast.",1
"Best mcdonalds ive been to in a long time. Fast service, the good ketchup (some mcdonalds have that gross watery ketchup), and even BBQ sauce at the drink bar. Clean and polite staff. Im loving it! :)",1
One of the best interiors I found for any branch. Didn't actually try the service but would expect the same.,1
They seem to make an extra effort to get my order correct every time. Great location!,1
"In and out, very quick and professional service. They got my order right.",1
The staff working tonight (sept/2/22) were very nice. Reyna was very friendly and a tentative. Great service and team work.,1
"We'd been to this place and ate our lunch so many times; and the best things that I really liked the most are, the employees are friendly and the cleanliness is well implemented.",1
"I have wintered in NoVa for the past decade.  This McDonalds is the ONLY truly well-managed McD's in NoVa in my opinion (and I've tried 'em all!), the only one that at least acts like it actually WANTS customers to come inside!  Things they do that other McD's often do not. 1) free coffee refills 2) power for laptops 3) USB ports 4) bowl of McD's breath mints at counter 5) ample parking 6) friendly employees 7) CLEAN 8) updated 9) don't push the awful ordering kiosks (16 screen touches to order a coffee?! - please) 10) very pleasant dining room, lots of windows and sunny, and they clean the windows constantly 11) nice bathrooms w/ hot water 12) comfy padded seating.  I go out of my way daily to enjoy this McDonalds.  Well done!",1
Best service I've encounter around here.  Lots of room and they keep the place super clean.  Employees do a great job at keeping the place clean and customers are served quickly with a smile. Plenty power outlets and of room if you need a workstation. This is my new favorite McDonald's!,1
"ITS MCDONALDS! Average at best but still pretty good for fast food, CHILL WORKERS.",1
"only mcdanks around here that gets ur order right, gives you plentiful sauces, and never gives u half a large fry. always filled to the top. we like that",1
Service can be slow at times for drive thru but the staff are nice.,1
"When I was a little kid, McDonald's cheeseburgers were my comfort food. Grandma used to take me on play dates.At some point in time the burgers weren't so great anymore. Recently they started using better hamburger and it's like the good old days. Except now they carry your food out to you instead of waiting on the counter .",1
"Went through the drive-thru for a pair of the new caramel brownie McFlurrys. The toppings were place on top with no stirring, I assumed by it would be stirred. Still tasty, but difficult to self-stir in the car.",1
Nice and clean! We had to remind them of our order placed a while ago. I guess they were busy with the Drive-thru orders.,1
"I've frequented this McDonalds at least once a week for the last year. In times past, I was fairly ambivalent to it. It was just a place that I would go to get a quick bite to eat while I rushed off to some appointment or event.

But over the past few months, it has become so much more to me. I know the pleather seats like the back of my hand, I know the nuances of the quick-order kiosks, I chuckle every time I see that little piece of gum stuck on the side of the drive-thru wall, I know when the fries are being made fresh, I know and love that greasy sheen on the floor. It is comfortable, it is safe, it is home.",1
"Consistent deliciousness

Slap that egg on the table and touch your toes
Leave some grease on the table so the next person knows
Dont mistake me for a fast food slouch
I eat my mcdonalds on the couch",1
"This McDonalds is excellent, you always get out of here quick. The staff is always friendly, I honestly can't think of a bad experience I've had here.",1
"This McDonalds is amazing, it has 4 touch screens to order your self and customize your order any way you want...more tartar sauce? yes, please. with option to pay at that kiosk or at the cashier.
It has a hi top bar with 8 sits, maybe? each one with a power outlet with USB ports to charge on the fly.
Is well lit, nicely decorated, and the staff is friendly.",1
"This is a surprisingly nice McDee: clean, spacious and fast courteous service! There's drive-in with huge parking inside shopping center so never a problem finding a space. I am please to finally give a McDee a thumb up!",1
"Very clean, with friendly staff - food came out fast and fresh. Parking was easy, with plenty of seating.",1
Good customer service!,1
"It's a fast food place. It's fast and cheap food. If you're expecting anything else from a McDonald's, you're bound to be disappointed. That being said however, this McDonald's does its job well, and will not disappoint you. I have never gotten a wrong order, or bad food from this place, and you probably won't either.",1
Male Manager is a chill dude. Staff seem to have a healthy amount of friendly banter between themselves. Service was quick and efficient.,1
"The clerk quickly dropped what she was doing and took my order, then it only took a matter of seconds for it to get ready for me! In total I only spent about 60 seconds in there!",1
"I picked up a couple of Big Macs, fries and large Moca Frapes!  The food was good, hot and the drive through process very efficient.",1
Nice update McDonald. Customer servi,1
"As with all of the McDonald's that I have eaten in, the service was quick, friendly and the restaurant was clean.  The service to my table was efficient.  The restroom was also clean.",1
Friendly staff. Quick service. Great prices. Have gone often. Highly recommend,1
"Rocio is the best employe she is really nice ,caring and dynamic person I have met",1
"This McDonalds has been recently remodeled. It looks great, clean and modern inside and outside! It has electronic boards for self ordering.",1
"Out of the ~5 McDonald in a few square mile radius, this is by far the best of the bunch. Friendly, quick ",1
Super fast service but sometimes they mess up the order,1
Service is usually fast unless there s inexperienced cashier and there are 5 or more people waiting to put in orders.,1
"Nice, Clean, Exelent service.
This covid day Cleanness if what i look for the most.
BLESSINGS",1
It was a good McDonald's. This branch got the order right and the food was pretty hot.,1
Love the remodel!!  Order boards are great for most orders.  They do lack some substitution options.,1
Mc Cafe is easy and the best,1
Lots of booths next to windows. - frienly atmosphere.  They need to lose the TV - it's too loud and I have never seen anyone watching it.,1
The better McDonald's in the area. More clean and organized and gets order correct,1
It's McDonald's. We know what we are getting before we order.,1
"Good, but slow service. Location is clean, well maintained and has plenty of parking.",1
The cashier who took my order was very friendly and made sure everything was correct.,1
Very good service. Although they had no idea what a Mega-Mac was they hooked it up for me as instructed.,1
Great employee experiences with Brijot and before Caleb (I don't think he's there any more),1
"Good service good food but there is room for improvement ""I'm loving it""",1
Always a good place to go for a quick snack.,1
Great place to get a quick bite. Stand alone McDonalds very big lots of room.,1
I love McDonald's. Their fries are the best item on their menu period. Mic drop,1
Because there food is good and speed is good and thanks to my dad I went there,1
Ive been coming here for years now. The staff is very friendly and helpful.,1
Its been several time that casher don't order correctly,1

"Recently renovated, new machines and nice tables/cushioned seating",1
Cashier Sidel and drive thru associate were.customer friendly and kind!,1

Really enjoyed my breakfast  this morning ! Hot and fresh!! Not a long line at all. They were getting the orders in and out! I really appreciated the young lady at the counter. She made me a,1
"Since it re-opened, I go for breakfast about once a week. Literally have never had a better hashbrown at any McDonald's anywhere in the country -- its so perfectly crispy every time. My order has always been correct. The staff is super friendly and the wait is never long.",1
"Very, very, very slow service, shame on this store it took 12 minutes to cook a quarter pounder when on the paper only takes about 4 minutes if you use the press 2 1/2 minutes . I worked in Boulder city Nevada as an assistant Mgr. And we had 2 minutes to get one order out and 1 minute special orders so I don't get it, but... On the other hand visit there if you are not in a hurry otherwise don't even try it, because Fast Food Restaurant IS NOT!",1
We had a small birthday party for my 4 year old at the play place and they were more than accomadating. The area was clean and a worker came and helped us clean up after the fact without prompting. Super nice of them!,1
Loved this place...kids area was great....it was nice and cold inside...great after a hot day at the zoo...and food was ready fast even with our big order,1
The food would have been great if the tables weren't so nasty,1
Hey yo got that buy one get one for a buck. My 10 piece nuggets almost gone Bru.  Taking this Big Mac for a buck home Bru hahahahaha Psi-chopathicpeppamintpimpin,1
Fantastic theme which is inspired by Dallas zoo and compliments the same .  Spacious and also have a great kids play area.  Crew are good .must visit when visiting the near by zoo .  Kids will love it . A refreshing unique look than other mc Donald,1
I think I've always loved McDonald's and I really like what they have with the vanilla milkshake and I get to Becky McDonald's and sometimes in order of tater tots real good place real good food,1
"The man that takes the order is great, he been there for 10-12 years! He's great!",1
"I went inside with my kids and being that it's next to the zoo, the inside decor is made to look like we're at the zoo. My kids loved sitting at the table while we waited for our food.  The employees were friendly and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time. The restrooms were clean as well.  I recommend it. 占쏙",1
"I only buy 3 things from the menu...sausage muffin bundle and a sweet tea half sweet/half unsweetened.
They consistently make the best tea out of the 3-4 McDonald I frequent.",1
Its McDonalds... The place is remodelled. Gone are the Zoo themed life-sized animal replicas on thee inside. 占쏙,1
"It's a McDonald's with a Zoo twist. If you are reading this review, you likely already know how the food tastes and what is on the menu. The key difference here is the great animal decorations on the outside. More importantly though is how efficient this location is. Every time I've been through I've seen a drive through 10 cars deep and watched them churn through everyone's orders in a matter of minutes. If only every drive through was this efficient.",1
I am changing my review from 1 star to 5 stars after my recent two visits (Mar. 2023). This McDonald's has gone through a major overhaul. Newly remodeled inside and out including employees.  Employees are very polite and welcoming even asked how my day was going and talked about the weather. ,1
McDonald,1
They had my food very fresh,1
"It's a macdonals.. so food is alright. It was clean and loved the jungle decor thats a nice touch. Only thing was the baby changing station the table opened outwards instead of longways like a regular one, and it was leaning toward. And with my 2o month old it was just a slide.",1
The young man wearing the black mask that said king on it taking orders today (12/5/21) during lunch was absolutely awesome !!  His Customer service was on point and he was extremely pleasant !  The food was correct all across the board and we couldnt have left any happier. He needs some sort of recognition for an awesome job well done ! He made the rest of the store look good today.,1
The Lady was a little rude over the speaker but face to face she was nice so I gave her a compliment regarding her hair.  But my order was right everything was not except the cinnamon roll that's why I only gave them 4 stars please warm up the cinnamon rolls,1
"The employees,& staff,were friendly, and polite.",1
"Order was correct, but drive thru took long",1
"I didn't eat here but stopped to use the restroom on the way to DFW.   It seemed clean overall.  I enjoyed the jungle theme.  It was inmersive,  right down to ""Lions"" and ""Lionesses"" on the bathroom doors!  Somewhat of a weird location just off the freeway exit, lots of construction in the area when we stopped by.",1
Was blown away fast and fresh food was little bummed they took animals out,1
Great people fast not mess up your order real pros to. The manager asked if my order was right! He's was great nice polite and friendly.,1
Food is always fresh and hot.,1
"The service was good. The young girl assisting me was polite.
Their playground is huge, and air conditioned. And its decorated nicely. We liked the tables with animals on them!!
My kids have been begging to come in here. They loved it.",1
Fast food drive through service was quick and courteous. Great! Dine-in was not available yet. I am looking forward to seeing the inside. Fun animal theme would be fun to enjoy with the kids after a day at the zoo.,1
They actually have a play area which most McDonald's don't anymore.  We also loved the animals inside and outside,1
"New staff provide a fresh experience. The food is always fresh and in it's proportioned correctness. A large french fry will have more fries than a medium size. Imagine that. "" I am loving it"".",1
The best looking McDonald's I have ever visited. Located near the zoo. Friendly staff and fast service.,1
"Was good service, would've been better if we wasn't walking around a homeless person passed out on the sidewalk was strange for sure",1
Friendly management and staff. Ready to make sure you are satisfied with your order.,1
Cute place to bring the kids. Never seen a McDonalds like this one,1
The employees were very friendly. Our order was correct. The food was hot and fresh. The tables were clean. My kids were happy.  Thanks for a great lunch!,1
Love the French fries. The coffee drinks are great! Excellent place for small children. They do have healthy good for the kiddos. Fun place to play. Many treasured memories with my little grandson. (He's 20 now!),1
My kids love going to this McDonald!!! It a zoo McDonald,1
Super friendly staff which is so different when it comes to Mc Donald staff. Every time I go there they seem so happy to be at work and serve. So refreshing. Plus the morning staff manager is so on point and the staff really reflect them well.,1
"It would be nice if the play place was open again but it's not so that was disappointing. It's clean, employees are nice, got my order right.",1
"I went there this afternoon with my almost 3 year old. The food was fast, made right the first time and was good. The staff was wonderful and the restaurant was clean and the animals were amazing. I could not compliment this place anymore. If we lived here we would go here a lot.",1
"Although they kept forgetting stuff,the ladies were nice and quick with our food. Super upbeat,love the environment!",1
Food was good and fresh,1
Had a great time the  family here .  Very friendly environment  and the food qas great,1
"I haven't been to McDonald's in years and I was surprised how good it was. I have the southwest salad and it was great. I don't know if I would go back for another few years, but I was pleasantly surprised. Also the staff here was super sweet with my little girl to ask to trade in her toy from her happy meal.",1
"Hot fresh fries and the frosty machine is up and working  after 9 pm? I know, it's unheard of right? Well I had a really great experience at this location. Staff was professional and pleasant and the food is yum!
Thank you everyone.",1
Very fast friendly service,1
"This is an American classic serving up hot and fresh fast food favorites. I like this location because the people are always nice, and the service is always fast. This is really good if you have a short lunch break and need to make the most of your time.",1
"This was a good McD. They made a good product that wasn't smashed in a bag and thrown out the window. They actually salted the fries, that's a lost art anymore. And the girl at the window was sweet and full of smiles. Obviously a happy crew does better work.",1
I퐒e used the drive through only. Service is great. I love the outd,1
I like coming to this location the morning team is always kind & friendly...the night team has more younger team members some of them have great customer service..but the only thing that stopped me from rating 5 stars the point system I've had trouble several times adding my code to gain point for my purchase ...and reached out to McDonald's customer service and was told someone would contact me but that hasn't happened ,1
"This is a wonderful wildlife themed location right next to the Dallas Zoo and perfect for bringing children for lunch before heading off to the zoo. The staff is always friendly here, the management is good and the restaurant is much cleaner and well run than most McDonald's in the area. Prices are typical of the food chain, service is fast and the food is usually above average for fast food. Can't go wrong here, especially with the kids. They will love it.",1
"Very nice fancy ""CLEAN"" restrooms, that's a plus! Very clean lobby area and nice play area for children, just no hooks on the restroom doors to hang our coat, jacket or purse. Overall it's a well managed McDonald's compared to others I seen. :) A-1 rating I also love the Dallas Zoo theme! It's a tourist attraction. Thank you McDonald's for your professionalism in management and customer service. (Please put restroom door hooks up for our coat, jacket, diaper bag and/or purse, thanks!)",1
"I rate this place five stars cuz these guys do deserve it, the food was hot fresh and exciting still to this day! And yes I knw we all ate pretty much everything @ McDonald's, but these guys put there love into cause still to this day, I want another one... And no one has made my hamburger like you guys, and I really appreciate that. Thank you McDonald's, I'll be back! And shout out to the manager who helped me and my family that day. Thank you!",1
"McDonald's is McDonald's. Consistent menu/ food quality. What sepates this location from other's is decor and friendly staff that do a great job with order taking, getting it out quickly and keeping area clean. Besides the large play structure this location is an extension of the zoo experience with  models of a giraffe nibbling leaves from a tree containing a huge snake, a  touchable cheetah statue and chatterbox chimp. Great place to go with kids.",1
Well its very clean with good food.i recomend the number 6 mcgriddle,1
Good food nice place,1
I'm guessing that this location is a training hub or something. It seems like it's always some kind of trouble when it comes to order food show code on app for food pay and go. Sheesh ,1
"Hey guys,  want a quick little pick me up for brunch? Order an apple pie , wait till you get home to heat it. Spread a little butter on it, pop it in microwave  for seconds . Top with  ice cream...don't for get coffee!...now that's a nice little something,  for a little bit of nothing...all at the Mac..",1
Passing through from a volleyball tournament.   Great tasting food with friendly service.  Had bagel nice and hot with fresh hashbrowns.  Definitely recommend if hungry and needing to feed a family fast on budget.,1
"Awesome, super nice staff!! We stopped by every Mc to get the BTS meal. Only this place has the special paper bag!! Even the BTS pic!!! Thank you so much.",1
I liked it cause its right by the zoo and my daughter loves to play but the staff there can be a bit abrasive after a zoo event like the Halloween trick or treat event they we understaffed and ran out of a flavor of soda and large drinks and I payed for a large but only got a medium they should have just made the fries large but the guy running the register seemed kinda new,1
"I love going to this McDonalds by the Dallas Zoo cause they have these animals that make noise and look like a jungle in there. Today we were there around 7pm and the cashier and the manager were so nice to us and they even talked to my kids and made sure that we got everything we asked for. The only thing I didn't like was that for the happy meals for my kids they got the same toy and it was a girl toy, I have a girl and a boy so my son got a girl toy. I know why McDonald's do this but it's not the employees fault.",1
A couple years ago at 5 am I went here pregnant and got an egg mcmuffin when i got home to eat it and go to bed it was dripping with grease. Today i ordered a 20piece chicken nuggets and 3 large fries they were all served fresh and i only waited a few minutes.,1
"Stopped in late around 1am but received good service, area  around drive thru was clean despite age of building and outdated signage for the play place but received order and the team member even placed an extra sauce I requested at the window in a separate bag instead of trying to shove 5 in my hand like most do.",1
"Neatest McDonald's I've ever been to (except maybe one in Roswell, NM), the jungle zoo theme is awesome. Food was good, service was great. Even gave us a free drink, very kind.",1
"I buy my drinks there. The Management staff there does not have a problem giving me honey with my coffee. The Managers and their staff are always asking their patrons is everything ok and will address small problems with a smile , even the homeless. Not like the rude manager that I have reported twice on (Robert B Cullom 75215 in South dallas) and I never heared anything back from McDonald about that !!!! As she stated they are only going to redirect you back to me . Since I haven't heard anything back Im going on Social Media about that manager in the South Dallas McDonald's",1
If you like a lively staff who can make you smile and have a good laugh this is the McDonald for you.  They were very pleasant and funny.,1
Fancy Mcdonalds.  Zoo theme nice.  Everybody friendly. Had a hard working young man named Nathan.  He was doing everything. Working hard.  All over the restaurant.  Just wanted to let him know somebody noticed.,1
Busy place but the people who served us were friendly and polite. More expensive than other McDonald's I visit. I am guessing this is because it is near the Dallas Zoo.,1
Very unique McDonald's. They have all sorts of animal statues around that make random noises while you eat. The play place is unique and the outside of the place has so many cool photo opportunities. The food is typical McDonald's.,1
The tiger  was out and ,1
"Very nice place, it is decorated as Zoo kind of theme inside, Kids love to dine-in",1
"It's the perfect place to finish a long day at the Dallas Zoo. This animal themed McDonald's has a very large play ground area and plenty of tables and seats to watch the kids while they play. The food and service was adequate although the bathroom could have been a a little cleaner. All in all, it's different enough and the kids liked it enough that we will likely come back after our next visit to the Dallas Zoo.",1
Great food great staff....I stop there several times each week for breakfast and the food always arrives fast/ fresh/delicious and the staff always remembers me. Highly Highly Recommend this location!,1
My 3yo granddaughter loved this place. The play land is well designed with plenty of room for active exercise and the larger than life zoo animal motif delighted her.,1
Wonderful place especially for kids... The staff is friendly and helpful. The food is always fresh and the location is clean. Wonderful to eat inside especially after a visit at the zoo...,1
No matter how many cars are in line they get you through pretty fast. when I got to the window I wanted to get an extra order of fries and they told me they couldn't sell them to me.,1
"I only eat breakfast here now, but when I get my hot caramel, its a hit or miss. Sometimes its perfect, days taste like dirty water but they will correct it.",1
Even though my receipt was two days ago they still have me what I was missing out of my order instead of declining,1
"McDonalds is great! It is a sure thing. You know you what to expect. Today I was surprised! A new burger caught my eye. It is a Spain inspired burger. I was hesitant about buy in it. This was new and well it could be great or ruin my lunch BUT I took a chance aaand!!! Oh my goodness!!! It was sooooooooo yummy! I mean it was so yummy that I hardly touched my delicious fries! Well, my normal favorite is the quarter pounder with cheese .... today it was that Spain inspired burger. I guess it was the cheese or the sauce(normally I don't like sauces on my burger) but I don't know if it was the combination of bacon, the different cheeses or what, but it was soooo good. Yum I will have to come back to this McDonalds. I don't think they sell this burger in just any McDonalds, I think it has to be in one of the safari themed ones. Anyway it was really good! It made my day! I was happy the rest of my meetings and sessions. Normally it would be boring but hey my tummy was cheerful and so was I.",1
I frequently visit this McDonald's and I'm never disappointed which I know isn't saying alot but these days normal as advertised service is a hard to come by thing.,1
I had to get out of the rain and service was really quick.,1
Had great service last night fast and friendly with fresh food,1
The ice cream is the best. But the Hamburgs are to small and the frys the make are the best as long as there Hot,1
They are really good people that work at this McDonald's they go out of their way to help. The place is very clean and we'll run,1
The people work there very friendly. Simply i love it,1

Everything was good during oiut visit.   The staff was friendly and the service was prompt.    The food was hot and fresh.  This is where we go after our visits to the Dallas Zoo!,1
"gregory is amazing & this place has good

Excellent customer service and well prepared food.  Drive-thru staff were professional and friendly. I even had eye contact and a smile!  This is how it's done!,1
Pretty awesome and reasonably priced  too really like the any size drink for a dollar.Reminded me a lot like (Chi) town' own very well liked & famous for the best hamburger by far south side White Castles hamburgers,1

I received my order as ordered,1
Apart from restroom being to cold on a cold day the place looks nice. Awesome animal displays.,1
"order was wrong, but staff made it right and free burgers and fries",1
Son loved his happy meal this is the zoo McDonald's it is great it has fake animals and animal pictures everywhere,1
Best McDonald's in Dallas! Great way to continue the zoo fun after walking around the Dallas Zoo all day. Kids always have a blast in the clean play area.,1
Their customer service was better then most McDonald's here in the dallas area. Very clean and the floor plans is like the zoo alot of animals trees .... Loved it,1
They were remodeling it and only the drive through was open. Line went fast and food was nice and hot.,1
Food was hot! Still got homeless people begging for money not for food. And why are not the staff wearing gloves handling the food back there.?,1
"Fast, fresh hot food, staff is friendly.",1
Would be slightly better if they paid more attention when you order. Still pretty ok if you like the sounds of the zoo to follow you to lunch.,1
There is a new zoo animal added to the front can you guess what it is....the service was gr8 and not a long wait!,1
Took a very long time to get our mobile order but our order was correct. Which was great.,1
Mgr used great CS skills after another customer recieved my order. She was awesome under pressure..,1
The service was outstanding and I enjoyed being there.,1
"All order was correct and made quickly. Ordered #4 chicken sandwich.   Fries were burned.

Staff friendly- busy stop.",1
The phone still taste good but the services gotten pretty slow I love all the inside playgrounds for the kids on these hot days,1

"Very good, pretty punctual, there's some issue with the ordering, ordering screen, and the timing of all of that.",1
I haven't been a McDonald's fan in a while but every time I come here the food is perfect!,1
"I love this place..a great place to bring kids...n if u r in a hurry its the best place to stop,trust u wont be there long",1
Noise of animals is scary. There should be warnings.. aside from the cheetah print booth seat decal. Beware.,1
Just look at the design and those huge inside playground! You can order latte and apple slices and forgot about kids for half hour:),1
"Good place to eat at if you're on the go! I like the sausage & biscuit w/egg,and it's good.",1

"Fast service Even tho lines be long at night service is quickly, I rarely heard them say they are out of any products like most do at night I have not yet tried an hot or cold coffee at night there, hopefully the machines still works since thru are on a very busy and tourist spot, very safe to go to at night.",1
Restaurant was clean. Ordering at a kiosk was pretty impersonal but the cashier was nice. I didn't like my breakfast choice - it looked like an english muffin with sausage. But the muffin was very soft and tasted like syrup. Yuck. My sweet tea was weak at best. However everyone else with me enjoyed their meal. Bathroom was clean too.,1
"truly one of the web services of all time. my favorite part was when they said ""it's Roblox.Amazon.Core'in time"" and Roblox.Amazon.Core'd all over the place!",1
Excellent customer service and my food was hot.,1
Went thru drive thru and food was served fast and correct.,1
"That Donald's tho'...

The burger bun should be less white bread and saw dust  and more craggy , textured with a slight bite",1
Drive thru was quick and professional considering we had a order of 10 meals early in the morning,1
Fairly clean majority of the time. I guess that depends on who's working. But the customer service is pretty fair in all my experiences here. For a quick bite. I prefer this specific McDonald's. Food is always fresh. And I never have to ask for napkins.,1
It's a very nice renewed place. It's a shame that some homeless sleep inside the restaurant,1
Can get busy.  You can't miss it.  Parking is pretty tight but depending on the time of day you can find a spot. The staff have great customer service. The environment is clean.,1
Here you can order from a big touch screen and they bring the food to your table. It's also possible to order in advance through the app and they bring you order to your car.,1
"everybody screams on their own table. It's not employees fault,but environment terrible.",1
"No matter how healthy you normally eat, Mickey D's fries are perfect after a long fun night out! The drive through attendant yesterday (03/06/22) was pleasant and even gave me a water cup and mini kid size fries for my dog.",1

Today I had a little hick up with my order and Paola took care of it right away which felt like a regular day as I come by the drive thru. Thank you Maria and Paola you guys rock!,1
"For a fast lunch on the go, try a ",1
Looks like they renovated since I last went - person taking order was pleasant despite heavy orders - bit of a wait in drive through because of number of cars,1
"Love frappes at this location. Sometimes there is not good service, I think is due to covid. We have to wait until the situation gets better with a full staff so I can give a more objective review.",1
Oh yes Love Mc Donald's sense little however I am Bother by The San Andreas Fault-line Going To Separate Not Enough Sewers To Drain The Ocean Water Of It Done might create a Domino AffectThe Great Wall of America The San Andreas Fault-line Emergency Plan SCUBA GEAR BEFORE THE SAM ANDREAS FAULT-LINE SEPARATE CASH APP GODHEADDIVA,1
"When your hungry,it's the place to go!",1
"Be sure to keep eye contact with who takes your order, otherwise with the slew of Uber eats orders coming in by the second, your order can easily become either relegated or dropped in priority. Craving ice cream? Ask them to make it last in your order, for if you're waiting, you might as well have ordered a milkshake being it will be pretty molten. Overall, the staff have changed for the better, and their service continues to get better and better.",1
Solid dive bar with good food. The chilli is excellent. I had a salad which was decent too. You can smoke inside which is a rarity these days. Nice staff who are attentive and friendly in doing so. It's in an odd location for sure.,1
Good staff and good service,1
Overall a decent McDonald's. Clean and fast.,1
Wonderful people here thank you.,1
"The service at this McDonald on NW 36th Street and 22 Avenue is amazing!

I came in before my shift at City of Miami Parking Enforcement Department and had my breakfast.

I had two delicious and hot burritos and a Diet coke. There coke system is second to none always on point. The staff is friendly and ready to help yo",1
"This is what I call one of those 50/50 places. the food quality is always good, it's the people inside, specifically sometimes you have homeless sitting at a table, or a very loud bunch of drunk adults ( kids I don't mind, that's what they are suppose to do). there is nothing they can do, but I still get my order and eat at my scooter outside. not fun but what can you do.",1
Very clean and friendly employees,1
This is a very friendly restaurant.  Even when they are busy they seem to find a way to smile. Some do need to check their attitude at the door but for the most part they are usually very accommodating and service is typically good.,1
"Night shift, Huge improvement since my last visit. Very organized and clean. Management controlling everything. It looks under new management. I like the new service of taking your food to your table.",1
"The fresh coffee is good! Only 99 cents, you can not beat that! A lot of freebies if you download the app! Paola,  the assistant manager,  is cute and friendly!",1
Long wait but after order it was fast.,1
Great service,1
"The food and service is great, the staff is well-trained and they never argue with the guess. They work out at an alarming fast pace. Good brand to work.",1
"Two drive thru lanes for faster ordering, plus open late. Great chocolate shakes! Thanks again! 12:29 am Saturday, May 12, 2018",1
"I enjoy eating here very much. It's probably my favorite McDonald's because of thier excellent customer service. The staff is efficient, the dinning area is clean, management has thier game face on, and the food is just right.",1
McDonald's is cool with me big breakfast is always really good McChicken sandwich and maybe a quarter pounder or two other than that yeah it's McDonald's,1
I ate he a r at least 5 times since I was in Miami and I never eat from this chain as I got older and more wiser.,1
McDonald's is McDonald's. This place is good for the Children & the young peoples not for a old guy like me. I just went there to buy a black coffee.,1
Well managed and the food is good. Take it from an ex McDonald's employee,1
"Always check your bag before leaving, moderate defect rate",1
I origin gave a bad review because they were a bit slow but I had to give them five stars for not allowing themselves to be punked by the Miami police officers who think there entitled to a police discount.  Ahahahahahah,1
"I'll spare the typical McDonald's speech about how it's bad for you blablabla . . . Since I moved to Edgewater, it's been the most reliable source for an ""actual"" late nite craving. Past midnight, it'll fulfill your sugary/salty cravings whatever the time is. Absolutely love it. 100% reliable.",1
Food was delicious....I always get the big mack and fries and ask for it to be HOT ,1
"Newly remodeled, so a beautiful building. Convenient ins and outs. They got my order right, no complaints. ",1
Really Good service. I ordered a breakfast burrito and Mocha Ice coffee,1
"Quick service inside. But drinks are behind the counter!!

PARKING NOTE: Make sure you park before you get to the drive thru, there is no way back in from that point on!!!!!",1

I enjoy coming to eat to this McDonalds. But the cashiers are very slow. And many of them have bad attitudes,1
Today was not a bad experience friendly fresh food fairly clean Lobby I actually enjoyed myself here at McDonald's this morning,1
No surprises for my $4 dinner a $2 bacon double cheeseburger a $1 McChicken and a $1 iced tea. The location isn't too bad for being downtown Miami,1
The best food ever. I been enjoying the hospitality of eating at McDonald's for years and always a pleasure going there for a quick meal.,1
Orders come correct and fresh Everytime never have a problem food also tasted great,1
Very clean store and they let you use the restroom. Somtimes you need to go.,1

This is a VERY clean McDonalds,1
It was all right said quick service.In and out.,1
Miss this Mc when I used to work around there the hispanic lady who helps in drive thru is amazingly nice and super great worker.,1
best managed store in MIA.  the others could learn alot from these guys.  But it's location at 36th and Biscayne makes access in and out a challenge.,1
Tax service great place dairy Queen easy access to drive through and walk up dinning,1
Thanks for getting DJ Khalid his happy meals!!!,1
Food fresh all the time. fries hot. Customer service needs to improve a little.,1
Fast and quick but don't forget to ask for napkins and ketchup. They don't automatically put them in the bags.,1
Dollar men and other cheap food. Could be your best place if you ar,1
"Fast service, good staff. 2 McChickens and a large fry were really good",1
Good caramel frappe i order sweet and they gave me what a want it,1
"Comes handy late at night, pretty fast service and there is always coffee available.",1
This McDonalds is amazing sometimes it messes up the ingredients but in a overall it is perfect,1
This place is really nice. I loved the decoration.,1
Fast service. Always get my order correctly.,1
Excellent service and clean restaurant as well clean eating areas.,1

"Stopped by from Canada trip with my family, ordered Big Macs and quarter pounder. Both burgers were super fresh. Will definitely  stop by, the lady on the counter even brought us the food since we didn h",1
"Being that it's the first Mickey D's after you cross into the US from Qubec, Canada, this place gets seriously packed at times with the Canadian tourists. I saw 2 buses stopping in to feed their passengers during my short visit here, on top of the regular customers and/or those that are traveling by cars. Just like those working at Mickey D's over the border in the Canadian side (mainly showing French), these workers only spoke English and weren't too thrilled about French-only customers. I used the app to place my order, which was more convenient and the workers seemed to appreciate that more, since they don't have to deal with extra people face-to-face. My order came out in timely manner (even with tons of tourists flooding in) and the food was good. Staff was friendly as they get. Huge parki",1
Great stop after coming over the border! Truck parking and green grass for the dogs!! Always clean inside and order is always correct!,1
Fresh and good! Plus very clean and modern. Probably the nicest McDonald's I've been to in a while.,1
Honestly best customer service from Naisha thank you,1
"There's nothing like eating a spicy Mc chicken at the legendary pier.
The prices are good (as always). I highly recommend the dollar menu, in this case, 2 Mc chickens for only $4. The taste is very good! For the price of course. And the spicy one tastes even better. Service was very fast, but it can get very packed in the afternoon. Plenty of seats and restrooms are available as well (it gets packed, too). Pickup available. The everyday McDonald's, but placed in a crowded and convenient spot. We highly recommend spicy Mc chicken with extra buffalo sauce!",1
"I don't eat at McDonald's, but I do UberEats deliveries. I love this McDonald's because it has a parking structure in an area that typically doesn't have one. This makes it very convenient for me and people who choose to eat there.",1
The Santa Monica location is on par with most McDonald's out there. The food was satisfactory and the speed of service was reasonable. My only problems with the experience were the restaurant was incredibly busy and the smell of pot was pretty strong from someone smoking it out on the patio. They had the munchies I guess.,1
It McDonald ,1
Look the staff here is great despite the unwanted obvious nuisance. Food is prepped fast and staff are professional. Restroom are actually kept clean again despite certain unfortunate citizens. I always take out from here and go to the beach. Or park my car at the very top of the lot and eat there.,1
"It's McDonald's...by the pier.  McDonald's. In the wee hours (only time I go) it can be colorful with the occasional altercation/conflict, but they have security.  Never had a issue there.  Order my food from the kiosk, wait, p/u, eat while I walk home and later wish that I didn't order 3 to 4 sandwiches.",1
Good place. Can get crowded sometimes but the service is quick. I had a huge order and was served in under 10 minutes. I love McDonald's quality so much. This particular location is also right down the street from Santa Monica Pier. A great place to eat before going to the beach!,1
"Everytime I go into the Santa Monica McDonald's, it able to handle the busy times. In my opinion consider the customer traffic, however they waist no time getting orders, if you do not have a cloud following, then you should get what you want. Bathrooms have intermittent traffic depending on the busy time. I see they want you to enjoy your meal, in my opinion. In the pictures you will available seating at a perfect time. I was satisfied!",1
"It's a McD's, fast food cause you don't have a lot of time when you're going somewhere. Convenient place to grad a quick breakfast in the morning with all other shops still closed",1
"It has been a mighty long time since I need ed to concern myself with dining in at McDonald's.
Since Covid19, the option to dine in was removed. Remarkable.",1
Your service was excellent the employee Erica needs a raise because when I got there the lines were long and she cleared them out real fast thank you Erica,1
"Nice place, even with the homeless around it clean and comfortable place. The food preparation process is fast and the staff are nice. I had tried the first tim",1
It's not clean and there are no offers but still ok. Bathroom is usually clean,1
Lots of homeless people inside,1
"No drive thru, enough parking. Crowded but fairly quick. They had the front doors open and I could feel the air moving, not stuffy. Mask optional at the time (July/28/22). All employees were wearing masks. All employees were pleasant or acceptably neutral and doing a good job. Bathrooms and tables clean.  Floors looked pretty good too considering the large amount of foot traffic. Indoor and outdoor tables. Whenever someone got up, a worker appeared shortly after to spray and wipe down the table. In person you can order at  cashiers or use one of the 8 self-service screens. I believe you could also order through the app. There's a scanner at the bottom of the payment pinpad.
Didn't have to wait very long for my food. Less than 5 minutes.",1
Located on State Street in Hurricane Utah! It connected to 711 Gas Station so this makes traveling easy for food and gas stop! Has,1
"Hungry? Won't spend much money? Go to Mc. Donals! Come hungry, leave happy!",1
"clean tidy mc donalds. helpful staff. lots of seats both indoors and outdoors. love they didnt have the stupid oversized ipad ordering system which they have in the UK.
its a short walk from or to the beach near santa monica pier. and a short walk from the train station blueline and not far from the local shops.
please like this review if you find it helpful
thank you",1
Great place to eat awesome staff friendly and helpful enjoy your meal as you'll be loving it.,1
"To be honest, I usually frequent this local Santa Monica Micky D's for its coffee. I have to wake up pretty early, so a nice jolt of caffeine helps me start the day at 5am. With that being said, I will also say that because of Santa Monica's influx of homelessness over the years, this particular location gets alot of homeless patrons. Most are nice, and I buy some of the regulars a thing or two from time to time; however, it's the aggressive homeless patrons that make the place feel troublesome. The staff tries to placate situations, but you can tell they are getting frustrated more and more everyday. So, if you can't handle, talk, be patient, and react positively to people who are just trying to get through the day, the don't go here. I don't need you screaming and being annoyed at every little thing. Bye!!",1
"This McDonalds is conveniently close to Santa Monica Pier (about 1 block away). I love buying food from here and eating it by the shoreline with friends :,). Do note, that workers can sometimes be very stingy or serious due to the large amount of people that come in daily (this McDonalds in particular gets very packed). So please be kind to them, they are trying their best to get your food served! <3",1
One of the Best McDonald's so far. Good service,1
"Good location, very big place",1
"Doing their best for no man and the food is still the same level of addicting.  No drive-thru and right next to the beach.  It is usually teeming with people and it is usually a little busy.  Kiosks available.  On this trip, the payment option for me was unavailable on the kiosk.",1
Loved our family afternoon there,1
Basically what you want from McDonalds without all the bums and beggars in the store during the day,1
"It's a Nice McDonald's due to location you can grab a small amount of food and go to the pier, also people talk about beggers being near it but I didn't see any all I saw was a man overdosing on drugs",1
Friendly staff and fast service,1
"High traffic fast food restaurant that doesnt fail on being exactly just that. In the process ,  however ,  it also us one of the few places in the area that offers a no frills area to eat your food AL FRESCO. And in this day in age ,  thats priceless.",1
So busy. Staff are literal heroes.,1
"The only reason I am giving this location for stars instead of 5 is because overall, I don't eat McDonald's or fast food. However, the one day that I did go to Santa Monica, I just had a sudden craving for something fatty and sugary.

I went inside and dislocation surprisingly very clean. The staff there were also very hospitable, friendly, and alert. I ordered me some french fries and a sweet iced tea, and then I proceeded to the outdoor Courtyard to eat.

Out there was just as clean as it was on the inside. I haven't had McDonald's since 2012, so I was really surprised at how fresh the french fries and the sweet iced tea taste it.

Everything was okay okay with me.",1
"If we focus too much on ourselves and the troubles in our lives, it is very difficult to be happy. Lord, refresh my spirit, help me let go of longing to become something I am not and show me how to be the best of who I am.
Open your mind and empty your heart of fears so that you can know and experience God to the fullest. Lord, You are my peace, my assurance and the love that I hold on to.Reach higher than you think possible for all that you want and you find that often you attain even more. Lord, I rely on Your promises made to each of us and especially on Your love.
Be patient with others, but mostly be patient with yourself. Lord, help me to keep a smile on my face and to realize my goodness and refuse to dwell on my imperfections.Desiring more and more without appreciating what you have right now will never allow you to be truly happy. Be grateful for the gifts you are receiving right this very minute. That's happiness!God gives abundantly to those who pass His gifts on to others. Lord, let Your blessings flow in to me and then out from me. I will neither be selfish nor let my gifts stagnate.
Use Jesus' as your example on how to live. Lord, You will guide and advise us and then You will leave it to us to decide our own future. Give us wisdom in our choices.Dear Lord, thank you for being such a loving God and caring about our pain. You don't want to see us suffer. You know the suffering that we face, and I ask that you would please redeem it and bring it to an end. In the midst, Lord, I believe that you are sufficient. I ask that your strength will be made perfect in our weakness. In Jesus's name, amen",1
Always has an abundance of homeless population hanging out inside and outside. (Remove that you get 5 stars) Felt dirty although they were constantly cleaning the restaurant. Food is your typical McDonald's no change there. They offer a bathroom but its a busy location. Overall I'd return with caution ,1
"There have been issues with some of the patrons getting out of hand with the staff, but it seems that the issue has improved. My family generally order through food delivery apps from this location to avoid unruly patrons. They always get our order right, and the delivery is seamless.",1
There was a psycho there but the guard tazed her,1
"Very nice, very clean.
Saw a guy come in who ""looked"" homeless and 2 security guards immediately swarmed in and ushered him out. It was kind of impressive, yet I felt so sorry for the guy and thought security should have been more sensitive when doing the job because the man clearly wasn't all there.

Also, the men's rest room was very clean, however I'd prefer paper towels on hand in addition the the blowers. I had to touch the press down facet button and I had to touch the soup dispenser. I like to use paper towels to touch these things... especially the door when leaving...",1
Wonderful beachside McDonald's on Santa Monica Beach... food is excellent and the restroom is open to the public until 11 p.m.,1
Fine it's always busy place,1
Good McD centrally located and quick service.,1
We usually go mainly for the soft serve covers and sundaes.  Nothing hits the spot on a hot day like a small sundae.  Prices are perfect and the kids really appreciate the treat.  Hot fudge on the bottom really makes it fun for them.,1
"Convenient location and although there are some challenges the area faces (homeless and everything that goes with that), the restaurant does a good job keeping things clean, service helpful, and food good as always. We had an order with a lot of custom requests for kids (no this, extra that), and each burger was put together exactly as ordered.",1
Santa Monica pier is a few steps from here.,1
"No different than any other McDonalds, except that it's in Santa Monica very close to the pier and beach. It's surprisingly well kept and clean and very fast. Lots of tourists and visitors and the location is updated with the order kiosk systems so can get moving pretty fast. Seating can be an issue on very crowded days. Over all good experience and not too bad.",1
"They always have a lot of staff in hand, specially on the week ends and at peak hours. You will always see a lot of tourist due to the perfect location near the shopping and the pier. This also means that there will be homeless there as well. I like to live and let live so I don't mind sharing space with my fellow man. With that said there is security at hand at all times. Even when this place looks crowded the service is fast and like most McDonald's with a smile. You get something to eat at a great price in a perfect location.",1
"They accidentally gave my friends and I a whole order that we cancelled, and they also gave us the actual orders we bought. All in all they were pretty fast workers. They have to be because that place is always packed because of the Santa Monica Pier. I understand that it's not always going to be clean there because, frankly, there's not much room to clean there most of the time. If I could give 4.2 stars, I would.",1
One of the nicest mc donalds,1
"We ate breakfast here every morning while staying at a hotel around the corner. The food was always made correct and fresh, however the large amount of homeless people hanging out make things a little more difficult.  (No condiments are self serve,  the security guard has to let you into the bathroom, sometimes hard to find a table)",1
"I just had a large fry it was okay the kids had hamburger happy meals, the burgers were cold and ""tasted funny"", they ate the fries, and of course really liked the toy inside. 7 out of 10 today mediocre.",1
It was crowded! Unfortunately they don't do refills here.,1
They got the best breakfast here.,1
The service is fast but since the pandemic it seems that the mask is the most important thing.. security is polite and the Cusomer service associates are kinda formal but still polite...you can eat on the patio but not for long...,1
"It's McDonald's, cheap sustenance to keep on going. We had a couple burgers and fries and I can't complain they were alright when the price is taken into account. It can be quite busy at times so keep this in mind when going at peak times. The restaurant itself was pretty clean, what you come to expect from a McDonald's.",1
"The service the is great! They do a awesome job with the food, and it has security there so you don't have to worry to lose your chicken nuggets,  and hamburger,  also your money!",1
Great place to eat by the beach without the ridiculous prices . Beware that many homeless people ask you for change but never wanna change the sense of direction his life is unnerving to give people money as they bother while consuming meat patties between buns of bread with seeds. Moral of this review is to never help homeless while eating,1
"Gets very very busy , but they are normally fairly rapid about getting everyone through. By far the cheapest food place in that area, so ideal if you're just visiting. It's still McDonalds though so don't expect anything different from every other franchise.",1
We only eat halal food. The fillet o fish is a good choice for us but the price is high. Though it,1
Only place that is open late night in Santa Monica after 11 pm. Service great and you know the product. Very safe and family friendly. Great location,1
This place is a major tourist hub as it is located within a few blocks from the Santa Monica Pier. Inside is nice. They will also bring food to you that you won't see in any other store or this may be new to me since I have been to Mcdonald's only a few times in my entire life.,1
It's a McDonald's it didn't disappoint. I got another one supersize. And that's what I wanted. Fade Out on the floor back back back to get a bag over there balcony. Exactly what I wanted no surprises.,1
12 midnight this place is packed and they bring it to your table!,1
"Hot and fresh! I always get the Quarter Pounder with cheese,  mac sauce,  pickles and shredded lettuce only!! It's the best!! You gotta try it.

"First thing that caught my eye was its employees, within the times I've stopped by this branch of the Goldin Ark. Reason being is do to it's great customer service. I understand most McDonald's now have self service available to its customers but the times that I've gone to the beach in Santa Monica it's always been alot easier to be attended by their kind employees.",1
Right in front of the WORLD FAMOUS Santa Monica Beach Pier!,1
"They were friendly but they never gave me a tray because they never asked ""for here or to go"". The service was fast, I had my food ready before I could fill up my drink.",1
One of the oldest piers in the country and one of the Top places to visit while in #LALALand,1
"It was nice compared to how it was before, quick if you use the machines to order your food. You can pay credit or cash at the counter or the machine.. order was quick food was dope no issue.",1
Fresh Air an clean facility,1
"Eco-friendly flatware, restroom is locked up tight (transients). Employees are dismissive and arrogant. Not courteous and refuses to answer questions about food products, ie: what's on a cheeseburger answer would be... ""Cheese & bread""! But the food is hot and fast.",1
The food was fast and good for McDonald's. The inside seating area was kinda small and there were a lot of homeless people hanging out in front of the building. The entrance smelled like urine.,1
"They literally almost got the entire order wrong, would not come back ever. My family got two deluxe s round egg, 1small decaf coffee, 2 med coffees with sugar and cream. We ended up with packets of ketchup, no bread for the muffins in the deluxes,no hashbrowns and the wrong amount of cream.

Ok sorry I actually came back the other day and the food was amazing this time. Also, there is another McDonald's in my area that's pretty lame. This place has a better service overall.(sort of long review sorry)",1
"I got my food at around 10 PM on a Thursday night. The McDonalds was packed with people, yet I only had to wait a few minutes to get my food. The staff was friendly and my food was made really well.",1
The restaurant was clean and orderly. Food was prepared fast and made properly. Everything was decent.,1
"The recently advertised 100% real meat patties for their Quarter Pounder burger, more or less, was what you expect--same great taste, same great value, though it did not fail it however didn't feel any different from their other burger options on their selected menu.  Would I get it again?  Yeah, why not?  Makes for a mouth watering meal on the go, quick to be served and ready in minutes with that first warm juicy bite followed by a second, third and maybe fourth?  Who knows, really?  Just Get It and Try One Out Today or When the Munchies hit Mount Everest peaks!",1
First the restroom was clean and it wasn't guarded with a keypad... When I see that I'll go elsewhere. I never use a restroom without purchase and I never ask . Even the chicken sandwich was fresh... Thanks for the service,1
Its mc donalds what can i say,1
"I ate there during a week while I stayed at Santa Monica, the service was really fast, even when the place was crowded.

The computer ordering system is really effective, they have 8 modules and they help a lot for taking orders faster.",1
"The interior of store has recently been upgraded and has made it a lot more pleasant to be in. Due to its proximity to the Pier, there are still plenty of weirdos and homeless people hanging out in and around the store...",1
It's fairly crowded but got my iced macchiato and apple pie. The staff were friendly and attentive for the short interaction.,1
"Lines can be long, but service is friendly. Sometimes it takes longer for the food to come out, but the employees compensate by doing extra for the wait. The employees do practice good customer service.",1
"It's an interesting location for a McDonald's, and this property must be super expensive. Aside from that, it's a good enough place, and I give it 4 stars based on the expectations that come from a McDonald's to begin with. If you're on the Pier and you want a big Mac or some mcnuggets, this is your spot.",1
They get you in and out fast. I love this McDonald's adjacent to the beach  and the Metro Expo Line,1
Blessya all let's all get along. McDonald is giving back .Teenager do have a place to stay it hard on them. Let's live and love. Homeless is trying doing it staying clean Amen. Grace..keep it moving.smile. Sister Ms Rose. PEACE,1
Joshua is cool and helpful. Went above and beyond. Good vibes and energy. Happy guy and honest about the products. Dude was cleaning the whole time and helping customer at same time.,1
"The order was done really quickly, and that was greatly appreciated because we were in a hurry. We bought 20 McNuggets and they tasted amazing! Every one!",1
"The terror of the men was palpable in the air. The stench of blood and bodily waste clung heavy. It had been three days and four nights of terror. Ever since the men had come to this island,  it seemed like everything had gone wrong. Not just like God had abandoned them, but had an active hand against them. The coke here is always watered down.",1
Great customer service for such a busy location. Eating area is kept clean throughout despite obvious challenges of a beach location,1
"The food was good.  I mean,  they put several pickles in my yummy burger.  The fries were perfect.  The wait was a little long.",1
Always long lines .. use the app makes ordering much faster,1
"I love the CA McDonalds have McChickens (we only have Hot N' Spicy in AZ). The service was fast, and the food was fresh and cheap. It was also accurate (no missing items). This is how fast food should always be.",1
"Good as every other mcdonalds but only one big difference.. A lot like a looot of homeless people here, I like it because of the staff but too many homeless, that and this time the resroom run out of seat covers lol",1
"Ruthlessly expensive McDonalds food because it's by the beach, but they take the mobile order deals. Security on site though not too pushy. People seemed friendly enough.",1
"Experienced placing my order by computer touch screen, paying right there and shortly thereafter hearing my number called.  Nice, clean, super busy place.",1
Always very quick and helpful,1
"Nice place to dine in (outside obviously) and take out is fast. Just wish it had a driver thru, overall fast service.",1
Great place for inexpensive food right at Santa Monica Pier. There is also a public parking just below this place. But just inquire about the price first. We were charged $30 for parking and there were cheaper options available nearby.,1
The cheapest place to eat at when your by the pier literally. If your on a budget Mikey Ds serves you at its finest. The problem is they dont have the dollar menu anymore and this place can get packed during lunch hours.,1
"Haven't been here in a while, they have remodeled. They have self order and cashier order. It's close to the peir so expect your occasional homeless ppl but there is a security guard.",1
I go to every McDonalds I can. This one is quick service and good food. But please note that it gets a little crazy at night time. This is a very busy spot next to the pier.,1
Always a nice and friendly place to go. Fast and with good prices as always. It will be there when you need a food.,1
Always for my husbands coffe we stip buy. Value for money for a senior coffee.,1
"Was a McDonald's. You know what you get. The store itself was clean, the service was prompt and the people were nice. The automated ordering machines were a pain to use though and we gave up as it was unresponsive",1
"Kind of  confusing as people were just standing everywhere and one of the workers looked lost herself. Once it cleared out some t hmm ings settled, the food was accurate and warm :)",1
Wonderful customer service,1
"This is my go to McDonald's, now with automated cashiers ordering is quick and easy, nice and clean, courteous employees, it's just getting better!",1
Big Mac,1
Everything was everything as usual.  Keep up the good work.  Thanks to  McDonald's for a happy meal ,1
"No bad location easy to find, service is kinda slow at times though.",1
The food was great. Service was quick. They forgot napkins and ketchup for my to go order.,1
"Love the world's largest McDonald's.  Has a kids Play Place, fun arcade upstairs, elevator, can order pizza and many other cool menu items.

Although usually busy, service is on pace. Got my meal in about 15 minutes.  I love this location. Found parking in about 10 minutes.",1
"This McDonald is one of the nicest and coolest McDonald I퐒e ever been to. It is a two story McDonald with a play place and an arcade. They offer non traditional menu options, such as build your own pasta, ravioli, pizza, cake, cheese cake, etc. it truly is a one of a kind McDonald",1
"The World largest McDonald's is a must to visit if you have kids. Besides the typical menu items, you can order pasta and pizza, customized to order. The dessert menu is not a large selection but pretty tasty. Only downside is the wait for the food ... about 30 minutes for us so the food was room temperature when we received it. Of course, the kids can and will spend hours exploring the play area and arcade (a few of the games were out of order and not many prizes to choose from). The place was packed when we visited. Overall a good experience!",1
"Hands down best McDonald's ever!! We loved the game room.
The prices were so reasonable, $25 was more than enough chips to play for as long as we wanted.
They restaurant was clean, the food was fresh and staff was friendly. It also had an elevator that goes to and from the game room and restaurant.",1
"World largest McDonald's. Food is the same, they have pizza and pasta too. The seating and ordering process was quick and easy, but actually getting the food on time together was a challenge.

Our burgers came in fairly fast 10 minutes or so, but pizza took 30 minutes+ from the time when we ordered it. I had to come down and ask for my order for them to give me the pizza.

Honestly, this worth a single visit, especially the playground if you have kids. If you looking for a quick bite, I would go to the other locations with less people and quicker service.",1
"This place is huge! Large play place and fun arcade.

Pizza at McDonalds?! Yup, we tried it. Overall it was delicious and had great flavor, although the crust was a little thin for my liking.

Overall fairly clean, floors were a little sticky. Bathrooms were clean.",1
We couldn't wait to visit!!! The atmosphere is a little hectic but the food is amazing! Definitely not food you would eat at your hometown McDonalds. Highly recommend the pesto pasta and chocolate peanut butter cake. Don't forget to visit the arcade and play center upstairs. Watch your child's face light up when you pull into the parking lot!! Highly recommend,1
"This location is nice and they deliver the food to your table. Only 4 stars though because the food was cold when it arrived. Probably would have given it 3 stars, but I got 2 extra nuggets in my happy meal.",1
"If you love McDonald's this is the place to go. They say it's the world's largest McDonald's. The menu is definitely a bit different with pizza, pasta and waffles as options. There was even an arcade upstairs and a elevator to get up. The sign says the restaurant is open 24-7 which is nice when leaving the amusement parks.",1
"We had the best time visiting the Largest McDonald's in the World!  This place is GREAT!  A must see if you're in the area!  I had the pizza and it was fantastic!  Next time, I'll try the pasta!  Staff was super friendly & helpful as well!",1
"Great experience. We came here on a recent trip to Orlando. They have a large selection of foods. They also serve pizza and pasta. There is a large bakery selection. On the second floor you can dine at one of the many tables or play in the large arcade. There is a large kids play area, but that is currently closed due to COVID.",1
"World biggest McDonald. They serve Pizza and Pasta here, I tried them both.
To be honest I didn know what to expect from the pasta but I guess i",1
"Very cool place, got food on menu you will not see at any other McDonald's.  The pasta was cool but not the best. Service was really good.  Had a good time...",1
"Overall a good experience at this McDonald's, the largest in Florida, if not the country a very big place. I actually did not go upstairs to the arcade area, just ate and ran. But additional options here, pizza and pasta, I had both and both equally good .  A little longer wait for those items, so expect the additional cook",1
"The food was good!! The soda was a little weak, but that's not what I go there for anyway. Fast service. Very efficient. The arcade staff could be a little friendlier. But overall we had a great experience.",1
"Came in on a Thursday night after a Magic game around 10:15 pm for the first time.  It was crowded with adults and children.  The ordering lines were long and playground was 70% full.  Seeing a few people with luggage and felt this could be there first or last meal in Orlando.  This is the biggest McDonald's in the world and the menus are different too, with pizza and pasta.  We tried the pizza and it was actually pretty good.",1
"Well, I guess I checked something off my bucket list I didn't even know I had... The WORLD'S biggest McDonald's?! How cool!! Pasta on dishware - at McDonald's?! Yes please! The place was a madhouse, but worth it for the experience. It was our first night visiting Orlando so we didn't let our kiddo run around the H U G E play area... I know, kinda mean. But the amount of children in it and not knowing how often it was cleaned had me a little nervous. Definitely worth the visit, even for just a cheeseburger! And KUDOS to all employees, this place is NUTS! AND a drive-thru?! Bless y'all.",1
"This was a great experience. I was staying at Orlando for a week and this was one of the places I wanted to go to. The pizza was really good, Mac tonight was also there which was mind blowing. My only complain was the pizza was pretty greasy, but other then that, I would recommend this for people staying at Orlando",1
Fantastic restaurant. You must visit when in Orlando. The service was good. The wait time for the premium menu items was reasonable. It was very clean and the staff was exceptional.,1
"The food was quality but service took a while.

I liked the food a lot. I had heard of the location having pizza and pasta so I got both. I also got a large fries a burger and drinks. Me and my party enjoyed the food and honestly the pizza was in some ways better than other pizza places.

Only con:
I'd recommend going through the drive through and not getting the special items only because the wait when you order pizza or pasta is increasing fast. Not sure if this is a regular issue but seems like when I have gone it's like this.",1
"Not entirely sure what I expected when going to the worlds largest 폦cDonalds?- I mean it just a fast food place right? Wrong.

The place is huge - brick ovens for thin and crispy pizzas, hand crafted pasta and speciality meal stations, the everyday McDonald kitchen then followed by a staircase to an arcade, playhouse and more sit down area.

The pizza was only $10 after toppings. It was a small personal pie - thin and crispy b",1
"Great place for the kids, playground  and playroom are great. I recommend  you the 30 min for just $5 play card while waiting for your food... it can take longer that other McDonald, very busy place.",1
Friendliest McDonalds staff I have ever met. Love the old school setup. Great pitstop during long drives.,1
Carmel Frappe should have it own line,1
The kids love them,1
"I'm not usually a fan of McDonald's, but this location had good food. It was also clean and the staff were friendly.",1
The kids we're. Satisfied,1

I enjoyed my deluxe spicy crispy chicken sandwich 占쏙,1
Fresh food,1
McDonald's as usual service was great,1
I always stop in to McDonald's to get a nice ice coffee with 2 pumps of sugar free vanilla. You can't go ,1
As always great costumer service and excellent food quality. After paying close attention to the conveyor belt I see the food is made above the restaurant. I think that's pretty awesome. Great costumer service as always. The ladies working behind the counter are definitely doing a great job.,1
"Very clean, and nice staff! A bonus: One of the people helping me with my order was from Michigan too!! GO GREEN!! And the manager was very helpful. The security guard had hit wits about him.",1
I stated at a near by hotel. This was the only thing around open late. Only the drive thru was open. The drive thru took 30 min. When it was my turn to order the cashier skip my lane and helped 3 car from the other lane first.,1
"There's nothing special about a big Mac. I'm not sure about this location, but I've definitely paid $18 for a big mac meal. Better at better prices elsewhere.",1
The fries were hot but barely had salt on it. I couldn't taste any flavor,1
The girl taking our order was so incredibly nice! She was helpful and cheerful and really got our day off to a great start! The food was great and and it was done quickly!,1
"I퐉 glad to see this location is finally open again. Everything in the drive thru was fast, smooth, and consistent with what I expect from a McDonald",1
What a awesome staff that works here ALWAYS smiles and willing to take your order and get it right. Ketsia is just a sweetheart and very attentive to anything that is needed customer service is out of this world.Conrad is wonderful and he has a pleasure to talk to always.,1
The guys in the drive thru were so nice!  Love the deals too! BOGO!,1
Food is always fresh. My son loves when we head over after school for a little lunch.,1
"This is one of the busiest McDonald I퐒e seen. On the rare occasions when I come here for a coffee and hashbrown in the morning, this place is always packed full of hungry, antsy customers. The staff are incredibly patient and hardworking. McDonald customers (myself included) are probably the most annoying customers in the restaurant industry, but",1
"In contrast to the many radical reviews, this location was slick, modern, new, & clean. Small downstairs because the kitchen is upstairs. At 4:00 p.m. there were about 3 to 4 times more cars lined up to get to the drive-thru than there were people inside. My food was fine nothing too positive or negative.
This IS a McDonald's- not your family BBQ.",1
"This is one of the best McDonalds I have been to. They were closed for several months due to construction. The great food and service has made up for the time when they were not operational. The food is always hot and the Buns so far have been fresh and soft. The best thing about McDonald's are the FRIES!!!!  Their fries are always fresh, hot, and delicious. The best part is they stand straight up in the box just as they do on the commercials and pictures. I don't mind waiting in the sometimes long drive-thru line for fresh food. Thank you for having pride in the food you serve.",1
"It's a newly renovated McDonald's, has a very skinny drive thru, so be cautious. It's advertised as 24 hours, but isn't always open 24. Have gotten food here several times since reopening. Every time food has been hot and tasted fresh. Customer service was surprisingly good. Will up date in the future. Trying to eat healthier...you should as well. Fa$t food $hould never be a daily thing. Warning ",1
"Had to order at the kiosk. Good was fast and freshly made, great for a quick meal on the go. The interior of the place was very sterile. No menus above the counter. This location was just remodeled too, not liking it at all.",1
I can always close my eyes and count on the flavor being the same decade after decade,1
Nice place very friendly. Needs to be a little more quicker. Its very small despite the tall building it was not busy either so the service shouldn't have taken so long,1
Great food and service! Cleanest most organized McDonalds I have ever been in!!,1
"The rest room was clean, I was craving French fries plus chicken nuggets and I got them, they were nice and crisp",1
"Best customer service we've ever had at a McDonald's and close to, if not the best, service we've had at any restaurant period. Clean, well managed, and unexpectedly a very nice experience with our family of 5 little kids. Thanks for exceptional service!",1
"The counter girl was very friendly and helpful! I want to use my app and the girl helped me out. I did have to wait almost 10 minutes to get someone to take my order.
Thank you!",1
"My friend and I ate here together, and we both deem this to be the best McDonald's that we have ever been to. Twice the manager came around to us to make sure that everything was going well. That's a first for me at a McDonald's.",1
I had a #BigMacAttack glad the sandwich was nearby this hour.,1
"A bit of a long line in the drive thru, but the workers where moving the lines along. They friendly at the windows.",1
"Hot fries and standard fare. Can get very, very busy in weekend nights at the drive through.",1
"Clean premises. Professional service. Delicious food. When it's less busy, they'll come up to your table to check on your experience.",1
I want to return to this McDonald's some day when the pandemic ends. The lobby looks cozy to dine in.,1
First time back since it was remodeled. The girl in the drive thru was great. Very friendly and personable.,1
24 hrs. Isn't that enough? Hot coffee? Comfort food.,1
"Super clean, super neat, new self service is great, my son loves it, search deals!!! Take advantage of them!!!",1
"Good coffee, excellent food, nice people.",1
"2 lanes, moves super fast.",1
Newly renovated. Not a McDonald eater. Had some free time so I decided to have a cup of coffee with pie. Loved it.,1
"Good location. I went in as the drive thru line was a little long, must be a busy area. I got my food quick, I only had to wait a couple of minutes, I was not even able to fill up my drink cup before my food was done. The staff was quick and friendly.",1
"Great service! Food is hot and fresh!
Im loving it! ",1
It was clean. It was not too crowded. The items I ordered were up fast. It's a place to go when you don't have a lot of dough and not a lot of time. I try to eat healthy but sometimes you just need something fast.,1
"First time to this location, came at night (between 10pm and midnight) and was pleasantly surprised how fresh everything was and made to order, the fries were fantastic and my GF loved the Oreo McFlurry.

Will be back when I get my next craving!",1
"Decent McDonald's, newly rebuilt, quick drive through.  Sometimes food's been under heatlamp a bit long though.",1
"I only eat McDonald's once or twice a year, and after 22 years in the neighborhood this location is - in my experience - the best of the chain within a mile of the length of Ventura Blvd.  Fries have always been fresh.  Service has always been efficient.  Don't let long lines scare you.",1
This McDonald's is fast and very easy to get in and out of.,1
This is one of the best McDonald's. Place is clean and it gets quite a bit of traffic. Parking is tight but the drive thru(24 hrs) is short. The staff is mostly young professionals and they represent themselves well. Great fast food.,1
Little bit of a wait but that's pretty much everything in LA chicken came out hot and they remembered the sauces. The location didn't look too shabby but if they had a larger parking lot they could probably not contribute to the traffic on the street.  It's McDonald's not a chic-fil-a  you get what you pay for,1
Nice clean location. Customer service was super friendly and professional. Nice seating available. Outside seating also available. This location has 24 hr drive through. Overall great experience. Keep up the good work!,1
"Carlos, the young man running the front, was so friendly and all smiles even though he was getting overran and I myself was a bit of a problem for him as I had 5 kids who ordered 10 minutes apart from each other and changed their order twice. He still managed to take it all in stride and got us our food in a reasonable amount of time and with a smile on his face!",1
"A little small for my taste. It is one of the older McDonalds, so it doesn't have outlets.
The staff is great, though! There is one dude that works in the morning that is always so nice, and it seems like he never has a bad day! None of the staff (as far as I have seen) discriminate against homeless people. Their humanity gets them the extra star!",1
"Beware of the parking, it is very crowded and the drive through is inconveniently located  very closely to row of cars backing up and when gets crowded, if you are backing up you may have to wait or  even worse get hit by a car backing up (I actually saw this).  Not a big fan of McDonalds food, but the fries are classic and a tea no sugar is refreshing.  My order is always small fries and large tea no sugar.  Service is always great.",1
This place has clean restroom. The parking is free but is mostly full and requires some wait to park. The dining area is not so big but clean. The cashier was friendly and welcoming. I like that breakfast was served all day.,1
"As always, McDonald's prices are good for your pocketbook. Bought it for my three little friends and they were very full. And my wallet was very happy. Very friendly employees as well.",1
"Although it took longer than I expected to dine on, there was actually service and concern from the attentive  staff. And I really like the burgers. I get a qtr pounder with cheese and dont eat the  bottom bun.  To cut carbs. If you do it quickly the cheese doesn't melt so it very easy to go openfaced!",1
It's a McDonald's like any other.,1
I am so happy and glad that they finally reopen. And a new remodel is amazing really nice.,1
"Great, friendly, efficient service for a quick bite in the car. The fast food was served piping hot and the sauce to meat ratio was on target...French fries were seasoned perfectly with just the right amount of crunch.",1
"Got the spicy nuggets, everything was great! HUGE shoutout to Michael on staff, legendary experience with him!!",1
It's McDonald's but not too bad considering they just completely remodeled the place. The kitchen is now upstairs and it has smaller foot print with a bigger more organized parking area.,1
Cool new McD's with the kitchen on the Top floor.  Needs sum better decor very plain,1
"As far as McDonalds go, this is a pretty good one. Know how I can tell? Fries are *always* blistering hot.  I live near this McDonald's and I don't have to force myself to come here even though I pick up food 2 or 3 times per month. Stuff that's supposed to be hot is hot; stuff that is supposed to be cold is cold. As far as the service goes, here's the amazing thing: mostly millennials are working here .... and the service is still good! If you are in the area and hungry, I recommend this McDonald's....but please don't tease the Millinials they get spooked easy and stampede.  Thanks.",1
It's a little bit hard to get in and out of the parking lot other than that everybody is very nice and it's a good facility they don't run as many specials or deals like by two or buy one get one free on the breakfast sandwiches and stuff like a lot of other McDonald's do so that's why I didn't give him five stars other than that the place is clean and they're good,1
"McDonald's is awesome, get the app with that you can get 99 cent large iced coffee!",1
Small but very busy McDonald's location with a drive thru.  They offer their standard menu and service is reasonably fast.  They do have extra attendants working the drive thru during busy hours to try and move traffic along.,1
I ate so many big mac. A  Lot. 4. I love mcdanal an big Mac plz,1
"The new design is futuristic. Self-order, no register, sleek design, compact. Impressive.",1
It's McDonalds. If you don't know to check your bags before you pull away then you've never been to a fast food restaurant before. The service was friendly and the new menu items are fun to try. Seriously though it doesn't deserve one Star reviewing... I've been to some true one Star places and this isn't one of them.,1
"This place has a small parking lot, but the inside is generally clean and cool. The soda machines Diet Dr Pepper tastes a little off, other than that the service is good and the food is well put together.",1
They know how you make early morning coffee taste yummy to the last drop.,1
I used to work across the street so I would go there quite often. Usually quick. On occasion I would wait 20 minutes to get my order. Otherwise good service.,1
"This McDonald's ice cream machine has never once been broken anytime I've ordered ice cream, and that's literally the most I could ask of any fast food establishment.",1
My fa our place for coffee. Always we make sure we get the senior coffee.,1
Super clean. Amazing customer service and the vibes here are really great. This location is in my top 3 favorite McDonald restaurants.,1
The guy taking our order for drive thru (he was standing outside taking orders) was really nice and helpful.,1
Service member that took my order was my lifesaver this morning. God bless you and your family plus staff members. #framily,1
"My burger was fresh cooked, perfect in every way. The fried were hot. Fast friendly service. Great mc donalds.",1
It was very busy for the time I came in. I had a 15 minute wait on my food,1
This location always seems to be on top of their game.  The drive thru line at rush hour goes quickly and the servers are friendly and efficient.  Love this McDonalds!,1
"I guess for a McDonald's, it deserves 5 stars because it was perfectly a normal McDonald's, but it is still the lowest common denominator when looking for food, so...

Don't expect ""more than McDonald's"", but it was clean and the food was hot.",1
Loved it ordered the new beacon extreame burgar without onions. Nice choice from Spain. The lobby is clean and neat and the service is quick.,1
Very good service my 1st time here ..me and my kids are in a vacation so we decided to eat here and the greetings and food quality really good i give it 5 stars .. Recommend to come here.,1
It's open 24 hours (the drive through at least) so you can get that item your craving for day or night! Good service & friendly staff!,1
Best McDonalds ive ever been to. Food was very fresh and well made. Service was timely considering the amount of customers that were waiting. Will definately be back!!,1
Hot and fresh in the throws of a lunch rush. Best Quarter Pounder i've had in a minute,1
"It was McDonald's!  The service was fast and friendly.  The food was good and most importantly the FRENCH FRIES were HOT!!
NOTHING WORST THAN COLD FRENCH FRIES! !",1
my country men was serve and assist my order.  thankz,1
"The usual McDonald's clean, very busy, parking is not great it is a very active drive thru. I was able to park but getting out was harder.",1
This is my go to McDonald and it,1
excellent place to dine fast service,1
"Love stopping through here before or after work! The restaurant is smaller many, but makes up for it in Customer service and accessibility.",1
Went through the drive through was good service and fast inside looks big and spacious in case you prefer to eat inside,1
Great Customer Service Friendly staff. Got My Order Done in A Timely manner. Thanks MCDonalds Staff.,1
Always quick and easy out of this location They managed to keep this place very clean,1
It's fast food right? But the service was friendlier than you'd normally associate with fast food and that was from interacting with three different,1
Always buy my ice coffee here usually it's perfect but a few times it taste really watery or over loaded on cream/milk or even vanilla flavor,1
"The standard McDonald's menu, the staff is friendly the restaurant is clean. They do get busy and sometimes they get a little behind but not a lot.",1
"The new rebuilt mcdonalds looks nice, also 2 drive thru lanes now.",1
It's not a great place but it's not too bad of a McDonald's to just go in & have a quick meal to eat there or take it with u,1
"Drive thru was fast with 3 point contact. Order taken in line, payment window then pick up window",1
Good service and got us everything quickly.,1
We always have fun at McDonald's,1
Nice customer service free Wi-Fi and they even have outside seats small parking lot though. Overall good experience.,1
Very friendly staff and quick service. One of the better McDonald's I've been to.,1
Besides the guy with the meth pipe going through the trash the food is as expected. It's not McDonald's fualt there is a methademic,1
Friendly and fast. No issues,1
Quick service friendly staff food was yummm... and the two breakfast sandwhiches for $4 is awesome!,1
"I went today, 11:15am, asked for the free big Mac/maccoin, they said, they were not authorized, 08/02/2018",1
Made a quik stop during lunch hour rush and was in ans out of there fast with great sevice and freshly cooked fries and a bomb oreo shake.,1
Good food.,1
"Fast service, friendly, bathroom wasn't available, over all thank you",1
Place is too small. Once you order I waited for my food and I really didn't have anyplace to stand without getting in someone's way.,1
Drive through is faster than walk in. Food is good for McD's.,1
Very good service and my food came out really quick good coffee and quality food,1
Very friendly fast counter personal..always willing to make sure your order is correct,1
I've never had a problem at this location. The best employees thus far,1
"The Place was okay, excepting the bathroom,  i know it's difficult have that clean and beauty but could be better conditions",1
The second story is a lie. There is only 1 floor.,1
"Open 24 hours in the dining room as well as the drive-thru. And WiFi, too! Thank you McDonald's!",1
They do an amazing job here in the mornings to get all us busy people in and out quickly!,1
"Ay listen here, this place gets 5 stars err day of the week. Tuesday to Monday. Real fries realfries real frys",1
"Great job at this location, from Orlando, Fla tourist.",1
McDonald's in North Hollywood very good customer service you got to deal with the homeless a lot right there though a good McDonald's to go to,1
Fast and efficient.,1
We got mcdonald's then we drove to San Diego and than I proposed to my wife at tuna park.,1
I don't really eat food at Mcdonalds but I stopped in there frequently for their hazelnut iced coffee.,1
"McD's is always a good time, but this time was great! All thanks to the cool staff!",1
Small but friendly and clean.,1
always cheerful and always helpful. great service. the only downside is OVER RUN BY HOMELESS PEOPLE all the time!,1
"Long drive thru line, very fast service. Impressive",1
This is my favorite place fair prices good food and the best crew,1
Would have got five stars but they were out of ice cream cones... Boo!!!,1
"Its McDonalds.  Drive through is narrow and has a sharp turn, but other than that one thing, it's your standard McD's.",1
This McDonald's is kicking ass and taking names. Puts the others to shame. Love this location.,1
Didn't expect such great drive-thru so early in the morning.,1
Just like all McDonald's!  Nothing special! Always ask for fresh fries!,1
It's ok if you want something fast the people are friendly.,1
I had forgotten to order my cheeseburgers without onions but the lovely man behind the counter had them remade just for me at no charge.,1
"They are always crowded n drive through as well, but the service makes up for it",1
Very good coffee and the service really nice ,1
Good drinks at a decent price. Quick service.,1

Fast Happy meal! Accommodating and friendly,1
The McDonald's at Riverside was confusing because there was no River and this McDonald's was not at its side,1
Another McDonald's I frequent. The fries here are a little better than the NoHo one at Burbank Blvd.,1
"That big guy can really sing! Awesome place, awesome singing dude!",1
"Nice location, large and comfy, friendly staff, plenty of parking space.",1
I like this McDonald's out of all of the ones that I have been at because this is the only one that the walk in stay open 24 hours.,1
Sometimes busy. Some days drive through accept only cash.,1

Most convenient McDonalds. It can be busy and you might wait a little longer.,1
My rating is based on my love for the iced turtle.,1
This McDonald's was very satisfying and well organized with very much class,1
Double quarter pounder can't go wrong... with cheese,1

Very dirty everything and little staff,1
I love your coffee,1
Rico and his hot and delicious muffin sausages as always the only thing they don't put napkins or ketchup or spicy sauce,1

Everything is fine and the lady with brown eyes is very kind and pretty,1
I made pleasure i just passing by...and i am breakfast...I made hispanic ppl...attending me.,1

"Excellent service, tasty burgers and more, congratulations!",1
It lacks a bit of speed when delivering the product,1
"The drive through was very quick (the fastest I've experienced in many years - think NASCAR pitstop), the order was accurate, and the food was fresh & tasty.",1
Best customer service around ,1

Five stars for service.  This McDonald's should be a training store for managers. The manager and his entire crew were all about keeping the orders coming and making the customer job one. Haven't experienced this at a McDonald's in a long time. This McDonald's should be the standard the others have to meet.,1
Dine in area is fairly clean & they even have a nice sized playplace for the kids in a separate area from the main dining area. Staff is nice & quick.,1
"very nice and respectful customer service, and clean bathrooms!",1
Usually order ahead in the app and do curbside pickup. Process is easy and discounts are nice through the app. No issues with service or food quality at this location.,1
Enjoyed watching our two boys play in play area.,1
"Fast food, friendly staff, and ok coffee.",1
Went to work this day I was pressed for time but the drive-thru was very fast,1
"I think the morning shift are one of, if not the best, they provide great customer service and good food, definitely coming more to this McDonald占쏙",1
If you like McDonalds  this is s good one.  I like McDonalds.  占쏙,1
"They always have the nicest staff, and the tables and bathrooms are always clean. I can't figure out why people don't just accept the Golden Arches. The food is good, and nutritious. You don't need to order a big mac every time! Just get a salad!",1
"The interior was something I'd never seen before. There were planted boards you could use to place your order before reaching the counter, but the line was short so it wasn't needed. The place was clean and all the orders were right. It was a nice stop for a sit-down quick lunch like how fast food should be.",1
"This location has a fun indoor playroom area. The play equipment always seems to be clean and well-maintained. I take my two-year-old granddaughter there occasionally, and she always has fun. The only reason for the four out of five stars is because their projection screen/interactive play mat has not worked properly since we have been visiting there over the last year. It has partially worked on a couple of occasions and my granddaughter remembers that she enjoyed it. Every time we퐎e there she stomps on it to try to make it work. She will grab my hand and pull me over to the mat and try and get me to make it work. I",1
"I'll always come back here. The food's always right and the store and bathroom is always clean. Nobody bothers you. I even ate pizza here and the management didn't seem to care and it's a good place to eat and work. There aren't too many good McDonald's you can find a good plug in for your laptop but this one is awesome.

The staff is good and very helpful every time I go there. One day I was low on money but really had to eat. One of the guys who worked there gave me a break and upsized my drink as a courtesy. It was hot as $h&t outside and I had a longer lasting drink to curve the heat.",1
"Actually an especially above average location.  Service and food are what should be expected.  Clean.  Restroom has hands free door opener.  Kids Play Place is especially nice.  Has modern play equipment, toddler area and interactive life size video game station.",1
I can only speak to their breakfast as it's the only thing I've purchased there. Service is fast and the food is great.,1
"Best McDonald's around!
The people who work there are always super nice, the service is very good compared to other McDonald's in this area. And there are NOT any of those horrible self serve kiosks! Oh how I hate those things!!!
The restaurant is clean and we'll maintained.
This is my favorite!",1
We love coming here. Tried the Shamrock Mcflurry and it was delicious!,1
Their employees needs to learn customer service.,1
"Every once in awhile you just got to have a quarter pounder. Today it was a quarter pounder with fries and a Coke. So good. The Quarter Pounders are made with fresh meat now and you can really taste the difference. And everyone knows that McDonald's has the best Fountain Coke. They tested a couple of times per hour just to ensure the formula is Right. Plus, they have those nice fat straws that make for big sips. :-)",1
We did dine in. But used the app to order the food and it was ready in a reasonable time. We also got to enjoy the AC and sit inside and eat.,1
They made a mistake on my order but I hadn't left the parking lot yet. I called them and told them and they gave me the correct sandwich right away. Great service!,1
"What makes this place 5 star to me is the Manager.......Nikko!

Nikko is super friendly, genuinely caring about HONEST customers and makes you wanna come back for some of his cheer.
Service is great here with seldom a mistake in the mornings when I come in.

I've ubered and ordered at this particular McDonald's and I've always had a positive experience. They don't ignore you and they actually get to their customers in the order that they are in. Great team up there and positive work attitude!,1
Who doesn't love McDonalds fries... quick service it always fast not really a long wait... Mmmmmm fries.....,1
"Love this spot. Convenient location right off of major highways, food is prepared properly, drive-thru turns over quickly, coffee is delicious. No complaints. This is what every McDonald's should be like.",1
"Fast service, hot fries fresh burgers. It's McD's. Somehow the food is fresher in our drive thru only world...

People at this one always are nice considering they need to deal with peeps like me that never know what they want. It's been the same basic menu for decades. LOL",1
It's a pretty nice McDonald's. Not highest quality of food of course cuz it's fast food but I like the fries and getting deals. I've tried the mobile order a few times too and it's cool how they bring it to you and feels like there's less wait.,1
"If you don't know what you're getting into when you go to a McDonald's, you're probably coloring more often than reading. My Sprite tasted EXACTLY like Sprite.",1
"I wouldn't normally write a review, especially for a McDonalds that I go to often, but recently I have been going through the drive through and have seen a man that has twice as much enthusiasm as anybody else working there. I believe his name is Brandon, but every time I go he always seems to brighten my day.",1
"Some people still swear that McDonald's has the best coffee. It's not my personal favorite, but it's good and inexpensive. Discounts for seniors. Love the value meal selections too.",1
Very clean lobby and facility. Coffee was fresh. Service was quick.,1
The kiddos love to stop by and play in the play places.  This location has a bathroom in the play area which is awesome for the potty training years.  The resturant and play area was very clean and staff was around every so often to check on the cleaniness.  This is one of our favorite locations to visit.,1
Classic fast food with addictive french fries. Burgers are prepared and cooked the same across the US. Consistency and quality are worth each visit.,1
Always enjoy this McDonald's and I am not a fan of the food. The food is hot and correct majority of the time. The play area is great and staff is friendly. Keep up the good work.,1
They were wicked fast and very friendly! I had actually stopped going to any McDonalds because of bad experiences elsewhere with really dry nuggets. Did not regret getting food there today.,1
"Always fast, their food always tastes much more delicious than other mcdonalds.",1
"Clean play area for children, minimal staff but working hard. I asked for veggie sandwhich because I am a vegitarian, i said ""lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, onion stuff like that"" but my sandwhich came out with pickles and cheese. :0( they took it back put a tomatoe and 1 peace of lettuce on it. I wish McDonalds had a nice big veggie sandwich to fill me up.",1
"I just want to say
1. MCDonalds does NOT take phone orders!also you would not believe the amount of prank calls they get a night
2. There hasn",1
First time in a long time that I have been to McDonald's and the staff actually treated me like they appreciated my being a customer. I took off 1 star because they were stingy with the mayo on my hamburger.,1
They are doing a remodel for the lobby. But the drive through was open. Associate was very nice and we had a nice conversation while waiting on the food.,1
"They have big macs :) but no all day breakfast :(... mobile app works well though, make sure you activate the order when u arrive ""I'M HERE"" or no one will know what you're talking about",1
THE STAFF WAS KIND AND COURTEOUS. THEY QUICKLY CORRECTED MY ORDER WHEN I RECEIVED IT WITHOUT KETCHUP OR BBQ SAUCE,1
You are sure of a good meal every time! Had a great brunch there today.,1
Awesome vanilla cones!!,1
"My over 20 year experience with McDonald's Restaurants in this area (Southlake, Grapevine, Keller, Northlake, and north FW) This one is by far the best one. I have been eating food regularly from this Roanoke McDonald's for a little over a year now.  This is the only place that makes the Big Mac the way I remember it as a kid. I do not post reviews often at all. I am making this one because of my experiences at all of the area McDonalds. If you decide to eat McDonald's, go to this one.",1
That was the best quarter pounder I've had in years! .for real! Every once in awhile it's great. I would have taken a picture...but I wasn't thinking. Picture perfect,1
"Ate inside,  food was fine and order was correct.    Overall was a good visit.    Just wish was a little cleaner of a restaurant.",1
I think this place is under new management. I had a quarter pounder and it was really good and made right. Friendly service and very clean.,1
"Great neighborhood McD. It's not open 24/7, but has enough friendly staff to keep its drive through going while quickly serving your order if you're inside.",1
"Unfortunately they got my order wrong, but I still gave 4 stars bevause the employees are always so nice and friendly.",1
"Good food,friendly service and pretty quick as well",1
Guys just to let you know. I hate McDonald's!.... I just keep coming back and knowing that's its killing me. What I'm trying to say is that im addicted and I cant stop eating. I eat because I'm unhappy and I'm unhappy cause I eat. Lol 5 star,1
"Clean and good service. The only problem is the drive through window always open because the busy order during morning, flies get in easily.",1
"Came here for McDonald's, was not disappointed.... Loved the arches, some lady hit the curb behind me, kinda funny. Food and service were great.",1
Iced mocha is awesome they make it just right ,1
It's a McDonald's- standard to a fault.  Has a pretty clean interior but not a lot of booth seating.  The food is what you would expect from McDonald's,1
Good drive thru setup. Orders have been correct every time.,1
"They get the order right, the good is always hot.  The kids enjoy the play place and the whole place is clean.",1
"Best mc Donalds EVA!!!
they made for me fresh coffee (super quick) , and the cookies were just baked, you made my night guys!",1
Took my nephew to play & eat. First one ive been to with a working interactive floor projection game. Suited my needs,1
Not a big fan of McDonald's but I do love their fries and cheeseburgers!,1
This is a McDonald's so the food is normal and good I liked the service here and would come again,1
Good price clean and good services,1
It's McDonald's! One of the most ratchetest places you can visit for fast food,1
"The time I was there very busy. I ordered the a new cheese cake, so I had to wait. I didn't  have  to wait to long. A associate brought it to the car.",1
"Very tasty and very unhealthy. Perfect for weight gain and problems with digestion system. Still worth it. Try Double Quater Pounder Cheese, it was amazing.",1
"Only giving the 4th star for a good attitude at the window. Its a McDs so you know the drill supposed fast service friendly smile and hood food. Doesn't happen theses days but I am yet to have a server here that is rude, unconcerned, or uninterested in their job. They get it done efficiently and respectfully.",1
This place is absolutely delicious.The fries have a perfect amount of salt.The prices are very fair.Customers and employees very polite and sophisticated.This place should have the Kardashians swarming around.I mean it's boogie people good for cheap.,1
"Hey McDonalds, please go back having the 2/dollar Apple pies. I miss those apple pies that you can reheat in the microwave and eat with vanilla ice cream. Please consider!!. At this location the driveway was long but fast. It was just the drivers was taking their time moving up. My order  was right, the workers was respectful.  Yes I will go again. The food was hot占쏙",1
My go to spot for my son and I to get our hash brown before he has class.,1
It's been a while that I haven't went to McDonald's and we had just came out from a bar and wanted to eat my sister wanted White Castle put in the order cuz we weren't sure McDonald's was open and she had a craving for a Big Mac so sorry White Castle but we left them went to McDonald's order and at 1:15 in the morning. One of the freshers big bags and Fries that I haven't had in a long time it hits the spot no regrets not going to White Castle and it was quick the order and to get the food it was worth the trip,1
no experience I just couldn't wait to home I'm greedy,1
Fast. Convenient and friendly.. my orders are always correct and speedy drive thru service. Good friendly cashiers and managers. They even have an ordeing kiosk.,1
My experience here at the McDonald in Newark is ok the place is decent the restaurant is really clean and the vibe is new and updated I got the new shamrock shake McFlurry with Oreos it was very sweet but it was still very good the employees is ok but my on,1
Busy location but great customer service despite rude customers.,1
"I've been here many times and they've never messed up my order, which is a better track record than most McDs I've frequented. Above average for a McDs, but they should work on keeping the fries fresher... often old, stale, and gross. Few things better than fresh McD fries, and few things worse than old ones.",1
"This place is nice, even though all of them (the McDonald chain) serve the same menu the service here is ki",1
Nice clean loved it service was fast and it's quit  you can relax and enjoy your meal  the bathroom was clean I would go anytime if anything!,1
I went to a different McDonald's the one in New Jersey where my boyfriend lives it's good I would go all the way back over there for that juicy burger I had so mouth watery.,1
This place is ok....,1
Food has always been hot and fresh whenever I have visited,1
"Great service , and great crew",1
"Not bad, but they don't let people use the bathroom even if buying",1
Fast and friendly service.... Enjoyed the food.. Restroom was well kept,1
Just for a coffe have to wait longer than usually but I love the coffe.,1
The food is awesome and i love the soda and everything well more the frys i will like them to add basken roben ice cream because why not ?,1
This is a pretty automated McDonald. Probably one of the most automated ones I퐒e come across. Many of the customers went strait to the devices shown to enter their order and just stood near the pick up counter for their order. I felt the process was still a bit slow given that the emphasis is for automation though. Plus the area to stand was congested since it,1
"This maybe the cleanest McDonald I ever been to. I pass 2 closer ones from my house just to come to this one because of cleanliness, good",1
"More than 30 min of wait 2 buses should have arrived and both routes are late. I don't get it, if  paying with our taxes for this service plus a fare of 2 $ the ride, where is the investment of the company on providing a good services, more buses, more bus drivers better service, better budget. I called and the Lady on the phone left me waiting on hold. I'll seek for an investigation in this situation. hopefully Public resources are being well managed, RIGHT? 占쏙",1
It's nice to still have some locations open 24 hours. And despite mobile park/pickup or the dining room being closed. The way in which the team here was able to expedite the dining room was amazing.,1
"There are two lanes of drive through. I ordered on the mobile app while waiting in line.  When I got to the speaker,  they didn't bother to ask my order,  or order number.  They just kept taking people from the other line. I know that sometimes happens,  they forget the order cars pull up. But not 4 in a row. As they started taking the 5th car,  I pulled into the line and went to the window.  Food was OK when I got it.  But waiting 30 minutes for that to happen in the drive through isn't cool.",1
It's McDonald's McDonald's. What can I say. We wanted a snack and we're hungry. So we drop by this place.,1
One of the fastest McDonald's I've been so far. I ordered through the app and it was ready in just a few minutes. The place is clean and staff is friendly.,1
The workers helped me get a free apple pie plus they always made sure we had everything we needed,1
Are food was great that is why we have got breakfast every morning at the same location # Bring The Bagels Back,1
"Food quality is good, cafe is very clean and all staffs are very friendly. Location is also very good. If u want you can order food through self-order screen inside the cafe, drive through is also available. Good for kids as well because there is a kids playing area inside the cafe.",1
Manager was great. He unlocked the door just before closing to take my order. I was staying at the hotel next-door so i didnt drive over.,1
"Went thru the drive thru. It was around 11:30 pm, and the line went all the way around the building but was moving. Only ordered 2 large decaf coffees. They were fresh - made to order.",1
This store is always clean. The staff always pleasant and helpful. I've been impressed with them the whole 7 months I've been here.,1
Excellent and fast service. The food was good.,1
"Typical McDonalds but extremely long waits due to proximity to tourist attractions.  Be prepared to wait 20+ mins in the drive thru, even for a mobile order",1
"Clean place with prompt, and accurate service. The chicken nuggets were delicious and crunchy!    We ordered through the Drive Thru with hardly any wait time.  The attendant confirmed our order no less than twice, and I was given exactly what we asked.

The inside is clean (as well as the bathrooms) and has a lot of seating.  There's also an indoor play area for the kiddos.  In this location you place your order on the touch screens in front of the cashiers.",1
This is by far the best McDonald's I have ever been too. They serve you your food very quickly and take your trash. They walk around asking if you need anything and are very friendly. Very clean as well.,1
"Quick food, pretty clean environment, cheap food. It's a McDonald's, they don't vary too much in general. Though there are outliers, this one is consistent with what I've come to expect of McDonald's.",1
"Very polite service. Very clean. One has the ability to self order. Playhouse for the little ones!

Thank you Ileanna for the great coroner service. Keep up the great work!!",1
"For a McDonalds I was pleased. Ordered at a kiosk, but they brought us our food to the table. Order was correct and food arrived quickly. Quite clean.",1
Very long wait time but the food was good and the young lady at the second window was so nice,1
It's McDonald's. You know what you're getting. You know that every once in awhile and order is going to be messed up but if you walk in they're going to fix it for you and probably throw in a free French fry. There's no reason to give these service workers a hard time they're doing what they can. Thanks guys. Everyone once in awhile I want some chicken nuggies and and it's always you guys and your sweet and sour love sauce. Hot mustard is acceptable sometimes.,1
"Great food, service friendly and prompt,  restaurant very clean.",1
Employees are the make or break in the hospitality industry and Megan is the make of this restaurant!!!! Will return regularly just to say hi to her,1
Restaurant was clean and continually being cleaned...tables and floor..I liked this as it helps to keep the place looking well and controls the corona virus and other pathogens...food wad good,1
Disney McDonalds let us down so we came to this one and the night crew knocked it out of the park. Great job.,1
"They always have consistent food, no matter which one you go to",1
Stopped in for fast coffee but instead had the pleasure of watching Angelica work her customer service magic. She took the time to rework a customers order to take advantage of saving. His way of ordering would have cost $14 but with her assistance it was just $8. A blessing for this customer as he is on standby for the birth of his third granddaughter. Doesn't matter if you are spending $1 or $100...good customer service is hard to find. Stop in and get your savings with Angelica should you be in the area. 占쏙,1
"This is a Great McDs the food is alway hot&fresh and they are all nice unlike my local McDs in Lex,Ky",1
"More often than not, there is something wrong with the order when it is delivered.
8/23/22 - order came out correctly today
1/28/23 - fries were fresh and hot,  burgers were cooked to order; staff was friendly.",1
"As a McDonald's goes it was great. Fries where hot, burger fresh and the pies where hot. My only complaint is that the opinions where very limited.",1
Unique McDonald's in that they request you use the touch screen order kiosks. I was hesitant at 1st but actually very convenient. You can choose one of the numbered tables you sit at and they bring your food to you. And Quick service the couple of times I did.,1
"Great for post Disney/Universal tourist dinner    Amazing quick service, fresh food, super easy self service option. I asked for no salt fries and no salt fresh fries is what I got. I was hangry after being denied service at Checkers (they were not accepting walk up orders at 9pm).",1
"My favorite mcdonals. Fast service, great customer service and good food error free",1
Great experience.  Fast service.  Accurate order.  This location has the dollar menu.  Clean restaurant.  Highly recommend this McDonald's.,1
Just a standard maccies  I would prefer during the drive thru thst the menu ,1
"They were definitely earning their wages that day, it was really busy but the food kept coming out and orders filled",1
Great fast service. They actually put lots of onions and pickles on their burgers here. LOL. S0 I actually started enjoying their hambergers more .,1
The wait was really long in the drive thru but I can really c,1
"Ordered our food through the kiosk, served with a smile and very courteous. Very clean location. Though one of the managers was having to deal with a former employee that was trying to make a scene when the employee was clearly in the wrong, the manager kept her calm and remained professional as to not allow the situation to affect those in the restaurant. Very nice experience and would come back again when I am in the area!",1
"Man this place is so awesome when I rolled up there was a line going all the way to the stop sign it only took me maybe 15 minutes to get my food which is not bad at all. My wife is pregnant and was really craving and ice cream fudge Sunday their ice cream machine was down. I had ice cream at home but no hot fudge ask them to give me a couple few squirts of it and they obliged even though they didn't have a button for it I'm really happy and so is my wife thank you very much. Very chill people, appreciate you!",1
Food was really fresh and tasty.  Staff was very nice.  Huge line after parks closing but they cranked it out.,1
Easy and fast drive through experience. 24/7 is always a plus,1
"Ordered food inside, first time back in two years. We come to Florida for vacation and the staff here is awesome.  In and out in minutes,  keep up the good work ",1
The servers and associates behind the counters are great. Things get fix fast and are always fresh no matter the rush.,1
"Always worth coming to McD. The drive through was stabil quick, order was waiting for me, everything inside and no problem asking for more ketchup. The classics like big Mac like you would expect and good as always. Parking possibilities rigth in front of restaurant and drive in has even 2 lines. 5x",1
Great experience getting a late snack here tonight,1
Carmen the best she deserve a raise nice job,1
"Best McDonald's on planet earth. Our food was so hot and fresh. The best of the best for service, and preparation of food.",1
"This McDonald's usually ROCKS!
They can get thru a line that goes all the way to the highway in under 20 min.

Tonight,  there was no line. Also the inside was closed. AND...  THE ICE CREAM MACHINE WAS BROKEN/SHUT OFF. SHOCKER.

My son did something amazing at school and wanted a Sunday for a treat. So thats why we went.

Then they didn't put all the things we ordered in the bag and we drove off. 2 u turns in traffic and waiting in line now to get what they forgot.
So... I asked the manager if they could just add a small bag of fries since we had to do 2 uturns to get this item they forgot to put in the bag. She said No, we can't do that.
REALLY!?!?!?! I have worked in the food industry for 28 years.  I am well aware of what you can and can not do.
You didn't WANT TO. You didn't want to value me as a person, a customer,  or a future. You didn't want to do your job properly in the 1st place. You didn't want to apologize in any way shape or form.

I don't mind that a mistake was made. I do mind that they acted like it was my fault for ordering anything to begin with.

There are 22 other fast food locations in the quarter mile radius.",1
"The line was super long, but I guess that's what should be expected when you get off the airplane at night and it's the only place still open. Thank you, McDonald's! Despite the line the food was super good! The crispy chicken sandwich was shared hours later slightly heated in the microwave and still great! The McNuggets were even good 3 Days later according to my daughter :-)",1
Top of the line service. My husband and I came out from California to go to Disneyworld and the staff at this Mc Donald's was even more accommodating and friendly than Disney. The manager even came out to check on us. Just very impressed by how everything is running at this McDonald's.,1
They have the ordering kiosks here. It better to ,1
This location just recently allows you to dine in. But there are like 2 thirds of the seating unavailable.  The selfservice screen were not accepting card payments so you need to complete transactions at cashier anyways defeating the purpose of contactess ordering...,1
"Really great service at this McDonald's, manager Joseph was very helpful In getting my order placed with my over tired 3 year old.   Very friendly staff.  Food was hot and tasty but the staff makes this place stand out from the countless other McDonald's visits I have had.",1
This has got to be the best run McDonald's ever!,1
Awesome customers service. So so nice is an understatement of the employees. Fell in love with Micky D again after having lunch here.,1
We use the McDonald's app on our phones. They have the best deals for lunch. Most times they have if you buy one sandwich you get a second sandwich for $.29 They also have a large French fry for $1.00.,1
"The service is good and food is fresh , the only bad thing  is just that its always packed because is a tourist area.",1
Great Customer Service from the staff here.,1
Good food and service!,1
"Best icecream ever , vanila cone",1
I place mobile order at around 9:30pm and it was fast and no complains about my order.,1
"This location has kiosk to place your orders only, similar to New York, then you wait for your number to be called to get your food. Staff was very busy, place was clean. Not super friendly.",1
This McDonald's uses a kiosk for inside food ordering. However if you have problems they will take your order personally. My meal was very good and fast.,1
The drive thru lane was fast.When I got the meal it was fresh  and  taste it good..But the only thing the orange juice was warm and the coffee they put their milk and sugar but it was no sweet enough.Also they forgot to give us ketchup.,1
The cleanest McDonald's I've ever visited. The staff was unusually helpful and attentive. The checked in with us twice in the dining area to make sure our food was satisfactory and offered to get beverage refills for us and to bus our table for us. Very well run establishment. A completely new fast food experience for my family. The food was good.,1
"I eat here once in a while when I'm in a rush or just need a good fish sandwich. Always good and fresh, never any issues with the drive though (which 99 times out of 100 is what I use). Good place for fast food. Drive through attendants are always quick and polite.",1
"Came here after a negative experience with another McDonald. Super friendly people, quick service, and wi",1
Clean location good staff thanks !,1
"Busy busy, the staff work hard all excellent customer service . Specially Megan.",1
Pretty decent but the machines you go to for ordering was usually broken. I'm pretty sure the ice cream machine was broken at one point because we couldn't order any ice cream related products. All along it was a decent experience and I would probably go back again if I'm ever in the area again.,1
"Excellent and fresh, hot, food.  The inside is spacious and clean. Friendly staff but I don't like the system where you have to order by yourself with the large touch pad, makes it hard to customize your order and confusing.  I'd rather just wait in line and have the attendants take my order like most McDonald's.  But at this McDonald's you must order at the touch pad by yourself.",1
"super yummy stuff round the clock. If you plan a visit after midnight on Friday, Saturday or Sunday; expect long lines and extended wait times at the drive thru. always have cash handy since they may lot be taking cards at certain locations during the early hours. bon appetit!",1
"Friendly staff, always busy but food done in a good time and always hot. Restaurant kept very clean. Plenty of parking.
A good McDonalds to be fair.",1
Quikly and Scure option near Saralago Suites on Kissemme. A classic option for children and th,1
"We came here twice during our visit to the area. The first day, I would have given them 5 stars; the service was fantastic and, despite being extremely busy, they gave great attention to each guest. The second time, however, we came through the drive through and the service was terrible. It was very early in the morning, there were only a few other cars in line (maybe 3 in front of us?) and we were in line for at least 15 minutes.",1
Employee was rude but it fine 占쏙,1
Kind of touch and go with this location. Sometimes they're very attentive and sometimes they don't listen when you're trying to give them your order. Late night is when I've generally had problems with their service. Otherwise they are pretty good.,1
"Always a favorite, McD's is still serving up all the favorites - we were there for breakfast and had a short wait. Alas, no dining room availability at this location for now. Very reasonable prices, of course, and some delicious NEW breakfast pastries!",1
Normally I would give this restaurant five stars but today service was really slow. I placed an order for two Egg McMuffins & a large french vanilla coffee. My wait time was approximately 10 minutes. I also believe on this particular day the restaurant was understaffed. Again usually this restaurant is a five-star McDonald's just not on this day.,1
"First time I had been to a McDonald's in America. It's certainly nothing special, but there isn't anything wrong with the location.

Food was fine and it was cool to try the different items from the menu. Also, yes, french fries taste the same whether you buy them from the UK or America.",1
"I will admit this was a first at this location as it is always so busy when I arrived there was a line almost out to the street and this is a double drive through was worried I would be there a while but only took about ten mins as they moved quick and to my surprise my fries were fresh and hot. Best fries I have had in a while. Also got a cheeseburger and I must admit I was also pleased as I hate it when I decide to actually eat 1,000 calories and my cheese is thrown in my hamburger and not even melted yucky. But all was right on this last time. Good cheez burg& 占쏙",1
"I love this place, I've been to this place for year's and not even one time a worker has been rude to me.",1
I visited this location during the morning rush. The store was clean and the staff was very punctual. My son and I received our food within 1 minute after ordering. This location looks as if it was recently updated and it includes a playland for the little ones. Based off of today's experience I would recommend this location to anyone visiting.,1
"Just stopped by my local McDonald's to pick up some breakfast items before going to work. The 78th Street Tampa Florida branch is always on their mark, quick efficient usually correct with my order of hot tasty food. I can't believe how much I've been eating at McDonald's the last 3 years after many many years of barely ever going there since I was a teenager in the 1970s. Food is definitely better than it used to be, and I love getting deals with their online phone app and food questionnaires for freebies from the receipts.",1
"The food is always on the meh side. Luke warm, never hot and fresh even when it's busy and the employees are typically miserable.",1
New interior looks great. This location has the new digital ordering computers. The food came quickly and the staff were helpful. Only downside was that one of the card readers was broken and it wasn't marked,1
"Excellent location with a large playground and plenty of seating for adults. The food is your typical McDonald's fare with nothing special to write about. They have a large parking lot, and the bathrooms were clean during my visit. My only recommendation would be for the managers and employees to meet up behind the restaurant or in the break room instead of right in front of one of the main doors of the restaurant. It made the place look like a corner store and cheapens the image of this brand. Their service was top notch and although they were packed during this visit the food came out fresh and without any delays.",1
"This McDonald's was excellent,  the staff was courteous and professional and although all I ordered was coffee, it was delicious just as I have come to expect from most of the McDonald's I have been to.

It is comforting to be able to expect consistency from a restaurant,  no matter where I go in America,  so far, there is a better than 90% chance that the coffee, for example,  will be the same thing I am use to and desire.",1
It can get tight getting inside when there's a delivery truck next to the store. Most especially when you're going towards the drive-thru 占쏙,1
The workers are pleasant and the food here is always hot and good.,1
"Quick service, accurate follow up",1
"They had a broken latte machine.  The kiosk already had our CC deposit.  It took very long to receive our CC refund because the manager had to perform the business, and the restaurant was overly crowded.  They used to make great cappuccinos, but it got to be too loud, and those machines broke more frequently than lattes'.",1
This is one of the busiest McDonald's I have ever seen. Very modern inside. Most people were getting food to go so there was plenty of room to sit but so many people waiting for food. At least it was very fresh!,1
40 chicken nuggets and 2 large fries for 15 bucks!! Also the ice tea is the best in Florida,1
"Food and service was good , but not enough  working personal",1
Great workers were very helpful. Eating area play area were clean. Men's bathroom was quite messy and the toilet paper holder was torn off the wall. Overall will come again.,1
"OH EM GEE! BEST MCDONALDS IVE EVER BEEN TO.. MAKE A REQUEST FOR A WORKER NAMED MEGAN, SHES THE SWEETEST AND SO KIND. GREATLY HONORED TO HAVE GOTTEN THE EXPERIENCE TO GO HERE! ",1
We ordered through the app and we just went up said our order number and our order was ready by the time we got to the window and nothing was missing! Fantastic service!,1
Very clean and it taste as usual,1
"I frequent the drive thru here quite often and since their update the speed of service has increased.

Even though I am trying  to eat healthier these days I just can't stay away from my all time favorite Egg McMuffin. These ladies and gentleman are always fast and friendly  with a delicious sandwich.",1
The ice cream machine was actually working at this store. Drive thru speaker was hard to hear. No wait and quick service.,1
"Not from Florida..but every McDonald's I visited in this area was some of the best experiences you could ask for. Nice people. Fast fresh food. Super fun play areas, no complaints whatsoever.",1
Nice place to eat anytime you want. They are very busy. People come by the bus loads to eat hamburgers all over. It's a tourist trap. Cheap and hot food. Your money goes far. Most people go there for a quick meal and internet which is free.,1
Food was fine but line at drive thru was slow possibly because girl working window was more interested in texting then waiting on customers,1
It's a good place for fast food,1
The line for drive thru was out to the street! Not their fault it is not the first time. Once I got to pay point it was quick.,1
"If this is the location next to Old Town, I love it. My food was fresh and everybody read accommodating ",1
"Probably the fastest Mc Donald in the area. I saw a big line of cars, but spent less than 10 minutes until I left the place. Even inside the attention via the se",1
Food was good don't like self order screens,1
Great location friendly service pleasant staff!! Our food was delivered fast and hot. I ordered coffee and it came out just as expected! Hot and delicious!,1
"Truly one of the best Mc Donald's I've every been to! Best fries, the Big Mac actually looked like the photos you see! Being close to Disney, this location clearly works hard to make a great impression on tourists and it shows.",1
"The place was clean, the washroom stalls needs repairs and it was clean but smells like urine big time. Staff are friendly and helpful. Thanks, Rick Stasiuk, Wetaskiwin Alberta Canada T9A 3R2",1
"This particular McDonalds across from Old Town, is a hit or miss and I went to try the new chicken strips as an entre with my #4 chicken sandwich meal.  Before I left the lot from the drive through I checked everything.... The strips needed more cook time ""my opinion"" so I brought them inside and made the request.... Now it's McDonald's... you should expect some kickback or something but to my surprise I was really shocked and amazed that the order lady took it, told the M.O.D. and he says he can take care of it, he just needed about 5mins I told him no problem and waited. Now when I did receive it, he made sure he gave it to me, and when I got home to my surprise added an extra strip! 4 of 5 stars because the chicken sandwich was very delicious and the service blew me away but the strips I just didn't like.",1
"Today Monday December 19 , 2016 This McDonald's Restaurant Has A Wonderful Services The Employees Name Is Miss Caprice & Very Happy & So Sweet & Very Helpful Food Is So Good The Morning Breakfast & The Hot Coffee & Ice Coffee Awesome The Big Breakfast Just Love It & They Have A Play Area For Your Kids To Run Around Fantastic Idea & Great Job McDonald's Restaurant Putting A Play Area For The Children To Play Around Perfect My 100% I Will Definitely Give You !!",1
We were visiting Orlando and I needed coffee. Service was fast. Staffs were friendly. The sausage biscuit taste like freezer. The coffee was good.,1
"Cleaness McDonald's, friendly attentive staff!",1
"Read down place has changed a lot! Getting to be excellent place to go!

Not good, new construction is nice. But understaffed. Even at 2-3am you can walk in and find over half of the tables covered with trays and garbage. Also the floors heavily littered. Yes you are supposed to buss your own table at a fast food restaurant, but alot of foreign/domestic vacationers are just filthy. They just drop food and wrappers everywhere. When they are done eating they just get up and leave.
Host/busser is needed for the dining area for the sloppy pigs. More register coverage for the guests. When a crowd of people have to go through one register while the kitchen staff waits for orders is inefficient.
I have had 2-3 errors in my 8 visits. First one was when they put extra mustard on burger instead of adding mayo. Second was they ran out of hot fudge and instead of telling me they used the coffee chocolate topping for my Sunday's (yes 2 of them).
I caught the first error quickly and was easily fixed properly by management before I left. The 2nd error wasn't caught till we where eating the Sunday's at home. I took one back as proof of the error to get a refund. At first they only wanted to refund one but with several minutes of bickering they refunded both. Yeah it was only $1 and some change but it was the principal.
I walk to and from the restaurant since I have no car it is about one mile away from my home. I always request 2 plastic bag's for my food because the one paper bag they put my 6-8 burgers fails halfway home. The 2nd one is for the 3 Sunday's.

Another epic failure, ordered 2 mcdouble no mustard and onions. 2 bacon mcdouble  and 2 mcdouble regular. Received the 2 mcdouble wo/mustard and onions no problem. 2 bacon mcdouble had no bacon and no mustard fail. 2 regular mcdouble had no mustard either fail. 2 large fries ordered and received 2 medium sized fries and 2 of the smallest sized fries I've ever seen (guess they where kids sized) fail. The 20 peice fry came without incident. Less than 1/2 of the whole order came correctly....
7/16
Getting better and better, the manager Monique she runs a tight ship. Every time I'm in and she is there every thing is smooth sailing. A great thank you for your great service Monique!
7/18
Wow place was packed! Was able to wait just a short time and got my order. Looked around and yep there she was Monique steadily coordinating the staff! Must of been 30+ people in line only 5 min wait. Later I saw her again in the lobby assisting a guest with her drinks, both with smile's on.",1
"This Mcdonald was very clean, the employee was so respectful I enjoyed eating here. The restroom was clean I actually allowed my little one use the restroom without worrying. The play house full of kids and very playful",1
I had an order that was wrong. I went back the next morning and the manager gladly fix the mistake he was very professional very kind and I love this McDonald's I eat here almost every morning. It is a very good location the managers are very professional and friendly and I highly recommend this McDonald's above almost any other I've been to,1
I've been at this location a couple times. Definitely a faster service compared with the ones i've visited so far. The lady at the drive thru seem like she actually cared so that's always a plus,1
"I had a great experience here. It's a very high traffic store but kids pretty clean, the staff was helpful and we got our food in less than 10 minutes after ordering from the kiosk.",1
I always go out of my way to go to this McDonald's they always make their french fries right well the way I like them the food is always hot service is always good looks like they're taking all covid precautions I recommend this one across from old Town,1

"One of the better McDonalds.  Fast, accurate, clean.",1
"I love McDonalds.  Been in my life all my life.  No bigger disappointment than waiting for my meal and getting lukewarm fries.  This one gave me lukewarm fries after I waited 15 minutes for my meal.  I hold McDonalds to a very high standard and, for me, the fries make the meal.  No exception!!",1
Breakfast was good and the meals were delivered to the window accurately.,1
"Very clean and well organized McDonald's.  McDonald's even has an indoor play area for kids, with a slide. I would highly recommend eating here on a rainy vacation day to allow your children a chance run off a little energy.",1
"I have an 8 year old lady, a 7 year old and a 3 year old. Mickey D's is apart of their life whether i like it or not, and its convenient. So chicken nugget me to death.",1
"Been to this location several times, only problem is the amount of time waiting for food for dining in & take out orders..... Always made food according to order.... Friendly staff, kind service. Kiosk could use work as the mcpick 2 is not on it and u will pay regular prices if not careful!!!! Otherwise, great!!!",1
This McDonald was very very good got me what I want and got it quickly I went to another McDonald's on South Orange Blossom Trail and it was a worst experience I've ever had I speak Spanish and you Spanish people that are absolutely racist and didn't want to even help me I don't know what the problem is but I don't think they should be working there what state was they were making saying nasty things about me in Spanish I understood what they said because I speak Spanish that you didn't know that,1
Food was fresh and hot and actually looked like a burger should definitely better better than what we get back home in GA,1

Very fast and efficient and the manager was very friendly despite the location being under construction.,1
"Keith was by far the best fast food employee I have ever come in contact with. He was so generous and helpful, truly deserves a promotion.",1
Nice food and nice play place,1
"Fast service, nice play area. Clean store. The manager was out cleaning tables and asking if we needed anything. Play area had some broken equipment, but overall it was one of the best experiences at McDonalds.",1
"An awesome McDonald's restaurant that serves food properly prepared,  quickly,  and at the appropriate temperature. This location has that McCafe remodel so it features comfortable niche seating,  charging ports for your tech, and other similar comforts that encourage you to stay and relax for a few minutes.",1
Service was fast but quality of food was disappointing on both trips,1
Amazing! The best McDonald's food I've ever had. Missing food I had to go back for but well worth it. The food made it okay. I didn't mind the inconvenience.,1
"Very modern McDonald's, you have a kiosk where you can order and they brink your food to you. They also have a nice pkayplace for kids which looked new and we'll thought out with touchscreen computers for older kids. Very nice!",1

Delicious hamburgers that definitely weigh on your belly on your way to bed and if you want to take a quick nap on a full belly  McDonald's is the place to go,1

Good prices for large diet coke and ice cream cone.,1
It was very crowded but the service was fast and the food was fresh.,1
Only place open late on a week night so the wait time was extremely long.,1
"Great place to have a cup of coffee. If you are on the keto diet, McDonald's has whipped butter. Yes it's real butter. Along with half and half. You could ask for whipped cream. Believe me there coffee tastes much better with butter  and cream in it .  They do not have Stevia . They can make you a keto breakfast. Which is eggs bacon and sausage layered.",1
Fancy on the inside. Food was what you,1
They're not bad. So far I've never had them get an order wrong,1
For pure volume pretty darn efficient. Clean too all things considered.Use auto order screens. Faster. Didn't try drive thru,1
Very clean.  Attentive staff.  As always reliable and delicious food.,1
"My cousin assumed that we wanted 2 apple slices and 1 go-gurt, but we quickly changed to 1apple slice and 2 go-gurts, but they gave us what we first ordered. The food was rrreeeaaalllyyy ggoodd though! Mmm mmm mmm.",1

They didn't make sure my order was complete. I found that out when I arrive to my hotel room.,1
My food was hot and fresh and the restaurant was clean.,1
Great but can be very busy in the drive through.,1
Love that you can pay in an automatic machine. We need that here like ya!,1
We ordered at the online till in the restaurant and had a lovely meal.,1

"Hot food and quick service.  Playground with too many kids, make it too noisy.",1
"Another aspect that adds to the appeal of McDonald's is the affordability. The menu prices are generally budget-friendly, making it an attractive option for individuals or families looking for a quick and affordable meal. The availability of value meals and combo deals further enhances the value for money.",1
Love it!   When they know my grandson is there for his,1
"I went to this Mcdonld's before the gym.  They have a 2 lane drive through , but there is plenty of seating inside.  I ordered the spicy crispy chicken sandwich, the 10 piece nuggets, the fish sandwich and a large iced tea.  Overall the meal is good.  I wish Mcdonald's had more grilled chicken options.  But the meal is quick and cheap.  It got the job done for a good pre workout. The ordering process is kiosk here at this location, so you can wait in line or use the kiosk.  Overall good",1
"My fries were salted, they didn't put pickle on my Burger as asked, and it was a quick drive thru experience. I'd say not too bad",1
No problems or complaints whatsoever with this McDonald's in particular. The only thing  I'll say and I think is every single McDonald's same problem is  with the ice-cream machines.,1
"Very nice and helpful drive thru staff. They noticed a problem with my order before I did, and they fixed it.",1
Best McDonald! Great cust,1
This is a fine McDonald's. Clean and friendly staff and restaurant. Seems newly renovated but no kids play area. Outdoor seating is very pleasant.,1
I placed a mobile order to go before I picked up my granddaughter and her friend from middle school. They are always starving after school. Minnie brought my order to the car. I had ordered frozen coke but they didn't have it so she asked me what drink I'd prefer. She also told me to come by and ask for her and she would make it right for me.,1
There always fast and has my order ready,1
"The manager in the morning is awesome, the older Hispanic woman at the front counter gives exceptional customer service, you can tell she genuinely likes her job and is happy. Food was hot and fresh, and the coffee was just right. Will definitely come back to this one!",1
"I usually go to this location, mostly as drive thru. Never have a problem with food, service or wait. This last visit went with the family a group of 7. And order inside the lobby was clean, the staff was friendly. The gentleman that took our order failed to charge as a large meal so we got a medium and when an item in our order was missing Minerva quickly corrected the error. In addition Minerva walked around the lobby checking in on guests including us. That",1
"Typical McDonald's restaurant. Clean, relatively new facility with a friendly, well-trained staff. Ample parking available and very easy access/egress for both North and South bound Semoran Blvd/SR436.",1
The line on the drive through is very slow and long. So i decided to go inside. It is friday night. On the door states lobby open untill 12am. They have the doors locked and guys dancing and clowning around. One of them opens the door and tells me they can not take orders in the lobby that drive through is the only way. I asked him may i speak to the shift manager. So he went off and came with one of the guys. Not the manager. He said that the owner of the McDonald's closes early. I recommend people to go elsewhere and not here. Is not worth the time.,1
"With all the issues that almost every business is experiencing...major shortages of both food and employees.. McDonald's seems to be the only place that has managed to keep it all together and do things right! Employees at this location are always efficient, professional and pleasant.",1
"Went through the drive through, nothing to complain about. But you can tell that the people who work there do not want to be there. Too many fast food places in this area are like that though. Maybe if they got paid a livable wage they'd be happier. Maybe they deserve to be treated like human beings too? Yeah I think so!",1
"Joseph is a good employee they should give him a raise cause he told me how much 200 chicken nuggets are so that why he should get a raise.

P.S he was a good sport I di",1
"Good service Area is bot the best , but they are open late. Quick service and food is done in time,  ppl are pretty nice.",1
Today visit was awful. Food was stiff and luke warm and was missing some items  when I asked for it to be remade Joann the manger argue with me about it. I shouldnt have to argue to get hot food I paid for. Im back to update my review I originally gave my visit a 1 star. I got an email from Bre Williams the general manger she invited my family back and insured this is not how her store operates. Showing care for the customer goes along way. Thank Mrs. Williams for reaching out .,1
The workers were incredibly friendly and accommodating and the atmosphere was nice with cute little stools. The digital ordering was a little confusing but overall it was a lovely experience for a McDonald's. Food was good and it hit the spot ,1
For fast food this McDonald's is better then average. I think it is probably due to the staff. There is a young girl named Carissa on the Am shift who is excellent. She sees us come in the door and has started our coffee ( we always stop on the way to work). She runs around the restaurant ' topping' off your coffee . We always know when she is working the restaurant is neat and clean. Thanks Carissa for starting our day off with a smile,1
"Went through the drive thru a few days ago, had the car in front of me take the food I paid for, so they had to make my stuff again. I waited a little bit but got fresh food. I퐉 giving a 5 st",1
"My home Mcmunch always there to solve my cheeseburger deficiency. 436&1792
IYKYK",1
The first day the McRib came out I went inside purchased two of them to go to find out when I got home there was hardly too little barbecue sauce on it. So the next day I went to talk to the manager she was very polite and apologized and made it up I replacing the two MC ribs that were fantastic so thank you for making it right bump bump bump.,1
Wanted a quick bite so I picked up their 2 for $6 dollars mix and match items from their menu,1
"I'll ordered cappuccino but the machine was being cleaned. Ordered 2 sm coffee w cream on the side. Got coffee, cream already in it and not very hot. They had us pull frwd. When the came out, they gave us 2 med coffee w cream on the side.",1
"The MacDonald restaurants has served the best quality fast food for all ages for many years. For the last 20 years I have purchase the chicken nuggets and the consistency and flavor of the nuggets have not changed, they are just right all the time. Epifania, my 90 years old sister love the French Fry and the Grill Chicken Sandwich. Every time she has them she said  ""There is a whole chicken in this sandwich"" ""It is good for a lunch or dinner.""
Congratulation to McDonald!!",1
"In the morning this McDs is so fast, so friendly and always gets the order right. They don't add something I didn't ask for. The hash browns are always crisp and hot.  When I say light ice they comply.  Thanks morning crew.",1
I take advantage of the buy one get one breakfast sandwiches. Definitely worth saving your receipts!,1
The perfect example of what a McDonald's can be. Food was hot and fresh and made to perfect spec. Curbside pickup took under 3 minutes. Good work!,1
"Really like this McDonald's , it's got a double drive through which is nice , fast service and luckily haven't had any issues with their ice cream machine being down 占쏙",1
We just went through the drive through at the McDonald on 436 and 17-92. Once again it proves to be our favorite. Vonelle read back our order to make sure and had the ,1
This place is good for a quick bite but if going through drive through make sure to check order before leaving. They usually get something wrong or forget to put something in your order.,1
The food at this store is always done right. They seem to run a good kitchen. Things are served at the right temp and 99% of the time taste great. Unlike other stores where you've got about a 60% chance of great food.,1
Definitely very good service. I love the Christian music. Very nice and clean. Always love eating inside. I give a 10 star rating. Even higher than 10 as far as I'm concerned. ,1
"It's McDonald's not much to say.
Service was pretty fast.",1
"This McDonald's, is a McDonald's that we've been frequenting on Wednesdays, we go after dinner, for a little desert with a fairly large group, and we had an excellent experience with a cashier, very friendly and was quick to ensure we had everything we needed. I normally get the turtle brownie sundae, a very delicious treat.",1
"Employees were great, food was good",1
Fast and friendly they have no problem giving us extra mayonnaise and salt and pepper. My boyfriend mom always gets no salt because she can't have it and every time they make sure no salt,1
For a McDonald's this place is good.  The staff for the most part are friendly and helpful.  The parking lot and drive-through are well designed.  I also like the fact that this location is open 24 hours.,1
"Shamrock shakes are the best things in the world, I can't resist. I hate fast food but damn, I need these green frozen milk cups of joy. I'm certainly glad that they are not available for too long, I'd be 400 pounds! AND this McD's is open 24 hours a day, how evil!",1
Lines were long even at 7pm but food was hot at this location and they don't skim on the ice cream cones,1
"Cleanest McDonald's I've had the pleasure of stopping in, in a long time.  Friendly people, manager is on top of her game.  #impressed",1

"Stopped for nuggets and for once they were fresh. Usually, they're out of the cabinet and have been there well past the discard time, but that's the norm for most McDonalds.",1

"I went at lunch time and ordered my meal and sat down at a chair. they actually brought my food out to me at the table, which I was blown away. I didn't realize they did that at McDonalds. it was a very pleasant experience.",1
"Place is very clean, friendly. The food was ready very quick. Nice place workers very helpful and giving.",1

"This McDonald's looks like a McDonald's should. It's a good McDonald's. Great, even. Good food, too.

Built in 1989, this McDonald's is true McDonald's quality, whatever that is. Good service. Good-quality food. Clean interior. Modern on the inside, classy on the outside. Perfectly balanced, as McDonald's should be.",1

For the size of the building and play facilities in this McDonald's it's the biggest and the best. If you're looking for customer service not a chance.  You're better off using the kiosks and have patience waiting for your order. I'll recommend this place for the experience only and works with your children.,1
Nice place for kids to grab quick fries! Close to Hilton Orlando. Just a walking distance if you need something. Next to them there,1
The manager at this store is absolutely outstanding . They just reintroduced the steak bagel and I said what can I change the bread to a McGriddle and she did that without a single question. I even went as far as to ask her if I have the round egg instead of the folded and she jumped right to it and that was fantastic. Try it sometime it's wonderful thank you very much and God bless.,1
I put in an order for in-store pickup but didn't realize that the dining room closed at 12. The store manager Emma and the rest of the staff were super accommodating and allowed us into the building and got us our food very quickly. Great customer service!,1
Ordered thru the app which was a quick and easy process. Mcflurry and shakes were broken and unavailable at the time of visit. Parked in curbside pickup as drive through line was long. Quickly and accurately received my order.,1
"Friendly, fast service.  Kiosks made it easy to place your order.  The food was delicious and hot.  Very busy location, but hardly no wait. The dining area was nice and clean.",1
Always friendly staff. Fairly clean and food to order. Shout out to all workers and managers!,1
We visited this while on a vacation to Orlando with our team. What an experience. There's a lot of different food options including PIZZA! The place is amazing. If you are ever in or near the Orlando area it is absolutely worth the time to stop in and see this place. Unbelievable.,1
"Great Mcdonalds! Really love the clean store, the big mac is delicious and so are the breakfast items and chicken nuggets. The convention is right here so there are a lot of tourists but they have a self serve kiosk that helps to speed up taking orders. Highly recommend this store if you're in the area. The service is nice and there are plenty of places to sit down to eat. Be careful leaving the parking lot though as international drive (the road) is pretty interesting at times. In conclusion, I rate this McDonald's 5/5 and I hope to be back soon to take out more food to do mukbangs.",1
Right place at the right time. It was a wonderful drive thru experience & right choice given those inside. Very busy in Orlando but food was fresh & exactly what I needed going back to Tampa!,1
Fast and friendly service. The food was hot and we ordered through the app which saved time. Customer service was amazing!,1
"Tried ordering at the drive thru but the manager that was helping the drive thru operator apparently is unaware of the current bogo $1 promotion.. told me I had to order 2 to get the promotion (?) so had to go inside and order thru the totens to be able to place my order including the promotion. Besides that, all clean, food was good and service inside was outstanding.",1
"Most interesting McDonald that I퐒e ever been. It features a fish tank, an arcade and serves pizza and pastas. Great place to visit as it is very unusual and interesting. However do avoid going there past 10:30pm as it go",1
"Good food good service and delivered quickly, I must admit I am a fan of the milkshakes and apple pie",1
The food was served fast but the time in the drive thru was very long. It is clean and friendly staff.,1
Cool place to visit. Workers were very rude and got multiple orders wrong while we were there.,1
Quick pop through the drive-thru for a cold drink after visiting Fun Spot. Frozen coke products are amazing and so was the cinnamon roll!,1
"When you're hungry, almost anything tastes good. Thankfully, their food was fully cooked, unlike other locations.",1
Food came out really fast and on point. Games were very affordable $5 for 30 min of play. Will definitely come back. Kids 6 and 9 loved the experience!,1
"This is the world's biggest McDonald's and has several options not available anywhere else, like oven bake pizza and pasta. Also, the dessert section has gelato and cakes",1
"Dream,this place was amazing,I mean the food was expensive but really good and the arcade had amazing games but unfortunately the prize room was closed cuz of COVID but this was a good experience",1
"Friendliest service I have ever experienced. The Coffee tastes great.

Could even use their phone for a car rental call since my car broke down.
Also it is very clean, during my waiting time of 4 hours they cleaned the tables several times.

I fully recommend to visit this place.",1
Quick and easy using the order yourself tower. Fish ole sandwich was delicious. Thank you.,1
The biggest Macdonald I ever saw! They are selling pizza as well,1
Nice stop after Disney World. I did like it better before they remodeled...,1
It was very loud and crowded with kids goofing off and yelling. Totally bad. Can't even eat inside around the after school time....,1
"It is a very nice place and the service is great, the taste of the food is different from other McDonald's in my opinion.",1
"This location offers pizza, pasta, and more. It has an arcade on the 2nd floor that acts as the play area. This McDonald's is the largest McDonald's and is close to both amusement parks. Therefore, it will always be a go-to stop for me on vacation. The pizza at McDonald's is freshly baked to perfection by a McPit Master",1
"Everything was great!  Food was good and fresh.  Place was clean.  All the employees were very nice to us and attentive.  Especially Patrick on the second floor, he was amazing.  Kept everything clean the whole time, ask us how we were a few time and was very kind and polite the whole time, and takes very seriously his duties.  Me and my kids enjoy our time a lot.",1
Little more expensive than your average McDonalds but I suppose that is to be expected due to the location. One nice benefit is that they do accept the coupons in the McDonald's app.,1
"This place was amazing!  Had fish tanks, it made pasta!  It was so quick, everyone was very friendly.  It had a whole upper level for kids to play, and was ao clean!!!",1
"Average mcdonalds. They get the order right 9 out of 10 times, which is a good success rate in my experience.",1
Who doesn love a Mcdonald had a late breakfast ie a big mac and massive coffee ou,1
We were looking for a certain happy meal toy to complete our collection and Emma was nice enough to help us and even search for it! It really made our night and she was awesome! Update: this is the 9814 International Dr location,1
The guy that works the window taking orders is hilarious and nice. I think his name is Sidel. He is an amazing person and made our night in the short encounters we had.,1
"Fairy fast service considering how busy this location was. Could have been a little cleaner. Food was good, but unfortunately certain items that are only available their menu were not available when we went. Large inside playground and has a arcade.",1
"Hello everyone.  First, I have to say that I have not been to McDonald's in forever!! With that being said,  I went through the drive thru because I didn't want to get out.  The young man who took my order was kind,  that was the first window.  2nd window,  a whole other story.  Drive up, and right off the bat, this young lady looks mad that she is even working.  You know,  at least fake that you are Blessed to even have a job.  I was scared to ask her for a cup holder, but I did any way,  lol.  I had the BigMac Meal and remember like I said I had not been in forever.... I DEVOURED THAT BIG MAC, it Was fresh, and so were the fries. I also had a Fish sandwich.  So yes I recommend.",1
"Excellent customer service, fresh food and juice. Recommend!",1
We went drive through this location and had a good experience.,1
"Great experience! The food was great but the real experience was the customer service. Destiny was super helpful and even overheard us talking about asking for extra syrup for the pancakes and went and got it for us without us even having to ask. Customer service sometimes seems like a thing of the past but not at this McDonald's. Also, when I spoke to the manager about the great experience he was very nice as well. Great McDonald's! All McDonald's should be modeled after this one. Thank you guys!!!",1
"The manager who i believes named chandler and one of the chashiers named Que where both amazing and made this experience unforgettable. If you퐎e looking for a 24 hour place to eat you found it! The food was great, quick ",1
Food hot and good. Excellent service.,1
Love the new ordering system. From using the easy to use order point to our food arriving it was less than 5 minutes. Only with we could get mcgriddles in the UK!,1
Celebrating my daughter 10th birthday by nearby hotel. Lunch was perfect with the game room/pla,1
"Our little one was having a pretty rough morning and Ms. Maria stepped in and went above and beyond to try to make her happy. Margot ended up smiling and dancing and even ended up passing out a few high fives! Ms. Maria made all of our days better. Thank you for bringing a smile to our faces. The location service was prompt, our order from the kiosk was accurate, and the food was well prepared. Clean location and restrooms at 10:00am on a Thursday.",1
"Had a pleasant trip here with my 5 year old. On vacation from Indiana and compared to any McDonald's there this is like a fine dining restaurant lol clean, food was fresh, tomatoes where not mushy which brings me to believe they actually don't freeze there's like back at home. Had two managers walking around the restaurant actually working instead of being in the backroom 'doing paperwork' five stars definitely will be returning before we go back home.",1
"My family and I stopped in here for a quick breakfast on our way home from a mini vacation.

I ordered the oatmeal and a hash brown.

An employee Nlnamed TJ brought our food to our table. I noticed I didn't have the apple chunks and raisins that come with the oatmeal. I let her know she went back and brought me what I needed.

I then noticed the hash brown I ordered wasn't on the tray either.
I let her know and she apologized, then comes back with not one but 2 hash browns, which oddly enough my young child decided after we got our food that she did want a hashbrown now. She comped a free hashbrown.
She was such a pleasant person to deal with.  Her customer service and customer care abilities are 20/10

I over heard he saying to another customer that this location isn't her usual location and she is a General Manager.

She took care of evryone around us, with an amazing attitude and a smile on her face, which is a rare occasion.

I hope she gets the recognition she deserves, and a promotion or raise. She turned a typically frustrating situation and made it a pleasant one. It's funny to think that I we left happy even though our order was messed up.",1
"Love their new chicken tenders, it's about time McD's start picking up their game!",1
"We stopped on the way home for a late night snack and drinks for our ride home.
Food as expected, friendly service, outside looked clean.",1
We only went through the drive through.,1
The employees were very nice!,1
Visiting from out of town. I was very impressed with the manager Stephanie. She really stood out to me today because she was working very hard and every customer that came her way she made sure she assisted them with out rushing them even though they were very busy. She also took the time to pick up in lobby to keep the inside looking good. Thanks for that experience today Step!,1
"Always call here after visiting Seaworld. It's half the price of the food in Seaworld. We order on the App before we leave, and it is brought to our vehicle 5 minutes after we arrive, nice and hot. My orders have been 100% accurate since using the App vs the drive through.",1
"Breana on the amusements kiosk has made our evening, giving her time to explain loading the amusement cards up, really kind and helpful and nothing was rushed or too much trouble, my children (5&2) really loved her and all the way home said how nice she was.

We've had bad experiences in this mcdonalds (long waits for happy meals etc) but i think she easily changed those for us today.
I hope she gets recognised for how good she's been.",1
"Good service, tucked away",1
"This place is amazing, clean place, nice employees and they have updated there technology. I",1
"The place immaculate, place your order at the kiosk, pick up a number and it was brought to your table. The attendant was very helpful and friendly.",1
Some of the negative reviews I'm seeing might be for other I-Drive locations. This one on the south end located near Sea World is always pretty good. It's a well run establishment and seems a little more upscale than the others in the area. Service is friendly although a bit on the slow side on my most recent visit but the Drive Thru was packed as this was on a Saturday night during a busy time of season in Orlando.,1
"Updated review 2022: This really is a great McDonald's. Maybe if you don't appreciate it, you haven't been around. The grounds are clean, I saw the manager (Chris) picking up trash around the store. They wear nice uniforms and there was an employee cleaning tables as soon as they were vacant. A very nice lady on morning shift was bringing orders TO THE TABLE ya'll. It was much busier at night so a longer wait but considering there are dozens of hotels nearby, I think service is pretty fast. (2019 Review) I went here three times during my stay in the area and the food was always hot, place clean and staff prompt and courteous. Got a fabulous greeting Memorial Day morning.",1
"It's a busy McDonald's in the morning based on its location, however, their service is good and fast. Great place to dine in.",1
Order was accurate and tasted great. Fast service. They were out of some items so had to change our order slightly.,1
"Ordered two plain fish sandwiches with no cheese or  tartar sauce, due to a dairy allergy. When I got to the pick up window - they had put slices of cheese in both sandwiches. I returned them and had to sit and wait for the order to be corrected.  Unfortunately, this happens constantly, no matter what McDonald's I go too. It's clear the prep team simply isn't paying attention to the instructions on the orders.",1
Love this place,1
"Very modern McDonald's, plenty of self service kiosks, drive through is efficient and they even have a patio so you can eat outside. They also have table service!
Place was very clean too and the soda machine had dozens and dozens of combinations.",1
My family and i had come to Orlando for the weekend only so since Sunday morning we were ti head back to Miami. We wanted ti get ahead of the traffic so we decided that we would order breakfast and eat as we traveled and McDonald's was our spot. The lines were long but it moved pretty fast and we were happy. I dont get ti eat breakfast out very often so this was a treat for me ad the food was great.,1
Tgey forgot us at the curbside pickup. 30 mins,1
Friendly staff. Clean restaurant,1
They where A 1 they where closing & still let us come in & served us all & it was a lot of us & served us like we where they 1st customers & alllll food was hot ,1
"Visited a few days after Christmas, it was a quick walk from our  hotel. Considering the amount of people that were ordering, our food came out quick. They forgot some items and they were very apologetic and got the rest of our order right away.",1
Fries and nuggets were hot and fresh.  I got the family share about 40 nuggets 40 nuggets and 2 large fries. Plus the 20% off with mobile app. Great deal.,1
"We had breakfast this morning and was greeted by a manager in a suit who helped us place our order on the kiosk. Our hot fresh food was brought to our table by a friendly associate. While we ate I couldn help but notice a manager holding doors for customers and assisting where needed, even window washing. A male associate asked if he could take our tray when we were finished. The staff is impressive and the remodel looks refreshing",1
"McDonald's is my favorite restaurant of all. My dad or mom always order something we like. Mine is the double cheeseburger with no pickles. In Saturdays and mostly Fridays, we get those burgers for dinner. Like to see McDonald's keeping up the good work!",1
The manager here always is very accommodating and always makes sure that the place is clean.,1
"Best McDonalds in the area. Great coffee, modern decor, clean. Wifi. Quickest service. Friendly and helpfull staff.",1
I personally haven't had any issues with this location. In the 2 years I've lived close by there have been 2 times where the drive through was majorly backed up and something was clearly wrong. But of maybe 100 trips in the last few years I've had 95% good service and fresh food.,1
They have a arcade and place to play for kids of all ages staff swerves you and very helpful definitely my go to place when In Florida,1
"This McDonalds is a sight to see!! If you퐎e in Orlando, take y",1
"The nicest workers I have ever met! The main lady, I didn catch her name, but she was so friendly and helped my family order on their touch screens and she was so nice and helpful.  It is refreshing to meet someon",1
Good hot food.  A bit of a wait for a McMuffin at 6:30am.  Nobody else in line at the drive thru.  They had to ask the chicken for more eggs?,1
We stopped at McDonald just for drinks. It seems they were low on ice and ,1
"Very nice, clean establishment. The staff was efficient and worked diligently to provide for our every need. My family and I are visiting from out of town. We noticed that the employees, even the store manager walked throughout the restaurant checking on customers making sure they are enjoying their food. I greatly appreciate the atmosphere they provide for their customers.",1
"Busy, busy, busy.  Prepare for a wait!

Location is good. Restaurant is clean.  Employees are nice. Orders are accurate.  Ordering Keosks are cool.  Well laid out & up to date . . . but prepare to wait.  This place is busy beyond repair.  Drive through stacked (at least 9 cars waiting with both wait stalls full.  For the last hour, 8+ people lined up inside with 2 of the 4 kiosks in use.  Prepare for minimum 30 minutes inside.",1
Food was decent. Cashier had difficulties with card in drive thru saying machine was asking for pin. Odd. Large order but smoothies three quarters of way filled. Filled but looked like ice and concentrate added. They did remake it which turned out fine.,1
"Very clean, Inside and out. I order on my app and the food was waiting as I walked in. Everything was hot and fresh.",1
Good fast location. They had a third window for you to pull forward to keep the line moving through the drive thru instead of having someone walk out to your car. It was super convenient and it did seem to save time. We will probably stop by this location again before our trip it over. You can't really go wrong with $1 cheeseburgers.,1
"No wait in drive thru line. They got the order right. Fries were nice and hot and the staff was respectful. I did not five stars because the girl at the drive thru struggled to understand me, english was not her native language. She tried though and it all worked out. I got my correct order and in a timely manner.",1
"It is very clean inside, great staff. I always go inside and order take out. They do everything super fast.",1
The cleanest nicest McDonald's ever! The staff are so welcoming and helpful and great with the kids after a long tired day! Thank you.,1
We're here the other night about 2:00 a.m. they're very kind and considerate the fries were a little late so they offered me an extra set plus the ones that were not bad in my opinion but may have been a minute older so thanks to them and their service and tasty food,1
Had a slight issue ordering. Inform the manager that they're ordering system was not working right. They jumped on it right away to correct the problem with getting it involved. Super clean and friendly store.,1
"Nothing bad to say here! We grabbed some quick breakfast before heading to the parks. We opted to use the digital checkout to place our order which is pretty cool and gives plenty of options to what you order. It also seems to give you a little more time to order. The place was very clean and modern in design. We didn't interact too much with staff but the little we did, they seemed very nice and helpful. Although not used this time by us, I did notice a cart specifically for sauces, seasonings, etc right behind the counter for quick access when asked.. the location was pretty good despite being off a busy road so that didny pose any issues. Overall a pretty food McDonalds experience!",1
"Very nice staff, good place to get all your fast food needs!  Tha k you!  ",1
They have better food than the regular McDonald's because it's the largest in the u.s.,1
"I don normally review McDonald but this is a good one because of the staff right now.  You know what the food is like so no need to discuss, you either like it or you don.  There is a very sweet older lady that works here that is phenominal.  She likes her job, is nice to customers and actually makes this place great.  I will be back.  Thi",1
"Very busy usually, fresh hot food, fried typically don't have salt on them have been multiple times before with the same issue. Prices also higher than other mcdonalds, otherwise clean, friendly employees, fresh food",1
"I love that you could touch screen order,  it was easy, and there are people constantly cleaning! I love that they bring the food to the table as well! Very nice, wish I had one where I love! I think more people would enjoy dining in at McDonald's now!",1
No heavy traffic which means your food is made fresh and rarely sitting for too long. Would recommend over McDonald's entertainment location further up international drive where the prices are significantly higher.,1
Middle of the day and they were fast efficient and friendly the fries were hot everything was fresh,1
"Only used thr drive through, but order was correct and the food was good.  Busy unit given its location, but the flow through the two lanes was pretty swift.

Interactions with staff were efficient and pleasant.",1
"I never thought I would rate a McDonald's as 5 stars but I did. Food was typical of a McDonald's but the staff were truly incredible for a fast food restaurant. They smiled, checked up on us, cleaned up our tables and looked far more professional than the normal locations.",1
This place was freaking unbelievable!  It has a elevator that takes you up to the game room where all the fun begins.  The food was good. I had the broccoli and  Alfredo. I do recommend it.  The large fish tank in the middle of the floor,1
The friendliest mcdonalds staff I have ever met! Tasha was the sweetest worker there! The food was good and as isially good price. They had some fancy new machines that had to be 2019 machines I was lost and couldn't get a refill cause it made me anxious and they were busy! But overall good time okay food good people,1
Really nice place. Best McDonalds I've ever seen. Milkshake was good too.,1
Totally not the staff's fault but there was only 1 person to take orders from the double drive thru. There were also a few minor mistakes on our order but considering they barely had staff I expected it.,1
"Fires were ""pie pan"" hot and the chicken sangwich was pretty deece. Better than usual.",1
"I have visited multiple McDonalds, and I have never received a great customer service like in this location, by the management.  Great customer service, great attention, very respectfully.
They even walk bu your table to ask if everything was ok.",1
"Busy, but the line went pretty fast, but had a mix up on the order.",1
After travel around the world this is one of the best McDonald's. The Manager is super kind and has the best customer service ever.,1
"I realize it's fast food but I like it and go there 2-3 times per month. I always get a #4 chicken sandwich meal. I get a large drink and total comes to about 10 bucks. Maybe a little high but the sandwich makes it worth it. International Drive location in Myrtle Beach, SC.",1
"Took me and my husband and kids there. They loved the playground that was located upstairs. It was very Spacey.

Very busy here at night maybe a good 20 mins to get u food,1
"Although McDonald's chain is known for it great customer service and fast delivery, however this outlet is different.
They are usually late in service even they are a very few customers.
Moreover, they have less no of options of eatables including snacks and beverages. Sometimes their machines do not work and customers have to wait to make payment.",1
Super friendly place! Yvette was our CSR today and she was very friendly and helpful.  Really clean too  which is surprising because it's been raining for hours.  Great location too!,1
So fun! The playground is HUGE! There also an arcade and shopping inside. My kids thought the elevator was neat to ride in a Mc,1
Good food. Good service.,1
I love this McDonald's.  It's across from Hilton Orlando.  They got good deals for breakfast and during the day.  The quality is amazing.... Way beyond what I expected.  The McCafe drinks were so good...not water down like those in NYC.  I am giving this place 5 stars if you want cheap meals that fill you up!!!,1
"Best Mcdonalds in FL, yet. Quick story, I came to order a quick meal because I missed a bus. Almost fell out and no one engaged me about it. Understandable. So I ordered a meal as well because it was well maintained inside-out. Looking for a good restaurant?! This location knows hospitality. Lol",1
"It's McDonald's, doesn't matter the city the food is all the same. 2 double cheeseburgers and a fry. Perfect lunch on the go.",1
"The McDonald experience is that you can find the same on every single establishment but what really makes a difference and makes you come back is the way the employees treat the customers, on this specific McDonals the manager (Timothy) makes such a good j",1
I loved your pepperoni pizza and California suhshi. Highly recommend this clinic.,1
We went for breakfast before going to Aquatica. The service was fast and good. Everyone was nice and helpful and our food came out fast and hot. Everything you want when you come here!,1
They still serve pizza and pasta at this location. Plus a huge arcade with a prize counter to redeem tickets is upstairs.,1
"Very nice customer service! Helping, and making my family feel welcomed! Maria was the best help!",1
I don't like self order machines,1
"Fantastic staff, manager and food. Far beyond any other Maccas I've been to",1
Went to this McDonald at 130 am,1
"Long lines here since it's in a tourist area, but the service was friendly and the food was hot. Just be prepared to wait in line for a while.",1
"The best McDonald's I've ever been to, hands down. My kids could play in the play area for hours. The made to order omelette, served to me at my table on a China plate, was delicious. The staff are overly gracious and professional. If you have been to Orlando and not stopped here you are missing out!",1
It was a little pricey. Just like eating in a real restaurant. $50 for a family of 4. But I'm sure it cheaper if you get normal meau things. We got noodles and pizza. It was plenty of food for the price.,1
"The single NICEST McDonald's I've ever been to!!  And that includes the location on the Disney property complex.  2 floors, massive play area for kids, full arcade, elevator, and the bring the food to you.  Glad to see the owners transform this place.  Well done!!",1
"Never ever had service like this in a maccies! Don't know if it was had a convention on next door, but was outstanding!",1
Probably the nicest McDonald's I've been too. Staff was super nice and really trying their best to make happy customer's and smiles. We even got to try free blueberry pies! (The pies were AWESOME!!),1
"So I never thought I would be reviewing a McDonald's,  because well its McDonalds.  However, I was in town for a conference and grabbed a quick lunch in between sessions.  The food was typical McDs, but every staff member was just so friendly and helpful.  Granted I dont eat at inside McDs often, but I have never been so delighted and cared for ar one.  Greeted as I walked in, ordered from kiosks, food delivered to me, staff member checked on how my food was and wished well by members as I left.  McDs needs to bottle up the service from this location and send to all.  Cheers.",1
"Clean, roomy and just a wonderful eatery!

The food was good and the staff was great. I usually dont eat at McDonalds due to the ones around my house being rather run down looking and dirty.

This was a pleasant surprise.",1
"Nice staff, quick service",1
"New kiosk-based ordering can be a little daunting at first.  But, it does seem to speed things up.  The food is what you've come to expect from McDonald's.  It didn't disappoint.",1
Good food,1
Late last minute 12am food run....McDonald's is pretty much the way to go lol.,1
"Best Mcdonalds I've ever been too. Way better then the ones in Alabama. They use a machine for ordering,  making customizing your burger easy. Pretty neat, pretty neat. If you like Mcdonald's you'll like this place.",1
Clean Restaurant and friendly staff. You can tell they are working hard to make sure your orders is perfect. Thx.,1
Had to order on the tablet screen. Then I was told to take a number to my table and it would be brought out. They never brought it out and I had to go ask for it at the counter 10 minutes later.,1
"They are the first McDonald's to get an order right the first time and not make you park. Food was hot and fresh! Cudos to this McDonald's! Anytime I visit, I'll be sure to go to this one.",1
Biggest McDonald in America with an extended menu arcade and play area ! It is a Must go! .. just not now lol play area is currently closed due to COVID and arcade area needs a little tlc (a little wipe down on dust,1
Great place to go grab a meal!,1
They got it right! I order double quarter pounder all the time no cheese no bun everywhere I go . I never get that. It's always a debacle. This McDonald's got me! Thanks guys! Nice Manager too!,1
Sweet tea is amazing!!,1
Crowded... long waiting list...,1
the food was good but the pineapple smoothie did not taste like pineapple smoothie.  taste like ice only.,1
Great place to eat anytime. Affordable good quality. Couteous and fast service always. I really like the self service order,1
"Everyone knows what to eat at Mc Donald's. The location is clean, fast service.",1
Great place for kids and it has pizza...,1
"Very good we had icecreem, it was good sitting area .",1
Clean place. They have cool machines so you can order yourself but I couldn't figure out how to use it which was surprising to me. It was faster to order at the counter with a cashier.,1
Food was oh so fresh I don't even eat mc Donald's,1
"Went in for breakfast on a Monday morning. Went inside, pretty empty. No line for drive thru. It's one of the new touch-screen style McDonald's, service was fast and easy.",1
Service is not good. They don't pay attention to orders. Give you wrong food. They need to slow it down a bit. It says fast food but give us the right food plz,1
The new and improved McDonald's catty corner the S Concourse of the convention center,1
You got to love the people who work at the McDonald's across from the convention center those people can get slammed at times and unbelievable Manner and they still handle their composure thank you for all your hard work,1
It's a fairly new McDonalds. I like the comfortable padded chairs for the 2 person tables if you eat in. Of course all the great hot food and serve yourself & free refills of drink. A great choice for a quick lunch!,1
Found it unwelcoming that food has to be paid at kiosk and no option for human interaction.,1
Busy but orders are right. Needs someone on the floor constantly to clean dining area customers are slobs here leaving trash everywhere. Tourist clean your shuff this is someone elses home!,1
Great overall but carefull with togo orders,1
"Clean, convenient, and efficient - only issue is that the member of staff that served me was very grumpy and really not very friendly at all. It was as if she was in a foul mood!",1
"Clean, modern and efficient service. Right next door to the hotel we stayed in so great for breakfast. One of the less touristy ones on I Drive and imo one of the best.",1
Same food but really good service!,1
This McDonalds is newly renovated with self ordering kiosk. This McDonalds also brings to food to you table for all dining guest thats someting you normally dont see at anyother McDonalds.  The only issue was seating the new furniture at this restaurant is not kid friendly the table is way shorter than other Mcdonalds my daughter was spilling food all over the floor.,1
They always seem pleasant.  When I use the drive up window they are really fast waiting on us.,1
Love the electronic ordering and the table service. It's nice to see that McDonald's is moving in that direction. I had a much better experience because of these amenities.,1
"Great food, very clean, received food quickly, staff was friendly to me. I saw staff engaged with customers and diligently cleaning their location.",1
"It's McDonalds. The food is consistent McDonalds, ordering is through the sel-serve kiosks or drive-through.",1
"It took more than 30 minutes to get the food, they had 3 girls at front including the manager. The manager was working so hard and even with angry customer she had a smile on her face. If I were her I couldn't do the job. I think they need more people like her.",1
I love the cashier and the people working there there was this guy named Jose which helped me in the register and also threw my food away so I barely needed to do work and it was a great experience for my family next time we visit Orlando I will visit come again,1
"Confusing drive-thru lanes, but quick and friendly service despite long line wrapping the building and accurate orders.",1
Good food,1
This is a very nice McDonald's. It was clean and staff was very polite and helpful. They bring the order to your table if you are dining in.,1
Actually the Pilot gas station was built on this property as a addon. Just stopped here as a pit stop on the megabus to Atl Marta Center *Peachtree where they dropped us off at.,1
Clean restaurant and quick service,1
"Clean. Up to date technology, where shoppers can order from monitor. Associates were friendly and helpful. Good stop between meetings.",1
"I guess this has an extra added experience of a play area and and arcade to boost. But Micky Ds is always somewhere you know you can go anywhere in the world and find something you like, this one was slightly different as you could get pasta and pizza and all day breakfast option",1
Food is consistent with McDonalds.  New electronic order and table service and overeager employee makes it feel like they are owned by Chik-filet.  I like the old style service with counter ordering and FAST order filling.,1
Fast and friendly,1
Great store!,1
This a fantastic  McDonalds. I get coffee here several times a day. ALWAYS friendly.,1

Best McDonald's I've ever been too. Customize your favorite meals. Fresh delicious food and friendly staff who check in with your dinning experience. Much recommended to McDonald's lovers,1

Helpful staff and tasty food. Top McDonald's.,1
"Since this place has been remodeled, it looks fabulous, andI love the food. My favorite is the McDonald's Mc series. They are truly orginial foods. Sometimes you may get a person who is rude and messes up your order, but that rarely happens",1
"New Cashier kid was pretty lost and messed up our order completely, But the manager on duty was awesome and handled everything to make it right.",1
"I went to McDonald's and the service was friendly and brisk. We got our food and were amazed that after all these years, the food is still awful and our bag was missing a sandwich. The missing sandwich was the highlight of our meal",1
"Well organized, I came at a busy time on Saturday morning used, the ordering kiosk with a coupon to go, and left in 10 minutes.",1
This McDonald's is supposed to be the biggest in the world 2 floors with indoor climbing frame and games room the place itself is very spacious clean and tidy fast service friendly staff also provides a good selection of pasta salads and fruit for those non meat eaters,1

"I had a nearly $50 order with tons of customizations. They got it 100% right which is rare for a mcds.

Food was great and the family didn't throw
a fit because their food was incorrect. 占쏙",1
It was good for being buzzy employees actually brought your order to your table when it was ready it was really packed but well managed,1
"For fast food taste,  it's the same as every mcdonalds. But this location uses newer tech that allows you to put your order in with out talking to a person.",1
Love it very quick service very help people,1
Regular McDonald's but the point that you ban get pizza an pasta made it a bit more interesting,1
Largest Mcdonalds i have ever been in. I did not like the fact it was all automated,1
"Great, crew was funny and food was perfect. They never let me down and I'll continue coming here for this crew is amazing",1
"Everything  was cooked perfectly,  and the Service was very good!
We enjoyed our breakfast ",1
"Im pretty sure that this is still the largest McDonald's in the world. Three stories and a menu that rivals many other restaurants. Large selection of desrts and other foods as well. Its more like a "" theme"" restaurant. Pizza and pasta plus so much more with a McDonald's theme and of course the normal Mickey D's menu is included.",1
Very clean MacDonalds. Great grew. However MacDonalds needs to make french fries like they use to. They've lost their loving feeling on quality.,1
The food is good just like you expect from a Mcdonalds staff was nice and delivery was fast,1
"Fast ,fresh, great service...",1
New order and pay yourself stations and table top delivery services have snazzed up this Mickey Ds!,1
Bad customer service and nasty attitude got my order wrong and didnt want to gove my money back and cheated me out of my money,1
Not bad at all just crowded,1
This was the Orlando location by Aquatica.  Much better than NY locations in my opinion. Everything was fresh. Employees were super nice.,1
"It's McD's! I always stop in the drive thru for either of my favorites a quarter pounder meal, bisque egg and sausage meal or a mocha cappuccino! They're usually always busy, but fast.",1
"Best mcdonalds ive been to in a long time. Fast service, the good ketchup (some mcdonalds have that gross watery ketchup), and even BBQ sauce at the drink bar. Clean and polite staff. Im loving it! :)",1
One of the best interiors I found for any branch. Didn't actually try the service but would expect the same.,1
They seem to make an extra effort to get my order correct every time. Great location!,1
The food is great and they have excellent service for a cheap price.I personally think that their french fries and burgers taste better than Outbacks and its even cheaper than Outback.,1
I liked all the smiles welcoming me. But I was in rush and had to watch the slow motion speed of service.,1
Very busy place  big place the place was clean 10 plus,1
Very clean and friendly service..especially the cashier Patricia,1
It was a great McDonalds. We used it as a meeting spot before. We used it to change clothes after the storm. It was just a great place to meet eat and greet.,1
"Very modern place, super fast service via the electronic kiosks with little fuss but the place was quiet so might be more chaotic during busy times as there are only a couple of kiosks to order food from",1

"They screwed up my order, but fixed it quick. Very friendly service. Self order machines.",1
The whopper is great there,1
"Hey, it's a McDonald's, whattaya expect? Has digital ordering kiosks - that actually work - so there is that. In a neighborhood full of tourist traps, some reliability is a plus.",1
"Stylish and clean McD with a great service. Order at counter, self service or app get it delivered to your table / car. I am loving it ;-)",1
I had the salad there and it was quite nice. The place was clean and the service was quite fast despite being full.,1

The young woman who seemed to work the register window always brightens my morning,1
Typical McDonald's ask for no pickles on the burgers and guess what we found dean pickles almost threw away but was too hungry and too far to comeback,1

Betty was fantastic!!! (Other staff were fab too) Choose this McDonald's over biggest Maccies every time,1

Really enjoyed my breakfast  this morning ! Hot and fresh!! Not a long line at all. They were getting the orders in and out! I really appreciated the young lady at the counter. She made me a,1
"Since it re-opened, I go for breakfast about once a week. Literally have never had a better hashbrown at any McDonald's anywhere in the country -- its so perfectly crispy every time. My order has always been correct. The staff is super friendly and the wait is never long.",1
"Very, very, very slow service, shame on this store it took 12 minutes to cook a quarter pounder when on the paper only takes about 4 minutes if you use the press 2 1/2 minutes . I worked in Boulder city Nevada as an assistant Mgr. And we had 2 minutes to get one order out and 1 minute special orders so I don't get it, but... On the other hand visit there if you are not in a hurry otherwise don't even try it, because Fast Food Restaurant IS NOT!",1
We had a small birthday party for my 4 year old at the play place and they were more than accomadating. The area was clean and a worker came and helped us clean up after the fact without prompting. Super nice of them!,1
Loved this place...kids area was great....it was nice and cold inside...great after a hot day at the zoo...and food was ready fast even with our big order,1
The food would have been great if the tables weren't so nasty,1
Hey yo got that buy one get one for a buck. My 10 piece nuggets almost gone Bru.  Taking this Big Mac for a buck home Bru hahahahaha Psi-chopathicpeppamintpimpin,1
Fantastic theme which is inspired by Dallas zoo and compliments the same .  Spacious and also have a great kids play area.  Crew are good .must visit when visiting the near by zoo .  Kids will love it . A refreshing unique look than other mc Donald,1
I think I've always loved McDonald's and I really like what they have with the vanilla milkshake and I get to Becky McDonald's and sometimes in order of tater tots real good place real good food,1
"The man that takes the order is great, he been there for 10-12 years! He's great!",1
"I went inside with my kids and being that it's next to the zoo, the inside decor is made to look like we're at the zoo. My kids loved sitting at the table while we waited for our food.  The employees were friendly and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time. The restrooms were clean as well.  I recommend it. 占쏙",1
"I only buy 3 things from the menu...sausage muffin bundle and a sweet tea half sweet/half unsweetened.
They consistently make the best tea out of the 3-4 McDonald I frequent.",1
Its McDonalds... The place is remodelled. Gone are the Zoo themed life-sized animal replicas on thee inside. 占쏙,1
"It's a McDonald's with a Zoo twist. If you are reading this review, you likely already know how the food tastes and what is on the menu. The key difference here is the great animal decorations on the outside. More importantly though is how efficient this location is. Every time I've been through I've seen a drive through 10 cars deep and watched them churn through everyone's orders in a matter of minutes. If only every drive through was this efficient.",1
I am changing my review from 1 star to 5 stars after my recent two visits (Mar. 2023). This McDonald's has gone through a major overhaul. Newly remodeled inside and out including employees.  Employees are very polite and welcoming even asked how my day was going and talked about the weather. ,1
McDonald,1
They had my food very fresh,1
"It's a macdonals.. so food is alright. It was clean and loved the jungle decor thats a nice touch. Only thing was the baby changing station the table opened outwards instead of longways like a regular one, and it was leaning toward. And with my 2o month old it was just a slide.",1
The young man wearing the black mask that said king on it taking orders today (12/5/21) during lunch was absolutely awesome !!  His Customer service was on point and he was extremely pleasant !  The food was correct all across the board and we couldnt have left any happier. He needs some sort of recognition for an awesome job well done ! He made the rest of the store look good today.,1
The Lady was a little rude over the speaker but face to face she was nice so I gave her a compliment regarding her hair.  But my order was right everything was not except the cinnamon roll that's why I only gave them 4 stars please warm up the cinnamon rolls,1
"The employees,& staff,were friendly, and polite.",1
"Order was correct, but drive thru took long",1
"I didn't eat here but stopped to use the restroom on the way to DFW.   It seemed clean overall.  I enjoyed the jungle theme.  It was inmersive,  right down to ""Lions"" and ""Lionesses"" on the bathroom doors!  Somewhat of a weird location just off the freeway exit, lots of construction in the area when we stopped by.",1
Was blown away fast and fresh food was little bummed they took animals out,1
Great people fast not mess up your order real pros to. The manager asked if my order was right! He's was great nice polite and friendly.,1
Food is always fresh and hot.,1
"The service was good. The young girl assisting me was polite.
Their playground is huge, and air conditioned. And its decorated nicely. We liked the tables with animals on them!!
My kids have been begging to come in here. They loved it.",1
Fast food drive through service was quick and courteous. Great! Dine-in was not available yet. I am looking forward to seeing the inside. Fun animal theme would be fun to enjoy with the kids after a day at the zoo.,1
They actually have a play area which most McDonald's don't anymore.  We also loved the animals inside and outside,1
"New staff provide a fresh experience. The food is always fresh and in it's proportioned correctness. A large french fry will have more fries than a medium size. Imagine that. "" I am loving it"".",1
The best looking McDonald's I have ever visited. Located near the zoo. Friendly staff and fast service.,1
"Was good service, would've been better if we wasn't walking around a homeless person passed out on the sidewalk was strange for sure",1
Friendly management and staff. Ready to make sure you are satisfied with your order.,1
Cute place to bring the kids. Never seen a McDonalds like this one,1
The employees were very friendly. Our order was correct. The food was hot and fresh. The tables were clean. My kids were happy.  Thanks for a great lunch!,1
Love the French fries. The coffee drinks are great! Excellent place for small children. They do have healthy good for the kiddos. Fun place to play. Many treasured memories with my little grandson. (He's 20 now!),1
My kids love going to this McDonald!!! It a zoo McDonald,1
Super friendly staff which is so different when it comes to Mc Donald staff. Every time I go there they seem so happy to be at work and serve. So refreshing. Plus the morning staff manager is so on point and the staff really reflect them well.,1
"It would be nice if the play place was open again but it's not so that was disappointing. It's clean, employees are nice, got my order right.",1
"I went there this afternoon with my almost 3 year old. The food was fast, made right the first time and was good. The staff was wonderful and the restaurant was clean and the animals were amazing. I could not compliment this place anymore. If we lived here we would go here a lot.",1
"Although they kept forgetting stuff,the ladies were nice and quick with our food. Super upbeat,love the environment!",1
Food was good and fresh,1
Had a great time the  family here .  Very friendly environment  and the food qas great,1
"I haven't been to McDonald's in years and I was surprised how good it was. I have the southwest salad and it was great. I don't know if I would go back for another few years, but I was pleasantly surprised. Also the staff here was super sweet with my little girl to ask to trade in her toy from her happy meal.",1
"Hot fresh fries and the frosty machine is up and working  after 9 pm? I know, it's unheard of right? Well I had a really great experience at this location. Staff was professional and pleasant and the food is yum!
Thank you everyone.",1
"This is an American classic serving up hot and fresh fast food favorites. I like this location because the people are always nice, and the service is always fast. This is really good if you have a short lunch break and need to make the most of your time.",1
"This was a good McD. They made a good product that wasn't smashed in a bag and thrown out the window. They actually salted the fries, that's a lost art anymore. And the girl at the window was sweet and full of smiles. Obviously a happy crew does better work.",1
I퐒e used the drive through only. Service is great. I love the outd,1
Very fast friendly service,1
I like coming to this location the morning team is always kind & friendly...the night team has more younger team members some of them have great customer service..but the only thing that stopped me from rating 5 stars the point system I've had trouble several times adding my code to gain point for my purchase ...and reached out to McDonald's customer service and was told someone would contact me but that hasn't happened ,1
"This is a wonderful wildlife themed location right next to the Dallas Zoo and perfect for bringing children for lunch before heading off to the zoo. The staff is always friendly here, the management is good and the restaurant is much cleaner and well run than most McDonald's in the area. Prices are typical of the food chain, service is fast and the food is usually above average for fast food. Can't go wrong here, especially with the kids. They will love it.",1
"Very nice fancy ""CLEAN"" restrooms, that's a plus! Very clean lobby area and nice play area for children, just no hooks on the restroom doors to hang our coat, jacket or purse. Overall it's a well managed McDonald's compared to others I seen. :) A-1 rating I also love the Dallas Zoo theme! It's a tourist attraction. Thank you McDonald's for your professionalism in management and customer service. (Please put restroom door hooks up for our coat, jacket, diaper bag and/or purse, thanks!)",1
"I rate this place five stars cuz these guys do deserve it, the food was hot fresh and exciting still to this day! And yes I knw we all ate pretty much everything @ McDonald's, but these guys put there love into cause still to this day, I want another one... And no one has made my hamburger like you guys, and I really appreciate that. Thank you McDonald's, I'll be back! And shout out to the manager who helped me and my family that day. Thank you!",1
"McDonald's is McDonald's. Consistent menu/ food quality. What sepates this location from other's is decor and friendly staff that do a great job with order taking, getting it out quickly and keeping area clean. Besides the large play structure this location is an extension of the zoo experience with  models of a giraffe nibbling leaves from a tree containing a huge snake, a  touchable cheetah statue and chatterbox chimp. Great place to go with kids.",1
Well its very clean with good food.i recomend the number 6 mcgriddle,1
Good food nice place,1
I'm guessing that this location is a training hub or something. It seems like it's always some kind of trouble when it comes to order food show code on app for food pay and go. Sheesh ,1
"Hey guys,  want a quick little pick me up for brunch? Order an apple pie , wait till you get home to heat it. Spread a little butter on it, pop it in microwave  for seconds . Top with  ice cream...don't for get coffee!...now that's a nice little something,  for a little bit of nothing...all at the Mac..",1
Passing through from a volleyball tournament.   Great tasting food with friendly service.  Had bagel nice and hot with fresh hashbrowns.  Definitely recommend if hungry and needing to feed a family fast on budget.,1
"Awesome, super nice staff!! We stopped by every Mc to get the BTS meal. Only this place has the special paper bag!! Even the BTS pic!!! Thank you so much.",1
I liked it cause its right by the zoo and my daughter loves to play but the staff there can be a bit abrasive after a zoo event like the Halloween trick or treat event they we understaffed and ran out of a flavor of soda and large drinks and I payed for a large but only got a medium they should have just made the fries large but the guy running the register seemed kinda new,1
"I love going to this McDonalds by the Dallas Zoo cause they have these animals that make noise and look like a jungle in there. Today we were there around 7pm and the cashier and the manager were so nice to us and they even talked to my kids and made sure that we got everything we asked for. The only thing I didn't like was that for the happy meals for my kids they got the same toy and it was a girl toy, I have a girl and a boy so my son got a girl toy. I know why McDonald's do this but it's not the employees fault.",1
A couple years ago at 5 am I went here pregnant and got an egg mcmuffin when i got home to eat it and go to bed it was dripping with grease. Today i ordered a 20piece chicken nuggets and 3 large fries they were all served fresh and i only waited a few minutes.,1
"Stopped in late around 1am but received good service, area  around drive thru was clean despite age of building and outdated signage for the play place but received order and the team member even placed an extra sauce I requested at the window in a separate bag instead of trying to shove 5 in my hand like most do.",1
"Neatest McDonald's I've ever been to (except maybe one in Roswell, NM), the jungle zoo theme is awesome. Food was good, service was great. Even gave us a free drink, very kind.",1
"I buy my drinks there. The Management staff there does not have a problem giving me honey with my coffee. The Managers and their staff are always asking their patrons is everything ok and will address small problems with a smile , even the homeless. Not like the rude manager that I have reported twice on (Robert B Cullom 75215 in South dallas) and I never heared anything back from McDonald about that !!!! As she stated they are only going to redirect you back to me . Since I haven't heard anything back Im going on Social Media about that manager in the South Dallas McDonald's",1
If you like a lively staff who can make you smile and have a good laugh this is the McDonald for you.  They were very pleasant and funny.,1
Fancy Mcdonalds.  Zoo theme nice.  Everybody friendly. Had a hard working young man named Nathan.  He was doing everything. Working hard.  All over the restaurant.  Just wanted to let him know somebody noticed.,1
Busy place but the people who served us were friendly and polite. More expensive than other McDonald's I visit. I am guessing this is because it is near the Dallas Zoo.,1
Very unique McDonald's. They have all sorts of animal statues around that make random noises while you eat. The play place is unique and the outside of the place has so many cool photo opportunities. The food is typical McDonald's.,1
The tiger  was out and ,1
"Very nice place, it is decorated as Zoo kind of theme inside, Kids love to dine-in",1
"It's the perfect place to finish a long day at the Dallas Zoo. This animal themed McDonald's has a very large play ground area and plenty of tables and seats to watch the kids while they play. The food and service was adequate although the bathroom could have been a a little cleaner. All in all, it's different enough and the kids liked it enough that we will likely come back after our next visit to the Dallas Zoo.",1
Great food great staff....I stop there several times each week for breakfast and the food always arrives fast/ fresh/delicious and the staff always remembers me. Highly Highly Recommend this location!,1
My 3yo granddaughter loved this place. The play land is well designed with plenty of room for active exercise and the larger than life zoo animal motif delighted her.,1
Wonderful place especially for kids... The staff is friendly and helpful. The food is always fresh and the location is clean. Wonderful to eat inside especially after a visit at the zoo...,1
No matter how many cars are in line they get you through pretty fast. when I got to the window I wanted to get an extra order of fries and they told me they couldn't sell them to me.,1
"I only eat breakfast here now, but when I get my hot caramel, its a hit or miss. Sometimes its perfect, days taste like dirty water but they will correct it.",1
Even though my receipt was two days ago they still have me what I was missing out of my order instead of declining,1
"McDonalds is great! It is a sure thing. You know you what to expect. Today I was surprised! A new burger caught my eye. It is a Spain inspired burger. I was hesitant about buy in it. This was new and well it could be great or ruin my lunch BUT I took a chance aaand!!! Oh my goodness!!! It was sooooooooo yummy! I mean it was so yummy that I hardly touched my delicious fries! Well, my normal favorite is the quarter pounder with cheese .... today it was that Spain inspired burger. I guess it was the cheese or the sauce(normally I don't like sauces on my burger) but I don't know if it was the combination of bacon, the different cheeses or what, but it was soooo good. Yum I will have to come back to this McDonalds. I don't think they sell this burger in just any McDonalds, I think it has to be in one of the safari themed ones. Anyway it was really good! It made my day! I was happy the rest of my meetings and sessions. Normally it would be boring but hey my tummy was cheerful and so was I.",1
I frequently visit this McDonald's and I'm never disappointed which I know isn't saying alot but these days normal as advertised service is a hard to come by thing.,1
I had to get out of the rain and service was really quick.,1
Had great service last night fast and friendly with fresh food,1
The ice cream is the best. But the Hamburgs are to small and the frys the make are the best as long as there Hot,1
They are really good people that work at this McDonald's they go out of their way to help. The place is very clean and we'll run,1
The people work there very friendly. Simply i love it,1
They still remodeling. But good food,1
Everything was good during oiut visit.   The staff was friendly and the service was prompt.    The food was hot and fresh.  This is where we go after our visits to the Dallas Zoo!,1
Fries were hot and fresh not soggy at all. Actually had to wait a few moments before inhaling them as to not incinerate my tongue and mouth,1
Excellent customer service and well prepared food.  Drive-thru staff were professional and friendly. I even had eye contact and a smile!  This is how it's done!,1
Pretty awesome and reasonably priced  too really like the any size drink for a dollar.Reminded me a lot like (Chi) town' own very well liked & famous for the best hamburger by far south side White Castles hamburgers,1
Clean fast accurate and most importantly friendly. I take a few extra minutes to go out of my way to eat at this location.,1
"gregory is amazing & this place has good
service ! got my order in less than 3 minutes",1
I received my order as ordered,1
Apart from restroom being to cold on a cold day the place looks nice. Awesome animal displays.,1
"order was wrong, but staff made it right and free burgers and fries",1
Son loved his happy meal this is the zoo McDonald's it is great it has fake animals and animal pictures everywhere,1
Best McDonald's in Dallas! Great way to continue the zoo fun after walking around the Dallas Zoo all day. Kids always have a blast in the clean play area.,1
Their customer service was better then most McDonald's here in the dallas area. Very clean and the floor plans is like the zoo alot of animals trees .... Loved it,1
They were remodeling it and only the drive through was open. Line went fast and food was nice and hot.,1
Food was hot! Still got homeless people begging for money not for food. And why are not the staff wearing gloves handling the food back there.?,1
"Fast, fresh hot food, staff is friendly.",1
Would be slightly better if they paid more attention when you order. Still pretty ok if you like the sounds of the zoo to follow you to lunch.,1
There is a new zoo animal added to the front can you guess what it is....the service was gr8 and not a long wait!,1
Took a very long time to get our mobile order but our order was correct. Which was great.,1
Mgr used great CS skills after another customer recieved my order. She was awesome under pressure..,1
The service was outstanding and I enjoyed being there.,1
"All order was correct and made quickly. Ordered #4 chicken sandwich.   Fries were burned.

Staff friendly- busy stop.",1
The phone still taste good but the services gotten pretty slow I love all the inside playgrounds for the kids on these hot days,1
Always quick to get you served . One of my favorites.,1
A must be place after you visit the zoo. Have an ice cream and drink soda here with kids and enjoy the background animal sound and decorations.,1

"Clean, keep the entrance door windows clean, polite to the customers,  always have my UBER orders ready for customers.",1
"Very good, pretty punctual, there's some issue with the ordering, ordering screen, and the timing of all of that.",1
I haven't been a McDonald's fan in a while but every time I come here the food is perfect!,1
"I love this place..a great place to bring kids...n if u r in a hurry its the best place to stop,trust u wont be there long",1
Noise of animals is scary. There should be warnings.. aside from the cheetah print booth seat decal. Beware.,1

"Good place to eat at if you're on the go! I like the sausage & biscuit w/egg,and it's good.",1

McDonald's!,1
Excellent ,1
It was great!! I like that they haven't changed anything and it's jungle themed,1
"For the first time I see such a McDonald's, made either under Madagascar, or just like the Jungle. The lion growls, the elephant trumpets periodically, the boa constrictor hisses, the children like it. But there is no self-order screen. Civilization, apparently, has not yet reached this forest with animals.",1
It was prettier when I had the animals recently I went and the lady who was cleaning bothered me because she was complaining about her work with hints as if I had dirty everything and be careful I always pick up my garbage and my children's even when we arrived we cleaned the table where we did not sit because it was dirty and also when I was leaving in the bathroom I found her again and again with her hints what a pity with this lady,1
"It's so cool! Have animals inside like an anaconda, giraffe , monkeys  and the guys are so gently! You can take ur kids to eat, before going to the zoo!! I think it's cheaper than inside zoo! // It's grea",1
"Very good food, good prices, very clean, excellent zoo environment, and very comfortable and spacious and clean children's area, thanks ",1
"Excellent place, good attention and the playground is large and everything is alluding to the jungle because it is close to the zoo",1
Very clean everything Buy good only the staff seems annoying,1
Very good they remodeled it very well,1
"Quite a resort, I asked for Ketchup and they only gave me a bag for 5 hamburgers and 10 nuguets",1
"Good place to buy fast food to go.....
very kind",1
It was very good they served us quickly very efficient,1
Excellent service by drivetru Very Rapids attention and I also hope that they are very kind,1
Ideal to go with your children to enjoy good food and fun,1
"The place was very clean, nice and we got our food quick, but our order was not complete and the guy got upset and mad when we asked for the rest of our order.",1
This was a great experience this morning. I chose the lane that the screen went black. All of a sudden everything I knew I wanted I forgot seeing the black screen . The rep was great she helped jog my memory ,1
"Fast service Even tho lines be long at night service is quickly, I rarely heard them say they are out of any products like most do at night I have not yet tried an hot or cold coffee at night there, hopefully the machines still works since thru are on a very busy and tourist spot, very safe to go to at night.",1
Restaurant was clean. Ordering at a kiosk was pretty impersonal but the cashier was nice. I didn't like my breakfast choice - it looked like an english muffin with sausage. But the muffin was very soft and tasted like syrup. Yuck. My sweet tea was weak at best. However everyone else with me enjoyed their meal. Bathroom was clean too.,1
"truly one of the web services of all time. my favorite part was when they said ""it's Roblox.Amazon.Core'in time"" and Roblox.Amazon.Core'd all over the place!",1
Excellent customer service and my food was hot.,1
Great fresh food prep. One of the best McDonald's I've been to. Unruly school kids ruined the experience,1
Went thru drive thru and food was served fast and correct.,1
"That Donald's tho'...

The burger bun should be less white bread and saw dust  and more craggy , textured with a slight bite",1
Drive thru was quick and professional considering we had a order of 10 meals early in the morning,1
Fairly clean majority of the time. I guess that depends on who's working. But the customer service is pretty fair in all my experiences here. For a quick bite. I prefer this specific McDonald's. Food is always fresh. And I never have to ask for napkins.,1
It's a very nice renewed place. It's a shame that some homeless sleep inside the restaurant,1
Can get busy.  You can't miss it.  Parking is pretty tight but depending on the time of day you can find a spot. The staff have great customer service. The environment is clean.,1
Here you can order from a big touch screen and they bring the food to your table. It's also possible to order in advance through the app and they bring you order to your car.,1
"everybody screams on their own table. It's not employees fault,but environment terrible.",1
"No matter how healthy you normally eat, Mickey D's fries are perfect after a long fun night out! The drive through attendant yesterday (03/06/22) was pleasant and even gave me a water cup and mini kid size fries for my dog.",1
"I퐒e been here tons of times. I came twice this week, and had some of the best McDonald",1
"Excellent food, great prices, superb value",1
Quick bite morning online orders usually M-F being on the run. I usually see Maria which works in the drive thru she the kindest most nicest person ever!!! Today I had a little hick up with my order and Paola took care of it right away which felt like a regular day as I come by the drive thru. Thank you Maria and Paola you guys rock!,1
"For a fast lunch on the go, try a ",1
Looks like they renovated since I last went - person taking order was pleasant despite heavy orders - bit of a wait in drive through because of number of cars,1
"Love frappes at this location. Sometimes there is not good service, I think is due to covid. We have to wait until the situation gets better with a full staff so I can give a more objective review.",1
Oh yes Love Mc Donald's sense little however I am Bother by The San Andreas Fault-line Going To Separate Not Enough Sewers To Drain The Ocean Water Of It Done might create a Domino AffectThe Great Wall of America The San Andreas Fault-line Emergency Plan SCUBA GEAR BEFORE THE SAM ANDREAS FAULT-LINE SEPARATE CASH APP GODHEADDIVA,1
"When your hungry,it's the place to go!",1
"Be sure to keep eye contact with who takes your order, otherwise with the slew of Uber eats orders coming in by the second, your order can easily become either relegated or dropped in priority. Craving ice cream? Ask them to make it last in your order, for if you're waiting, you might as well have ordered a milkshake being it will be pretty molten. Overall, the staff have changed for the better, and their service continues to get better and better.",1
Solid dive bar with good food. The chilli is excellent. I had a salad which was decent too. You can smoke inside which is a rarity these days. Nice staff who are attentive and friendly in doing so. It's in an odd location for sure.,1
Good staff and good service,1
Overall a decent McDonald's. Clean and fast.,1
Wonderful people here thank you.,1
"The service at this McDonald on NW 36th Street and 22 Avenue is amazing!

I came in before my shift at City of Miami Parking Enforcement Department and had my breakfast.

I had two delicious and hot burritos and a Diet coke. There coke system is second to none always on point. The staff is friendly and ready to help yo",1
"This is what I call one of those 50/50 places. the food quality is always good, it's the people inside, specifically sometimes you have homeless sitting at a table, or a very loud bunch of drunk adults ( kids I don't mind, that's what they are suppose to do). there is nothing they can do, but I still get my order and eat at my scooter outside. not fun but what can you do.",1
Very clean and friendly employees,1
This is a very friendly restaurant.  Even when they are busy they seem to find a way to smile. Some do need to check their attitude at the door but for the most part they are usually very accommodating and service is typically good.,1
"Night shift, Huge improvement since my last visit. Very organized and clean. Management controlling everything. It looks under new management. I like the new service of taking your food to your table.",1
"The fresh coffee is good! Only 99 cents, you can not beat that! A lot of freebies if you download the app! Paola,  the assistant manager,  is cute and friendly!",1
Long wait but after order it was fast.,1
Great service,1
"The food and service is great, the staff is well-trained and they never argue with the guess. They work out at an alarming fast pace. Good brand to work.",1
"Two drive thru lanes for faster ordering, plus open late. Great chocolate shakes! Thanks again! 12:29 am Saturday, May 12, 2018",1
"I enjoy eating here very much. It's probably my favorite McDonald's because of thier excellent customer service. The staff is efficient, the dinning area is clean, management has thier game face on, and the food is just right.",1
McDonald's is cool with me big breakfast is always really good McChicken sandwich and maybe a quarter pounder or two other than that yeah it's McDonald's,1
I ate he a r at least 5 times since I was in Miami and I never eat from this chain as I got older and more wiser.,1
McDonald's is McDonald's. This place is good for the Children & the young peoples not for a old guy like me. I just went there to buy a black coffee.,1
Well managed and the food is good. Take it from an ex McDonald's employee,1
"Always check your bag before leaving, moderate defect rate",1
I origin gave a bad review because they were a bit slow but I had to give them five stars for not allowing themselves to be punked by the Miami police officers who think there entitled to a police discount.  Ahahahahahah,1
"I'll spare the typical McDonald's speech about how it's bad for you blablabla . . . Since I moved to Edgewater, it's been the most reliable source for an ""actual"" late nite craving. Past midnight, it'll fulfill your sugary/salty cravings whatever the time is. Absolutely love it. 100% reliable.",1
Food was delicious....I always get the big mack and fries and ask for it to be HOT ,1
"Newly remodeled, so a beautiful building. Convenient ins and outs. They got my order right, no complaints. ",1
Really Good service. I ordered a breakfast burrito and Mocha Ice coffee,1
"Quick service inside. But drinks are behind the counter!!

PARKING NOTE: Make sure you park before you get to the drive thru, there is no way back in from that point on!!!!!",1
The staff is very friendly with me I've never had an issue with them very nice people working at McDonald's is very hard I am an employee at McDonald's too so I know,1
Good service. Hot food and friendly employees especially for the overnight at 3 in the morning. Thanks,1

Lovely staff. I have done 2 Customer Satisfaction Surveys. High grades.,1
"Nice staff, well organized in being professional and work in timely manner. Thank you",1
I enjoy coming to eat to this McDonalds. But the cashiers are very slow. And many of them have bad attitudes,1
Today was not a bad experience friendly fresh food fairly clean Lobby I actually enjoyed myself here at McDonald's this morning,1
No surprises for my $4 dinner a $2 bacon double cheeseburger a $1 McChicken and a $1 iced tea. The location isn't too bad for being downtown Miami,1
The best food ever. I been enjoying the hospitality of eating at McDonald's for years and always a pleasure going there for a quick meal.,1
Orders come correct and fresh Everytime never have a problem food also tasted great,1
Very clean store and they let you use the restroom. Somtimes you need to go.,1
Very helpful and patient cashier and supervisor. Walk-in was very quick. Drive-thru was quite slow however.,1

It's a McDonalds,1
Convenient,1
"If the app gives you the option to select a table, THEN THEY TAKE IT TO THE TABLE. They still get annoyed because they called me by the order number, when I was sitting at the other end and didn't even notice, until I complained to them 35 minutes later!!! Either they correct the app or better train the staff.",1
"I always return to this place because it is where they make the best ice coffee for me, some very friendly and polite shop assistants, thank you",1
Excellent we love McDonald's fast service,1
Rich fresh good price,1
The place is nice and it was clean. Mc Cafe very good,1
Good place very good attention,1
The employees lack customer service skills and are very slow preparing food. The self-service line was long and the attention inside was almost non-existent. The food was fine.,1
"I remember this place perfectly. With my brother we went on vacation to the USA a few years ago, when we arrived at the hotel they told us that we didn't have the reservation made... We got scared!!! So we crossed paths and went to wait at this Mc. They treated us very kindly the whole time we were there. Super loving 占쏙",1
"It is unpleasant that they are constantly towing cars in your parking lot and then the owners of the cars enter the premises claiming in an incorrect way, I understand that the parking lot is only yours for your clients like me but I think you should find another solution to this problem I think that behind all this there is a business with the grueros because I go to the place every day and on more than 10 occasions just someone parks their car and in a second the tow truck appears that they have hidden in the street behind the place, the service of the place is 5 stars I will continue visiting the place, perhaps they should make bigger signs in each parking lot that they should not leave the car in that place thanks for the opportunity of my comment because many times I have wanted to do it again thanks",1
"The coast is closer, so the MC is easily accessible! The shnake was delicious! The cheeseburger was also good!",1
"Excellent service, you can't eat there yet, but it's perfect to continue with a healthy distance. As long as this pandemic (Plague) is present",1
"~It seemed that the service was delayed despite the fact that there were not many people...otherwise, fine...clean and complying with health protocols....",1
"There is something from Mac Donald's where there is no refilling, they serve you 90% ice and 10% soda. When you tell them that it's impossible to pay to have flavored ice, they tell you that you should have asked for it without ice.... unusual...they even ask you how you want to breathe and it turns out that the customer is to blame for something they don't expect to be served.",1
"It's very good, during the day there are older Latina ladies who are very cool, but not at night and the place is not so nice.
I'm surprised that McDonald's promotions in the USA are so bad.",1
Excellent,1
Double Mac cheese burger extra bacon li y,1
The mace is good.,1
"Good location and easy parking.
Standard McDonald's service.
A few sporadic beggars, but nothing that bothers a Brazilian.",1
"They are very fast in the service and everything was very clean, the supervisor very attentive and respectful of their costs",1
"I had a good experience, the girl who helped me to make my order was very kind and when I got to the second window, very kind, they gave me everything I needed. It was midnight. I recommend it.... Excellent attention ",1
"Very good, although at this time there aren't many people who make shipping faster",1
"Quick or self-service attention according to preference, additionally some employees speak Spanish and English which makes the purchase process much easier",1
"They take forever to get your order out, whether it's in or at the drive-tru.",1
"The breakfast is the best but there are areas with a lot of tourism and only dark-skinned people, in any case, they are never cordial",1
"I received very good attention, the staff at that McDonald's on US 1 is very friendly",1
Always anywhere in the world my son will go,1
"I liked their breakfast, also their cheap prices, and their quick service.
It is a good place for breakfast. It will like you.",1
