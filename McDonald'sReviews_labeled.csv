It's McDonald's so I don't expect much if anything but the people running this one don't have a care in the world. Staff walking around in the back wearing scruffy old pyjamas looking street wear. (ie not the uniform and not even clean looking personal clothes) No hairnets. Kiosks not working. Slow service at the counter and long wait for food. Missing items. I could go on.,0
"Waited more than 20 mins, trying to make order but they just keep saying"" be right with you"" to finally tell me they dont have what i wanted.",0
"This Balboa McDonald is one of the worst in town. I don know why I keep going back. Well not anymore. Today mess up after a long slow line and being asked to pull up and wait, I got home and was missing 2 cheeseburgers . Clearly on my",0
"Probably the worst customer service of any McDonalds in the Metro Orlando area. Honestly, they should shut it down. Horribly slow and inefficient and they just don't care.",0
Terrible customer service. Ruby was one of the rudest people I,0
Terrible,0
Poor ,0
Very  dirty place !!! Manager is really really really Rude so will never go Again ,0
Just got back from extremely long drive through. Cold fries and dry old nuggets. Whataburger is around the corner.,0
"Lobby was closed with no sign or reason why, no curbside spots and super long drive thru wait. Attempts to call to see why lobby was closed but no one would answer the phone.",0
This location needs serious rehabbing. Only drive thru service. The line was wrapped around building and onto the street. My food was cold fries old n refried burned...smh... NEVA AGAIN,0
I was light headed. I figured let me stop at this McDonald's seeing that its on my way home and close by. I was surprised the shake machine was up and running. I ordered large fries and a Strawberry milkshake. I paid to much money for a little nit of food. My fries had way too much salt on them. Because they mixed fresh fries with fries that wrre sitting out basically old kinda stale. The milkshake had vanilla at the bottom with Strawberry on top. But that nits what kinda upset me it was the size of the shake. I was asked what size I wanted. Of course I was confused. I guess all McDonald's are not the same. I said small. But the cup I received was a cup size you order off the dollar menu. And I was charged like 5 bucks for it. Smh. Never again. I thought shake size was only small or large.  Not a baby cup size.,0
My cup was fingered by the cashier.   Two stars because he gave a new one when I asked.,0
"Never gave me the drinks I ordered. Gave me the wrong ones and never bothered to rectify my complaint. Very disorganized. The woman who I complained to was very bad mannered, didn't have good customer service skills.",0
"Very slow customer service, 2nd day in a row that they are out of orange juice. Not up to standards",0
Not as good as it used to be for sure,0
Kids love McDonald's but when people making drug deals in the parking lot there is an issue.,0
Waited 30 min in the drive through and did not even move. Rude cashier and no salt even on fries. Lol and they want to make $15 an hour! Comical,0
It was filthy,0
If the app says you can dine in there than you should be able to dine inside,0
"Usually I don't have time to eat at McDonalds. So I take food to-go. This is not the first time that I order something and I get something. These people always miss something from the order and since its to-go, I can't even go back and tell them. It happened like 5-6th so far. Very poor service from this McD.

Hopefully they read this and do something about it.",0
Typical,0
"Poor service, cold product nothing was good about my last visit",0
"Terrible experience. Came this morning at 4:28am, no egg whites, no scrambled eggs for big breakfast. Long story short.. waited almost 25 minutes to get the order. Unacceptable",0
"Average food, except they don't fill the fry containers all the way. The large is a medium at best. The bathrooms are horrible.  Someone had taken a dump in the corner and there it laid. Yuk.",0
Customer service badd the food is horrible,0
"Staff were swearing on the tills, wandering around in non uniform and using their phones. The girl on the till in the ferrari jumper was flat out ignoring me as I tried to order as she was busy sending Whatapps to friends and the few people who seem to actually care and work hard are stressed as they work with slackers.",0
Slow and food was cold,0
Food is poor...service is bad...long wait for food,0
The continents glide across the earth faster than the line moves here. Food was good at least,0
Didn't go here,0
Warning!! Use drive-thru ONLY! There is a Predatory Towing Company (ABC Towing)  that WILL boot your car! And force you to pay CASH ONLY to have the boot removed.,0
"Order was screwed up, and the hash browns in both combo meals were barely cooked to just above raw.
Amazing their staff could screw up two breakfast meals in the same order in an automated process. SAD.",0
"Absolutely TERRIBLE customer service is an understatement. The manager screams at everyone who is a customer. To me his young pond has no experience in customer service, I have never been to a place had experienced such a terribly trained and terribly managed location, this is very true. I have gone through drive threw and walked in. To see bad people working there, just do not care. I did send message to McDonald's Company, hopefully someone will see what",0
Poor ,0
The staff is unfriendly and very slow.,0
"Gave me the wrong drink, after 3 request",0
"Too many homeless people that kept walking in and out of this location, we couldn't eat comfortably because they smelled so bad as they passed by. I understand they can't help it due to their situation but if you have a hard time tolerating body odor of various homeless people walking back and forth in this McDonald's location then you should definitely avoid this location.",0
"This McDonald chicken sandwich tasted like they changed the cooking oil once a year nasty
Plus they always forget something by th",0
They closed the drive thru early and would not take my order made me sit in the line for 15 mins before speaking and telling me there closed at 1:55,0
This location fed me raw chicken. I ordered spaghetti with McCrispy and half way through the McCrispy it turns out raw.,0
Blonde Maddison lady had the meanest additude i asked for fresh fries and I got soggy old fries,0
Drive thru too slow,0
The biscuit was very bad,0
They had no remorse for people person like me and decentcy come with more smell with people like homelessness in mcds these days we needed help. Tamn I hated with all passion . I better off save my cash.shes,0
Ordered their signature Double BBQ Burger tonight at the drive thru... One patty wasn't even cooked.... The buns were burnt black instead of toasted. Fries came out cold. My wife ordered a #6 Chicken Nuggets with BBQ sauce.... Didn't get her sauce and nuggets were cold as well. HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!,0
Worst most disrespectful group on of individuals I have ever met in my entire adult life. This includes the manager who was working at 11:00am Sunday 4-15-22 who decided she couldn be bothered t,0
Not a nice experience at all . Kids were so excited about visiting this branch as its apparently been on You tube but omg Service is Very poor . Staff seem to have been given a sentence of working in here . The food quality is questionable as well . Would not recomend at all,0
"Since I work graveyards I unfortunately have to rely on McDonald's for food sometimes. I recently started trying to come here since the 7th east location is no  longer open 24 hours. Every time they've been closed for cleaning. If you're going to close update your hours so I don't waste my time driving all the way to you only to have to drive all the way to 2100 south.

Maybe you should stop paying starvation wages and you'd be able to hire an extra hand to help clean lol.",0
All of those workers got an attitude. They act like billionaires.,0
"*** Second Amendment Haters here***

If you value your freedom and right to protect yourself, so elsewhere.  They have sign posted restricting guns

Slow service too.",0
more than two hours waiting and I left without the order rude and drugged staff did not even know what they were doing,0
"if i could give it 0 stars i could, HORRIBLE SERVICE never give you what u paid for and when u ask for it they spit on your food.",0
Horrible they never get the orders correct and half the time the food is cold,0
"Bunch of non speaking English Indians running this joint. They can't understand my order, gave me the wrong food. Speak English  !!!!",0
Ordered through the mobile app and it didn't go through was told they couldn't receive online orders.  Should have something through the app to let people know if a location can receive mobile orders or not.,0
the staff is unbelievably rude and we had to wait 30 min for assistance #hurd,0
Bought a happy meal the other day and they decided for me that I didn w,0
Tried calling to find out what the Happy Meal toy is today for grandson. The phone has been busy for 45 minutes. Must be off the hook. Going elsewhere.,0
Terrible,0
They are very rude. I bought a hamburger with hair on it. A lot of teenagers with no educations. DRIVE THRU VERY VERY SLOW.  .,0
"Usually McDonald's allows you to pay w Credit card, grab your cup so you can satisfy your thrist if the staff is too busy.  This McDonald's I paid for a meal and went to grab my cup just I like I do 4 days a week and the staff woman yelled at me and accused me stealing despite the proof of payment  in hand... They were  Very ugly, mean and disrespectful.",0
Apparently when ordering counter pickup after 9 or 10 they don't allow you to and gotta go through drive-through,0
This place is the absolute pits. I have never experienced such poor management. The space can not hold the patrons. We were definitely at capacity and then some. They퐎e three floors and yet my dad and autistic daughter had to eat in the corner like slaves. You see my daughter is very routine so she is use to getting her happy meal and then sitting down to eat. At this location no one is,0
"Perhaps the most poorly run McDonald in Texas. Visited on the weekend,  so naturally busier, but the management, attitude of employees, and physical condition make this a location, in my opinion, the worst location we퐒e ever visited.
1. Trash everywhere, see pic for example. Trash on the floors, tables, parking lot.
2. Dirty tables. Obviously tables get dirty. So we asked if a team member could wipe down a table to remove ketchup and prior visitor",0
They are judgemental they think their better then other they do what the want if a could rate zero stars in wouls,0
Its mcdonalds....,0
Too much SALT on food,0
Everything is trash at the McDonald there ,0
Service was awful didn't understand my order,0
"Granted we at a busy time of the evening (SeaWorld was getting ready to close), but the lobby to thus McDonald's was locked even though all the signs clearly indicated they were supposed to be open for lobby hours. The drive-thru was open, but it was exceedingly slow. The service was poor, and the products we ordered were sub-par (even for McDonald's standards, which is saying something). We ended up just throwing some of it away. I typically do not leave negative reviews. I am hoping that they were just short-staffed the night we went.",0
"The attention was not good. Neither the cashier nor the one who gave me the happy meal were kind, I asked to change the toy because my son already had it and he responded in a bad way that there was no more.",0
Poor ,0
Service horrible,0
The queues are like for sausage in the spring in these McDonald's ... as if they give them out for free ... and the employees save ...,0
Really slow service,0
"The most incompetent staff and management I've ever experienced in a fast food restaurant. Items missing in my order even after I asked if it was placed in the bag, Rude staff, very unprofessional, laughing/ joking with other employees while on the headset taking my order. Business number that appears online is disconnected, so you can't reach any management. Not even thru the survey online you can get anyone from corporate. Definitely I rather microwave a dollar burrito than come back here.",0
"The drive through service is horrible. They gave me the wrong order and was told to wait. I waited  for over 5 minutes for them! The manager Maria Gutierrez (might have her last name wrong), FIRE HER!! After waiting for so long, I had to drive through again, only for her to lie and say she gave me my food. Very rude individual. Had lost all my appetite by the time I got the food!",0
They take a long time to give the food.,0
"""Ran out of straws""? Suspect",0
"Be careful, they will only let you buy large meals at night time. But serve medium, not many notice because they're drunk",0
One of the worst I've been to. pretty dirty,0
"This is the worst Macdonald you can imagine, the customer service deserves 0 stars and the employees don't care at all if your happy or not with the food you paid for. They will give you a nasty attitude for no reason when you ask for BBQ sauce they tell you they are out of BBQ and give you look like your asking for something they shouldn't have.",0
"Every time I come here, something is wrong with their payment system or one of their machines is broken",0
"Ordered a large iced coffee w/cream and sugar and an order of hot cakes.
Received a medium iced coffee with no sugar. And an old pancakes that are basically rubber. And to top it off no syrup, no butter, and a spoon to eat pancakes. Definitely wouldn recommend this location. It",0
Was not open for dining in on Friday at 11pm- even though it clear said open on the door and the line for the drive thru was ridiculous. Better McDonald n,0
"Warning avoid this location at all costs.Truly one of the worst McDonald's in the nation. There's always an issue in the drive-through there's always an issue when you go inside the store. The staff is not friendly not greeting when you walk in the door they have no idea what the 3' ruled is. Whoever their trainer is should be ashame when they have the McDonald's conference in Orlando Florida. If I could give them negative stars I would. When you go through the drive-through there is not a proper greeting. It as is if you are bothering the attendant taking your order. There is no quality service. It's all about quantity, instead of quality.",0
Fries were cold and seemed like they were dropped back in the grease after already being cooked so were the nuggets.,0
Rudest night crew I've ever experienced. The boy they have acting as a manager is horrible and very unprofessional. All they do is blast rap music and play with each other and be rude to the customers.,0
"I asked for my order to be prepared fresh & hot and it was the opposite the fries were hard and cold. McDonald's shouldn't serve fries unless there fresh & hot. Why do we have to request our food to be fresh, it should just be fresh off the press. These fast food places kills me and there getting worse.
Their customer service skills are poor, they have language barriers. I need to protest against these fast food joints.",0
Terrible,0
"I bought two meals from them for my friends, and they gave me bread and cheese in exchange for meat. Hahahaha, and the account came out with 30 dollars. Damn the mother of fraud",0
"Fast food is called such because you should get it fast, completely unacceptable to wait almost 30 minutes for BREAKFAST",0
Never get anyone order correct food cold and old,0
"Terrible services, long wait times.",0
"The staff was disorganized and confused,",0
My car was booted and i was forced to pay 200.00 to have the boot removed even though i had 2 receipts grom McDonald's,0
Worst service a cash only McDonald lmao (to be fair it 3am) anyway went through drive thru twice first in both lines and still didn,0
The man behind the counter is out if control. He says inappropriate things. He said something about peeing on himself and getting arrested where all the customers who were eating  could hear.,0
"Do NOT go to this McDonald's if you're in a hurry. We were just picking up a drink so it wasn't a problem but ordering was chaos and there was a guy beside us who had seriously been waiting 35 min for his chicken sandwich. He showed us the receipt showing when he ordered and was trying to ask the staff what was happening and they were quite rude and just said ""man you can see we busy"". Also note that this was the only McDonald's we encountered in Florida that doesn't offer $1 any size soft drinks.",0
This is the worst McDonald's I've ever been to. They made me show a receipt to just use their disgusting bathroom. They could at least clean it once a month. Also everyone was rude as could be. The customers are paying your bills. Don't go here.,0
"Stopped by on my way to work, all I could see was the floor full of trash, trash cans over their limits, and the employees worried about who took holidays off or clocked in late instead of getting their selfs to clean",0
"Just ordered 2 BigMacs, one with no lettuce.
Had NO sauce  the other had  a teaspoon worth on the edge of the burger.
Fries were meh.",0
"Worst. McDonald's. Ever. The management is bad (in the evening), they are slow as sloths, and orders are more often than not missing something or contain old food.",0
DO NOT GO HERE!  This was the most unprofessional treatment that we ever received by McDonald's. We felt like we couldn't even report it because we didn't have a name to call up the next day and speak to a manager he wouldn't even give us a name,0
No a serious place,0
Third time in a row to get the hamburger happy meal with just ketchup only to have cheese added each time.  My child will not eat it if cheese has touched it. They have new toys for the kids however we keep getting toys that are 6 months old. Not a good location for the lack of service and food.,0
Worst experience at a McDonald's restaurant. Dont waist your money at this location.  Recommend going somewhere else.,0
Went in late visiting from out of state thinking lobby was open since door was open and manager acted like we broke in and threatened to call cops if we didnt immedietly leave. Very rude,0
"Sold a ""McFlurry"" then delivered an un-blended pile of ice cream topped with crumbs.",0
"I ordered based on a picture of the sandwich and did not have lettuce, tomatoes etc.",0
"This location deserves a zero star rating. Please don't go here. Even if you're starving to death. I wanted 1 hour and 20 mins for 2 combos and 2 extra Sandwiches. Ironically, as much as the wait was bad, it was the attitude of some of the team members that made this experience extremely terrible. McDonald's corporate really needs to come here and train thestaff for hospitality. This location is a disgrace to what Donald's has boult over the years",0
To hell with this McDonald. They closed their lobby 10,0
"To many homeless and junkie hanging in there.....yuk
No place to sit

Terrible management",0
Terrible,0
"Stopped to grab some food and go to the restroom. RESTROOM WAS SO nasty ,with wet stuff all over the floor, no toilet paper and toilets were nasty.We walked out of the restroom, I told hubby no tissue paper .He said let's go this whole place is nasty. Trash can was overflowing around the floor ,all tables dirty and and no jungle sounds coming from the animals .. Disgusting.  THEY only had 2 families sitting in  the dinning room and 2 families in line ..",0
"Expect to wait 15-20 min for drive thru. Recieved our sweet teas at the window, and it had a bit of coffee taste. The person at the window sampled the tea and said it tastes like tea. NOT to us. Seemed very frustrated. She asked us what we would like. I told her Dr pepper, and before I could tell her the rest of the drink order, she rushes off and gets us 3 dr peppers. Then when we corrected her, she said we asjed for 3 dr peppers. This is my burger without onions and pickles. What you see on my fingers is grease from the burger. Good luck getting your food here.",0
Horrible costumer services!!! Waited in the drive thru more than 10 mins.,0
This is 3rd time I got this ,0
Every time I go through McDonald's my food is cold!,0

Insanely busy line around the building for the drive through out the door for walk in and order ridiculously busy customer service was friendly but order was wrong and took a long time to complete maybe they just need more employees on a Sunday morning my family is :-(,0
Torally F****d up and very horrible place. ordered something and got something else horrible. very bad service and the cleanliness is worst. The worst McDonalds I've visited till date.,0
They never have  Fresh food or my food is missing.,0

And the price higher and higher",0
They always mess up my order!,0

Terrible,0
"Got order wrong.  Grunt a ""here ya go"".",0
"I awoke one morning from a dream. Wiping the sweat from my brow, I tried to recall the details. ""Table service at MacDonald's"" I heard my self say aloud. I picked up my phone to find my dream a reality: MacDonald's had implemented technology allowing them to bring my order to me at the table. I could order on the kiosk, take a locator, and lo and behold, my order would appear before my very eyes. It was as if God himself had given me a glimpse of creation.

I sprung from my abode and ran on all fours to MacDonald's as quickly as possible, as if reality itself would evaporate before I got there. I arrived, breath short and mouth whet,   and began the final steps of my journey. My finger met the kiosk screen like lovers separated by the ocean reuniting.

I got my usual, a cheeseburger with no bun or patty, and sat patiently, gripping my locator  like the staff of Moses. The number seven sat abreast my locator -- the day God rested. ""I too would rest,"" I exclaimed aloud, ""when my journey meets it's end, as my food meets my table.""

But in the next instant, I was met with a fate worse than Gob's a thousand fold -- they called out my order from the counter and didn't bring it out to me.

My faith was shattered that day. Never again shall the thought of joy haunt my mind. Never again shall true happiness be known.",0
Still dont know how to skip on the pickles,0
"I love McDonald, so I going to eat my BigMac combo, very good! But the big problem is, very very dirt, dirty tables, dirt coming out of garbage cans, dirt on the ground!  I made a video and now I send it directly to McDonald Company!!! I talk with the manager!!",0
"Legit almost just got robbed here would not suggest going at night, even if your with the homies",0
To many junkies and drug dealers,0
Scarry ace to be too many homeless hanging outside didn't feel safe,0
Worse McDonald's ive  been too first they get my order wrong make me wait again and still give me the same wrong order,0
Poor ,0
"The people was nice, but they charged me $ 1.09 for a cup of ice on a 100 degree day",0
"Slow service and make sure they get your order right. Hint...Order from new kiosks. Buns outside asking for food, and if you dont help... they tend to get biligerant. Not cool, Mickey Ds. Manager knows, because I told them.",0
Food never fresh employee gets mad when you ask them to remake it overnight crew,0
I used to not have issues with the location I went to last night but in recent months they have been giving me the wrong order or not giving me my whole order amd when I went last night the night employees came off like they hated their job and didnt care about customers,0
Crazy congested with crazy people just setting on tables,0
Horrible...Bad customer service...Dirty store with the men's bathroom broken,0
Staff was rude,0
"I ordered a filet-o-fish, which I order everytime I get s meal at McDonalds. The fish was WAY over cooked and greasy. It didn't even look like a piece of fish! The fries were almost burned ....not at all like McDonalds normally cooks them. I told them I was not eating fish that looked like that...and to give me something else. They gave me a Quarter Pounder and new fries (which were still over cooked). The Quarter Pounder was the worst I've ever eaten...very greasy! I will never visit this location again!",0
"Really poor mcdonalds - service is fast, but they normally get the order wrong, and aren't as friendly as in new york restaurants.",0
"Massively understaffed. 25+ min wait for food. Also got the order wrong. Corporate needs to sack up and pay their people more because the world is on fire, inflation is rampant, and end times are near. Also every fat, miserable, Disney-going family you'd never want to run into frequents this place. Avoid at all costs",0
Employee at the first window was very helpful and he made sure my order was right however the girl at the second one ignored me and looked confused. The muffin sandwich bread was stale and very tough and the hash browns were cold and also tasted like they sat on a shelf for way too long. After 2 bites I threw it in the trash and purchased a sandwich from a near by gas station much better food). I'm from out of town and on my way to a meeting so returning wasn't an option.,0
I was waiting for my turn and the person who was the cashier serving a white person did not take care of me and he ignored me because I was Hispanic I felt discriminated against they are racist,0
Terrible,0
"Spent over 20 minutes in line to be told that only serve breakfast at 2am, even though their menu said lunch also.  Then told they were out of almost everything.  Don't waste your time going here at night.  I've gone two separate times and had seriously awful experiences.  Don't go here, there's a Denny's near by, and several gas stations with better service and better food.",0
it's not 24 hours. they work when they want,0
The employees were very rude and very unpleasant. Need better people skills. And better staff,0
Terrible,0
So disappointed... I entered this restaurant only to be confronted with a computer taking my order..  which was Not working!! No one noticed we were having difficulty.  So frustrating. Wont come here again for a long time!,0
"Good luck being served if you have questions about allergies. We asked one of the employees to check the ingredients of the chicken nuggets to make sure there were no dairy allergens. He asked his manager to check. She straight out refused. We couldn't even complete one of our orders.

30 minutes after placing our other order, we received fries so cold, when I went up to the front to get fresh ones, I didn't even have to say anything. One of the employees brought me new ones automatically after the manager ignored my presence.

The bathrooms were nasty, the tables were dirty, every trash can was over flowing, and the whole lobby smelled like rotten fish. This is easily the worst McDonalds in Orlando.",0
Poor ,0

7. It's really dirty

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME COMING HERE!",0
Horrible customer service. They treat Uber/Doordash like they are less than. Really bad. If McDs gonna take these delivery orders they should hire enough people to have them ready not leave a crowd of guys waiting for their deliveries. Unacceptable!,0
Terrible,0

Too slow...need to be more welcoming and get orders right !,0
"Very poor service! While on a long road trip we stopped in to get gas and coffee. Upon entering the McDonald's the floors were extremely dirty, but we came after lunch so maybe they had a busy lunch rush. Then when I stepped up to the counter to order, the menu screens were stuck on frozen 2 advertisements. Then I order 2 Caramel Mocha  Coffees. After about 3min of waiting the kid behind the counter tells me the machine broke he needs to get the manager. Come to find out the machine is on auto-clean and it will be 18min before our coffee is ready. Not wanting to wait around they tell me they can give me two regular coffees. When I tell them that regular coffee is 1$ a cup and I was charged 7.58$ for two specialty coffees they offer to make up the difference in food. That's nice and all, but we did not want nor need any food. I ask for just a refund at that point. Mind you this whole ordeal takes almost the 18min for the machine to finish cleaning but by now I just wanted to get out of there. The staff were all very young and seemed very poorly trained. While they were nice and tried to make it right, I think better training of the employees at this location is necessary. While waiting for my refund I watched multiple other customers receive the wrong order or had issues with their food. I dont often go to McDonald's but continued visits with poor service has definitely left a bad impression!",0
They have the worst service. I went there yesterday and i ordered a sausage McGriddle add cheese and bacon. They gave me a biscuit and i told them the correct order. They told me to park and we waited about 10 min and they gave us the sandwhich but it was a bacon and egg McGriddle . I told them the order again. I waited another 10 minutes and like 3 people came out and asking what my order was and the manager said oh an egg McGriddle like no...where did i say anything about eggs in my sandwhich and that took more time. It took 4 people to get the order right. Not to mention the wait. And on other days i come here the drive thru wait time is 20 min to 1hr. I used to work there and it is literally the worst location and it,0
Will never eat there,0

"Tried to order something at the drive thru around 11pm and was given zero response during the 20 minutes that I waited. According to what it says online, the place was suppose to be open til 12am and yet I couldn't get a order in around 11pm. I sometimes wonder if the owner knows that they been closing up earlier than usual.",0
Worst employees ever! Had to wait for 20 min and they pretend like didn even know that they have my ,0

Workers were not friendly. They picked and chose who to serve. Some were told that the lobby was closed and some were served.,0
"I only drink the coffee. Have you seen ""Super Size Me"" FML",0
Terrible,0
Not big the food,0
It's a McDonald's that food is the same as every other McDonald's is decent didn't like the place because it was too crowded too messy and took forever just to get a soda or no people were nice workers were nice,0
"Food is yucky, greasy, fake, but  if you get the fries w/o salt, you have a  winner",0
Location filled with guards. The staff takes purposefully long. I hope they're not stealing (mcdonalds).,0
"I waited in the drive thru line for half an hour, ordered my food, and not until I got to the window did they tell me they were taking cash only, at 11pm on a saturday? And when I asked to talk to the manager on duty they were no where to be found, mever returning to this location and would urge anyone thinking of it to stear clear from this horrible McDonalds",0
"I asked for 5 sausage McGriddles, #6 and some other items. I got 6 sausage and biscuits oh and my 4 hashbrowns was soaked is grease. 2nd time within weeks, there will not be a 3rd.",0
"The worst Macdonald's that I have never been befor, dirty, crowded of homeless people and unfriendly staff .",0
Rude employees,0
"Waited in line for 30+ mins to get to order and they said that everything was broken and were taking cash only. Nice. I wasn't even mad, just disappointed.",0
"this cashier treats us very badly, nasty attitude he should not work here,",0
Slowest service. Ever.,0
"The locations looks great and has 8 of machines that allow you to order and pay, but the service was horrible. I ordered a sundae for my mom and after 10 minutes of waiting, I saw one employee feel a tear in her pants below her butt and then she went and fixed herself a sundae and left. At this same moment another came up and asked about the sundaes for his family that he ordered 20 minutes prior. I was given a refund without fuss before leaving. The bad part to all of this was there were about 12 people working at the location during my visit which was more than enough to prepare and delivery the food quickly.",0
Spent over 30 minutes waiting in line at the drive thru at around 9 pm. Finally placed my order of 2 egg mcmuffins. Recieved 2 egg mcmuffins that must of been sitting since the morning hours from breakfast. The white portion of the egg was almost black. They are supposed to make them fresh after breakfast hours not serve on from 12 hours prior.,0
"The milkshake was melted and watered down, and the staff seemed annoyed when I asked for a refund.",0
Food is too salty.,0
Worst experience at this store the employee are sleeping instead serving up will never eat at this place .,0
"Raw meat! Dont go here, second time happened to me",0
"If you are looking for something to eat on the way out of town, avoid this McDonalds like the plague. Diet Coke had no carbonation, and the food tasted absolutely vile. Tasted nothing like McDonalds is supposed to taste like. Maybe try the McDonalds in Primm instead.",0
Drive thru is pretty slow.,0
Worst food ever. The hamburgers taste like a paper.,0
Horrible! Gave my whole family food poisoning!!!,0
I ordered a caramel machiatto and it tasted really spoiled. Last time I will be visiting here.,0
"Worst driver though order experience, they give the order to someone else, when you ask where is your order then they take you recipe. No one cook your order until you ask them again.",0
They are fast but they almost always screw up your order!,0
Just left McDonald after a wait of 20 minutes and left with nothing. We made order milk shake and icecream and when we reached the window. She said the machine is down and I forgot to tel you because I was busy.,0
This place is horrible! I walk in to get an order and they keep walking back and forth in front of me without asking me if I needed help. I ask someone if they could take my order and she ask the other cashier to take my order the other cashier totally ignored me. If they don want to take care of walk in customer then they should close the lobby I had to walk aw,0
"WISH I CAN RATE THIS 0. I JUST PAID $40 ON UBER EATS WITH ONE REQUEST TO MAKE IT ONLY KETCHUP BC IM HIGHLY ALLERGIC TO MUSTARD, AND EVERYTHING I ORDERED HAD MUSTARD. ITS 2:30 AM AND NOW I CANNOT EAT BECAUSE THEY FAILED TO SIMPLY FOLLOW ONNNEEEE  FREAKIN DIRECTION.",0
They have new self serve order kiosks but they are very difficult to navigate. They are not very intuitive at all. My order took three times as long to be brought out. Good idea on the kiosks but very poor execution. While I was waiting on my order they had to come and tell two different people that they were out of what they ordered (fish sandwich and something else). Store was newly renovated inside and out and looked very nice but I will not be back.,0
The automated machine didn't print us a receipt so I told one of the employees who was nice enough to look up the number.  The problem was I had no reference to chek the order.  I spent almost 50 dollars for 3 kids and 2 adults.  I walked 5 blocks to get that food bbn order and when I got back to our job I discovered we were missing chicken nuggets and all the dipping sauces.  I ordered 6 sauces and we got none.  It really pisses me off because they always leave stuff out when we order large orders.  It's like they can only handle it if u have a simple meal.  It's so frustrating and plus it's like throwing 10.oo out the window..  you really need to be better about training your workers.,0
Poor ,0
"Too crowded, slow service",0
"You wouldn't expect it but it's not as good as it is in europe, not to mention if you'll go there really hungry by the time they'll serve you you'll starve.",0
"I Had A Bad Experience Today, My Family Food Was Late For Around 2 Hours. From 8.20 pm to 10.00. (04/28/22) Maybe Wasn't My Lucky Day. I love This Place, I've been there before and I spent a Nice Time, I don't Know What Happened. Costumer Service Tried To Solve  the Situation But They couldn't, all Costumers Were Angry.. At the end I Had to carry up  my order (incomplete) home....",0
Rolling eyes and aggressive teenagers at the drive thru when I visited at 8:15pm on 10/25,0
Long wait,0
"Worst experience. Drive thru line was longggg. I left the line and came back again at 12.15am, by then it was closed. 24 hours???",0
Never get my order correct always something missing !!!!!,0
half of the stuff on the menu was unavailable & the upstairs was closed.. granted i did visit around 11/12pm. the janitor was moping the same spot for 15 minutes. and my burger patty was hard and a little burnt . I would come back though cause it,0
Dining room is supposed to be open until midnight.  I showed up at 10:55  and the doors were locked. The employees just ignored us,0
"I took my children and their friends here for a treat after shopping. We used ordering kiosk..food was promptly given to us. When we found seating ,it was right next to the McDonald's security. Security cursed up a storm around my children with great vulgarity.",0
Trash,0
Bad service,0
disapointed ,0
"Saw the manager come out the back picking his nose, straight up digging for gold in that thing, then start serving people with no gloves #CmonSon",0
DON폯 order through uber eats they forget to give you the sauces,0
Ordered quarter pounder on 2 different nights and both times burger was still raw in the middle. Totally unacceptable for place that sells food. Stay away unless you want E. Coli poisoning.,0
Comfortable and children's play area. The service is very slow.,0
Bad,0
Maccas is what it is,0
It's McDonald's so I don't expect much if anything but the people running this one don't have a care in the world. Staff walking around in the back wearing scruffy old pyjamas looking street wear. (ie not the uniform and not even clean looking personal clothes) No hairnets. Kiosks not working. Slow service at the counter and long wait for food. Missing items. I could go on.,0
Bad service,0
"We were not impressed with this location. They locked the doors at lunch and only ran the drive-through. We made it inside, but that wasn't much better. The workers were not friendly and I had to order at a kiosk.",0
Poor ,0
Worst McDonald's I have ever been to. Staff was rude and disinterested and playing around with each other and getting drinks and walking around outside while customers waited forever for food. All booths were dirty and the chicken nuggets were exceptionally inedible. Almost like they were dropped in oil twice to be reheated. I had to give a star to write a review otherwise they would've gotten a zero.,0
Let me put it this way... GETTO. Most of the employees are on the phone and acting like they are at the park. Need to be more Profesional and get this place more clean. Frys taste like old oil. Macdonald fix this place please! The place is nice just need to work on your employees.,0
The food is horrible.,0
I ordered hot chocolate and they gave me hot milk.... I also order an ice coffee which was also completely milk. they weren,0
"Why do I feel sick Everytime I eat this ""food""? Why do I keep doing it to myself? FML lol",0
"Horrible service. Ridiculous wait time. Waited such a long time for an ice cream cone. They have over 10 people working and yet they're slow. They have someone who prepares all drinks but by the time you get your food, the ice in your drink has melted since it has become warmed",0
"As has been for the last year slow, slow service. Went inside this time, no better.",0
Very very slow in the mornings and employees are not too friendly,0
"Waited 30 minutes for my breakfast order. I wish I could give them 'zero"" stars. Owner needs to hire more employees.",0
The service is always bad the employees are rude everything is always broke,0
"This McDonald's is really going downhill, service is slow, biscuits overcooked and crunchy, bacon burned and the place is a mess. Couldn't find a clean table.",0
"I previously had great service with the last McDonald leadership team.  They were prompt and efficient.  This current team lacks the standards of the previous one.  Car lines were backup and missing items ordered in the bag, over 20 minutes for a hot apple pie, unacceptable. I thoug",0
They need to improve on their listening skills!!!,0
"Worst McDonald's ever. Unfriendly staff, they don't pay attention to what they're doing. Place isn't clean. They're rude to homeless people.",0
"I used to pick up food from this place 3-4 times per week. Why did I stop? The staff behavior, insanely rude.",0
This food will kill you,0
Cant even order inside. 2 thumbs down..,0
This location takes cash only. No cards accepted.,0
Typical,0
Im lactose intolerant and  i asked for 2 sausage burritos with no cheese and they gave me one without cheese and other one with cheese. This is no fun.,0
Came with my friends they were all over the place we were mid order and they left us to go talk another worker had to help us and she was not very nice,0
"1- customer service is bad
2- except to wait 5 minutes to get the food
3- the fries and the food are nasty they dont taste good
4- from my experiences and whenever i go , i never heard as much biping machines as i heard in this place

This is the worst macdonald i have been at

Overall, would prefer to go to the other place near by ( arya kabab ) instead of coming back to this place",0
Slow drive up window,0
The wait is long and the people are very angry,0
The lady at the drive-thru window was so rude and angry (for no reason) that I cancelled my order and drove away. The lady would only answer with one word answers and was not even polite. Drove to BurgerKing across the street where I was treated nicely and my order was completed with no problems or childish employees.,0
What kind of McDonald's only open till 7:00 p.m. for dining room,0
"a bad service, only cash, at 4:30 am they only receive Cash, BAD SERVICE",0
How does google say your open 24hrs but when I drive there it,0
"Could barely get through the line to park, spaces are way to small, and waited 22 minutes to get two coffee's!",0
Very slow service,0
"I'm from a foreign place and I just happened to stop in this McDonalds for a quick bite. These are the things I noticed. #1. Active on site security inside the establishment. I felt like I was being scrutinized. I assume shady things go on here. #2. I found out this McDonalds is located in an area called skid row. #3. The price of the food here is above the average price of the rest of the united states of america. #4. There isn't really a lot of friendly interaction between the clerk and the guest as well. For the most part this is what I gathered from this place. Taking into account that it was the first and only time I've been there. Not a good representation for Los Angeles for it being so close to the Greyhound bus station portal. If its any consolation , I received my food hot and it was good.",0
"Service was good, but to many druggies hanging out",0
its fast food but slow you now,0
Did the mobile order thing I asked for extra onions and got none at all that's how difficult it is for these people to understand English and even said it on the receipt extra onions,0
Junkfood,0
Rude women that work there,0
"Place was not noticeable based on the Google maps direction, I ended up looking for a while for it because it is missing the iconic double arches people know. I was looking within the mall area because of the map description, and wished I was across the street as it would have been easier to see. When I entered to place an order, one of the cashier's had an upset look or scowling face towards most customers, and unfriendly look. I didn't like her look so I stepped to the next cashier and I ordered it was fast, I ordered a Happy Meal and was asked if this is for a boy or girl (assuming a toy choice here). I get the order, no toy! And asked all they said was ""no toy, sorry"". I left, I'm not surprised by the lower than usual reviews here. Also when eating my food I ordered triple cheese burger but got doubles instead, at least I was charged for double only.",0
"What do you think my hamburger went against the receipt of the order, what do you think?",0
My order is always wrong. I was making my order in the drive through she ask me what I wanted to drink when I answer she we have no soda.smh,0
They never have fruit punch for kids and i can never get a carmel frappe im just going to start going to another one im disappointed everytime i come here,0
"Twice I ordered the quarter pounder deluxe meal and when I get back to work to eat, no lettuce and tomatoes.  Come on!!",0
"Long wait in line, fries that were nearly room temperature, and 4 chicken tenders of which 3 were so tough they were like rubber bands. And the diet coke was found (after we drove out) to be cherry coke. One combo meal for a ridiculous $8+. This is one McDonalds we will avoid in the future. And maybe McDonald's chicken tenders at ANY location.",0
The filth of the bathrooms is impressive. It is not possible to think that an internationally renowned chain maintains the bathrooms in that state.,0
Awful,0
Poor ,0
No ice cream machines again. Always broken and right next to many hot theme parks where people want ice cream with lunch.,0
Bunch of zombies working here. The lady at the drive thru window is sitting down while there's a line that doesn't move. Absolutely no urgency.,0
Poor ,0
This McDonalds forces customers to use the new machines. I couldn't order a large orange juice on my breakfast meal so I asked an employee for help. She didn't know how to order that from the machine either. She told me just order the small and that she would get me a large. While I'm waiting for my order another employee (I think it was the manager) told me I owed 50 cents for the large orange juice. She seemed annoyed with me and maybe the young girl too because we didn't know how to order the large OJ  I paid the 50 cents but was unhappy with how unfriendly and the whole experience was. I won't be back to this particular McDonalds.,0
I was waiting more than 10 minutes for a small frappe. They only put a little bit of caramel. It wasn no M. Bad service in this mackdona,0
Great place to go and have you're entire order screwed up. Then have them tell you there's no milkshakes after you pay for one meanwhile they give the lady beside you one,0
Place says it's open till 4am but it not,0
I didn't like my visit there my french  were col,0
Franchise owners need to hire more staff to keep up with demand,0
"When ordering food the employees conveniently forgot to turn off their microphones and were talking mess about all the food we had ordered, this is very unprofessional and honestly uncalled for.

Gave me wrong food,0
"CLOSED. UPDATE YOUR HOURS. GAS PRICES ARE WAY TOO HIGH FOR CUSTOMERS TO UBER TO YOU, THINKING ITS OPEN. RIDICULOUS.",0
"For a prime, busy, tourist filled location, the processes and procedures at this McDonalds are absolutely terrible.  Many of the self-ordering machines do not work, when you use a normal line with a cashier, it's like the employees have never even been to a McDonald's before as they don't even know the menu items (I ordered traditional chicken nuggets meal, so it wasn't pasta, or some sandwich that only special locations have).  When you order at a kiosk, you can order things they do not have such as a waffle cone ice cream.  Then you wait 15+ minutes to find out they don't have waffle cones and wait for an employee to make a fresh one, which she doesn't know how to do so you end up paying $4+ for a cup of ice cream.  I did get my money back for the ice cream because I couldn't believe it took that long.  Don't bother going here; it's not worth it, unless you want to feel like you're waiting at Disney at a subpar place.",0
Too many homeless outside and inside the restaurant,0
Its a McDonald's. Its gross. Smells like pee.,0
Waited almost 20 minutes for an order. There were only 5 cars in drive thru and about 7 people inside.  Finally I canceled and went to a sit down restaurant where I got served within 10 minutes.,0
Pep,0
Dirty bad customer service,0
How can they have about 20 employees behind the counter and run into stock issues. Everything is sold out. Poor management I say.,0
"Service is horrible , not enough staff , wait is long , didn get our order right afte",0
Incorrect delivery no tarter sauce on fillet o fish,0
Sat in the drive thru for about 15 to 20 min because they were very busy and still got very cold food. Took the fries back. Very disappointed.,0
"Poor attention from the team, casher and manager, discrimination against homeless person that wanted to buy food. Not a recommended place to visit.",0
"If I could give this place a 0 star rating, I would. I work late and sometimes don feel like cooking when I get home, so I stop at this McDonald occasionally. But, 99% of the time they only take CASH! Which I퐒e never heard of in my entire life. Tonight at 12:25 am on 05/27 I was getting off of work, hungry. So, stopped at this awful place.

"Terrible service,we have to go back 3  times since they forgot my big mac   , bbq's
Sauce  sweet sour souce  ,and my large order  fries with only half full.  The last thing is herzelnut iced coffee  with none flavor that I have to dumped away after first dip.  The most important thing is The only one staff seems so mad at work. When she doing the fries,one empty fries bag dropped on the floor,she got so pissed  threw a whole bunch fries bag on the floor.  She seems the manager, no other staff dared to point this out. They all just keep silent and clean the mess. If you are not in the mood ,go home plz. When comes to customer service, be nice then . That is the priority of your duty and responsibility.",0
For a very busy area the Mcdonalds here is very outdated and in need of serious renovation the lights outside dont work and inside seems very retro,0
"It looks clean, food is like any other McDonald's.  Disappointed the playhouse is not there anymore. That really made this place worth going to. Gave the community ties to this particular mc Donald's. I'll be going to the one thats closer to my house from now on. R.I.P. RONALD MC DONALDS PLAY HOUSE.   SINCE I COULD REMEMBER - 2020.",0
Waited 20 minutes for a mobile order that they have to serve to our table. Finally I went to the counter and asked about my order. They rudely said they don do table s,0
They get my order wrong every single time. It's kind of amazing actually.,0
"Poor customer service and  management. Our orders were incomplete, we asked staff to help us with the missing orders but it took 3 staff to confirm including the lady manager ( i think her name us caroline) before we get our orders completed.

"They could never get your order right, I had to go back there twice once, for a triple cheeseburger, they kept giving me a double cheeseburger.",0
I ordered an eminem mcflurry and so they charged me. After they charged me I waited 10 mins just so someone can come and tell me that they didnt have mcflurry. Like why tf would you charge me and make me wait?,0
Kept trying to give me the wrong items did not speak very good English. Food was hot though when finally got right stuff.,0

So slow for fast food. Half hour in the drive threw.,0
"Found the drive through staff to be rude on a regular basis over the course of several visits. If you can go a few miles down the road, the Sand Lake location on I-drive is much better.",0
Sketchy late at night. Cash only and no receipts.,0
I had a miserable experience with this drive thru. Waited 15mins to be told they don't have the McRib or ice cream available. The wait times are ridiculously long. Go anywhere else but this location.,0
Horrible service . Manager try to Force me to use a dirty computer to order my food .,0
One of the worst with service. I ordered a ice latte through the app for pickup. So I go inside I wait at pickup. Drink isnt ready and other people are waiting also. I mentioned to the solo employee I had a pickup order. She says ok then goes off to make other peoples meals. So I try to be patient stood there for like 20min and never received my drink. They never canceled my drink I left and was still charged for it. Also they never sent the 1 cashier who was struggling by herself no help.,0
They messed up the order after explaining a few times of what we wanted and had hair in both of my egg McMuffins,0
Very rude charging for sauce when you purchase nuggets really please check your receipt.  Manager  Francisco very unprofessional need some customers service training,0
McDonald's service and good taste are declining rapidly and they do not care. And they do not care. All they care about is collecting the cash.,0
"Rude staff asked the manager about the birthday grimace promotion and she said ""I don't know"" and walked away.",0
The bun of my Big Mac Us hard and dry,0
Take to long and they don't get your order right  employees to slow and on there phone joking and laughing,0
Half the kiosk machine's where down and crowd control was missing. Someone out front directing people and helping at the kiosks would have made a very different experience.,0
Not only was it packed and slow moving but our mobile app that said ready in 3-5 minutes actually tool close to 15 minutes. A BIG thing was having to pay to have a refill on your drink. That is ridiculous.,0
"Food it's okay, however the customer service is terrible. The few times I visited here the staff was rude, and unprofessional.",0
Somehow they forgot to give us our order...no big deal I needed the exercise and they did apologize,0
Terrible. Consistently understaffed. Just waited 45 minutes at drive thru. Food is disgusting,0
"The bacon cheese fries were cold and there was just a bit of cheese sauce on top leaving the bottom fries dry and hard. My daughter purchased a Dr. Pepper that taste like carbonated water with just a bit of aftertaste. We went through the drive-thru and it was very busy, so wet just ended up tossing most of it.",0
"I've eaten McDonald's EVERYDAY for lunch for over 2 years (I know it's unhealthy, but that's not what were here for) and due to my employment, I've eaten at many MANY McDonald's all over Austin and surrounding cities and this location has by far the worst staff of any McDonald's in the greater Austin area",0
"This place deserves no stars. My order, which was just a sandwich, was messed up three times and it still wasn't right. The staff was lazy and unhelpful. There was trash on the tables and filthy floors. Definitely no smiles served at this establishment!",0
My Grand Big Mac was dry and the meat was hard. I will not go there again,0
The McDonalds in Brodheadsville is one of the worst McDonalds I've ever experienced. Its sad our own hometown McDonalds is the way it is,0

The service is so decent and speedy.,0
"Do not eat here! People handling food are not wearing their masks properly which are meant to cover their nose, mouth and or both. Went the other day and two people handling food just had their masks hanging under their chin not covering nose or mouth. Disgusting. Air particles going right onto food. What a shame! Made a complaint online with McDonalds and they sent me an automated response not even address my complaint properly. DO NOT EAT HERE for your own safety",0
Typical McDonald's.,0
Very dirty and bad assistance,0
Inside closes EARLY!,0

"After decades of serving families, McDonald's is on their way out. I blame it on the district managers not doing their jobs. McDonald's needs individuals who can read, comprehend and speak English. Today I went there for lunch. I ordered #6 Filet-o-Fish sandwich meal. I ended up with 10 peice chicken nuggets. Hmmmm....I  guess the order taker did not know the menu item or understand when I said Filet-o-Fish sandwich. I quickly caught the error and told the cashier. She said, ""So you don't want it?"" Then, the manager came along to find out what the problem was. I  explained and received the sandwich. I left and when I  got home, I found out I  had a frosted breakfast pastry in a ,Filet-o-Fish box! Come on now McD's. May we get better service and expect a lot more from you? If not, please close your doors to save the public from the irritation.",0

We shouldn't  even be waiting for fast food more than 40 minutes . For order of chicken nuggets. Please . Also they wanted to give us watered down drinks . I mean i know fast food   isn't easy but damn 40 minutes really give me a break. Staff is extreamly slow. Won't  be back.,0

"Worst McDonald ever. The workers are really rude, don know how to work, take millions of year to prepare the food OR take your order and when you try to ask for basic things like drinks they treat you bad or ignore you.

"Very rude employee taking orders"" slammed the window in my face and left and  didn't charge me, also called the manager and the manager was worst than the employee, beware of this location this people are rude and very far from being polite- horrible experience, staffsocks.",0
Why did I ever think think that McDonald's had anything good for cheap. The best thing is their overpriced fries. The burger mouth feel was like tofu. I hope millennials kill ol' McDonald with their healthy spending habits.,0
"Same ol"" ready in 2 minutes food. Idk how they do it . But ramen needs to step up their game because it takes longer to cook noodles in the microwave . Great Job Mickey D's",0
"An abysmal excuse of a restaraunt, this location is a McDonalds only in name. With a wait time of 10-15 minutes at best for even the simplest order this location completely and utterly fails in its purpose as a fast food location. I strongly recommend any reader to take their time and money to ANY other location.",0
"The service was TOTALLY slow and it took the clerk about 5 minutes before they could even take an order.  I'm a local and I wouldn't ever go back to this location again. Seemed like a LOT of chaos happening when I looked in the kitchen area.  Also, clerks do NOT have a basic understanding of English. This is difficult if you're trying to ask anything of the clerk.  Would not recommend.",0
No open  on time 4am.  20 minutes late todas los dias.no good,0
"Horrible, slow, and unhelpful.",0
The late night service is terrible!!! Waited in line for an hour before I was able to place an order! Someone needs to fix this system or hire new staff.,0
"You enter the bathroom and there is no soap to wash, there is no paper to clean yourself. The hamburger is good but they deliver it to you with the black lettuce, which for me is rotten. The fries are potato fries ..... I returned them twice because they taste like oil from 7 days ago ... very low",0
Producing fatty and unhealthy food to the masses. McDonald's is a blight for any neighborhood and caters to providing saturated fatty foods.,0
No restroom bad service,0
Poor ,0
I only went cause my dad wanted to go. I don't favor fast food,0
"Absolute free for all inside. A automated factory that completely doesn work. People waiting over 45 min for their food, nearly every order was wrong, and staff just literally ignoring the countless customers complaining. The manager had no control over his staff who blatantly ignored him to the point he was telling customers their names to report. This place simply doesn work and is utter chaos. $40, almost an hour, and wrong food, with no one to care",0
Unfortunately it's not got any better. The first time visiting this trip and they got my order wrong.... I didnt have much faith to begin with to be honest. The attention to detail here is lacking. And $5 for a latte is unreal.... Tourist trap central. Cross the road to checkers and get good food at a low price,0
"Given too many chances. I've tried to be polite no matter how rude the staff. Tonight I gave 1 more chance. My order was taken down wrong so I confirmed at the second window before taking the food. The woman was very upset she had to remake it, made it clear with snatching and attitude told me to pull over and when i got my order it was wrong AGAIN. Also took items  and was charged for adding lettuce.",0
"Hi,

I have just purchased medium fries and large chocolate shake. I did not feel hygiene because they are cleaning their kitchen and they are serving at the same time with the same unclean hands without washing and without having gloves. Guys please maintain some hygiene levels while serving customers.占쏙",0
"Manager on duty was very rude.  My husband went today to pick up a missing item from order from the previous night that they forgot to give us.  Instead of going above and beyond to correct their mistake and guarantee excellent customer service, she proceed to interrogate my husband rudely.  In today's world where there are so many options to eat, you think that people would put their best foot forward to make sure their customers have a good experience. I WILL NEVER spend my hard earned money at that location EVER AGAIN",0
"The biggest waste of time and money. Way to packed. Unorganized. There was barely a line when we got to McDonald's yet we still waited over an hour for 2 bacon mcdoubles, a big Mac, a bacon chicken ranch (they forgot the bacon when it's literally IN THE TITLE) and 4 medium fries. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING was cold and disgusting. Spent way more money than it should have been. Will NOT be going back there. The kids didn't even want to play in the play area because they ended up getting hurt. Poorly set up and no security or anything. They were being pushed and shoved by other children and no one was doing anything about it.",0
"Bad service, cold food. I didn't get my complete order and had guide the staff multiple times to complete the order.",0
"Service was terrible I had to wait for ever to get my food, then when I finally did it was a security guard who gave it to me that was behind the counter for what ever reason he didn't have on gloves he put his dirty finger in my cup when he pulled it out the group of cups I won't be going back to this location the staff speaks spenglish I can barely understand what they trying to say I didn't get sauce for my biggest it's just terrible service on top of the 75 school kids in there standing around waiting for their orders",0
Very slow service especially at the drive thru,0
Lowest rating I could give.  How are you supposed to eat a sandwich that has mustard all iver the outside,0
"The food was not hot, plus staff  need to talk to customers  better .",0
They mess with your food here!!!,0
"To be honest I퐉 not a fans of fast food , I really eating when I퐉 running out of choice, but I really appreciated than in Mc Donald you have the opportunity to use the bathroom which is very convenient for people like me who spend a lot time on the road , I also believe when I go to a place I have to leave it better than I founded, with that been said I when to this location last night 04-04 -19 at 10:00 pm to use the bathroom , the bathroom is located in the second floor ,some part of the room ",0
Poor ,0
They was so unpleasant at pickup,0
Poor ,0
What is the point in having employees in a store if they don't help you? The employees talking to each other and when you want to place an order they tell you to place it on the machine. The store was empty! What are they there for if the machine is going to take your order? They are getting paid to chit chat? Bad customer service.,0
"We went to this mcdonalds to grab a quick bite, first of all the service was horrible, they do not know what they are doing. Second the food was cold. Third the place looks dirty, dirty tables and floors, a lot of people coming by the table asking for money. I will never go back to this mcdonalds",0
"The McDonald's buy the zoo... pictures say it all.   Food and drinks spilled all over the floor and tables, trash overflowing.  Don't even go in the bathrooms... yikes!!!!  There wasn't a clean table in the whole place!

Everyone was hiding in the back so nobody to take our order for almost 7 minutes.   Had I walked around and noticed the mess, we would have left.

As I'm writing this, I noticed there is a wrapper glued to my shoe.   The only nice person was the homeless lady sitting in the corner.

Don't eat here unless you want to get Ebola",0
"THE FOOD WAS OK
THE CUSTOMER SEVICE WAS EXTREMELY OFF POINT RUDE CASHIER N MANAGER",0
Terrible food and terrible service. While waiting at the window someone started yelling at the employee in which he stopped to yell back and call her a bit** and tell her that someone named bebe won't be in till 5. Highly inappropriate and I felt I should have drove off which would have been the better decision. No one should ever go here and they should rethink the staff,0
"The nuggets from this location were the WORST I've ever had! Unfortunately I didn't taste them until I'd gotten back to my room, otherwise I'd definitely have asked for my money back.",0
Food always cold and always mess up the order,0
"I rarely eat at mcdonalds but for convenience and the 40 min drive I had to take home I decided to give it a shot, it was 10:20 pm and went to the drive thru, the lady told me that ""they were not going to take orders until 11 p.m"" but it says 24 hrs isn't it? While I gave the round about I saw all the staff just sitting and chilling in the dining area... look I understand it's not the best job, but at least try... anyway do not try to go between 10-11 pm because you are not going to be attended",0
Super long lines,0
Horrible line and service!,0
I spent more time waiting for my food than what it took me to eat it. 28min,0
Not open 24/7,0
Too bad I only bought two coffees and it took me more than 19 minutes and they still moved me to the parking lot and then I had to return because they didn't take what I bought with them lousy service,0
"This place is a total wreck most of the time. This is an extremely busy location and I've been going here for years as a customer and also as a delivery driver and it's astonishing that pandemic or not, they still have the same issues. They are never prepared to maintain the volume of business. You often have to repeat yourself multiple times when communicating with the staff. If you go at night (particularly late-night) there's likely to be a long line in drive-thru or inside. They regularly claim their ""system is down"" and so are unable to accommodate you. It's completely upsurd. I don't understand how any establishment can think that this mode of operation is acceptable. Other than that, typical McDonald's.",0
"Seriously this is the absolute worst service I've ever had. The manager, is lazy and we sat in the drive thru for 15 damn minutes. We pulled up to the first window, and he opens the window and sits there talking and completely ignored us. Then we pay and pull up to the 2nd window and literally, 3 employees are sitting there talking. We're at 15 minutes and counting and still sitting at the 2nd window. All for 2 hash browns and a sandwhich.",0
The apple pies here were the worst. It was like biting into a regular apple. The only thing cooked was the outside. The inside was cold and the apples were hard. I went there 12/26/18 to get happy meals for my daughters and their fries were too hard to eat. I won't be going back there. I only went to reward the girls for cleaning their room and helping around the house for 2 weeks. (This was their choice of reward for good behavior),0
"We are staying at the hotel next door. My husband checks online to make sure the restaurant and dining room are open. They are. He walks over and the doors are locked. Walks back to the hotel, takes his car through the drive through, sits for 10 minutes and receives no service although there were employees in the restaurant. He sees other cars trying to receive service but they are all being ignored. He comes back to the hotel and calls again, at least 6 times, each time it says the number is disconnected even though he had already confirmed they were open through the same number earlier. Finally someone answers the call, he asks if they are open and they said no, he asked them why they answered the phone and were in the restaurant at 1am if it is closed, they said because their job is just to answer the phone. Its clear that the employees wanted to get paid for working all night without serving any customers. My husband used to work in fast food, and I wanted to believe that the stereotypes of McDonalds employees being terrible people and workers to not be true, but this location makes the company look bad. McDonald's should fire the franchise owner, or shut this location down, because they clearly dont know how to hire dependable employees.",0
I Placed my order on the app on 7/21/21 and paid for meal through the app when I got close to the restaurant I place my order after arriving 10 minutes later my order was still not ready I stood at the pick up counter and had to fine someone to help me which took another five minutesThere was absolutely no one at the counter to help,0
Too much waiting seems like the staffs don't know how a fast food restaurant suppose to be run. On top of the wait they forget items that you pay for so make sure to ask for a receipt if something not right with this McDonalds please report it call and complain.,0
The lobby guy is friendly but coughing by people who are eating. Staff were not friendly about no longer being able to take verbal orders and only using the kiosk.,0
Severely understaffed for such a busy location. I've seen McDonald's with more workers in locations in the middle of nowhere. Expect to wait at least an hour for food and make sure to check your order before leaving as I and at least half of the patrons I saw leaving came back missing something.,0
"What is it with McDonalds? I made an a order the cashier made a mistake told me to drive around again!

I spoke to the Manager he waived the fee on the mix up of menu then we sat outside 15 minutes in Las Vegas heat waiting for the food.

This place may be good for a walk in not drive through.

It a simple order how are is it to get it right.

2 stars due to waiv",0
They're supposed to serve breakfast until 11am but they stop WAY before that.  Not cool.,0
30 minutes in drive thru.... Ridiculous,0
"Everytime I go here they seem to have an issue with charging for ranch. Today a told them at the speaker box twice I wanted a total of 3 ranch. Which honestly, I could use five or six. When I got to the second window I only found one. It was a manger serving me. I explained to her that I asked for a total of 3 ranches. She hands me 1 and proceeds to tell me I was not charged for it. Annoyed I grab the change and explained to her I ask for extra everytime and it ends up like this. At this point the manager quickly grabbed 2 more and rushed me off. I understand I was not charge, I am willing to pay the extra dollar or 2 for extra. Please dont be rude to me cause I like enough sauce for my nuggets.",0
Service sucks and they take forever for preped food,0
"Was under staffed, long wait, order was gotten wrong",0
"If Mc D thinks Kiosk service is the future, I would SELL My Stock!
Probably the Worst Mc D experience I have Ever had...",0
I had a fly in my mc flurry...and i got yelled at about it ... im sorry.. last i checked the customer was right...,0
It's no longer a happy place it's terrible dark I'm never ever eating g there again it's like ordering your food in a jail disgusting you put up the computers and you fired everybody shame on you I will not patronize your establishment anymore,0
They no longer have chocolate dipped ice cream cones. What a shame,0
Ice cream machine is always down! It makes no sense it's Florida,0
"Bad service, bad management....",0
Slow but good,0
Told me to pull around and wait for order. They forgot about me! They weren't busy,0
"Delivery- complete joke! Don't bother taking the time to order sauces for your Nuggets! I ordered 20 spicy,  40 reg, picked out at least 9 different dipping sauces as ""required "" not to mention Desired by my kiddos!! We did NOT get ONE sauce or even a ketchup!!! Just to make sure they were consistant with disregard, they didn't even give us straws either to go with our $3 mango smoothies...2 of them! So, 60 Nuggets-NO sauces  AT ALL!  Not the first time they have done us wrong on the Nuggets so buyer should be cautious!",0
"They are always closed ...and no sweet tea after 10pm....and they always say due to maintenance issues....if your having problems just close up.
I won't be back.",0
"Understaffed!! I had to wait 20 minutes in the drive thru and another 25 parked in line just for a mcgriddle. Seriously?? Oh and ""jasmine' has a terrible attitude",0
Only gave me part of the food that I ordered them the manager gave me attitude they weren't remorseful for messing up my order at all,0
"Went today after the zoo, it was a very bad experience to say the least.
We were given over seasoned  fries, one straw for three drinks, and the drinks were all bad.
I thought how do you mess up a drink?
It is my belief that this was attributed to the mistake that was made with coffee order wanted moca frap was given hot coffee.
She took all drinks back and brought tray back with correction.
It tasted like instead of coffee mixture it was blended with old filtered out deposits, I mean really sour.
The manager however corrected the moca and recooked fries.
When we left a second time I tasted the unsweetened tea and Coke... It was horrible foul I thought omg I almost served this to my kids!!
Will not ever return.",0
Poor ,0
"It was bad enough when the dining room soda machine converted to the one nozzle machine, but they also did it to the drive thru. So now all their soda tastes nasty. I thought McDonald's was supposed to have great tasting sodas, not sodas that taste like suicides. Not to mention their staff can't figure out basic orders and there's a 90% chance your order is going to be wrong in some way. Added with the homless going up to every person, this spot used to be okay and nows it's more like the last resort.",0
"I don understand why all the time that I come to eat in here, is always a problem. All the employees doing nothing, the restaurante , is always slow at night, its empty and they take ho",0
"Waited for 30 mints after ordering, like a joke",0
Bathrooms are dirty and messy front lobby look good tables were wiped down and cleaned good hot piping food,0
"It takes forever to get breakfast here, every time inside and out",0
this mcdonald's is not open 24 hours despite all signage and hours posted. an employee rudely shooed me away when i showed up at 1:30 AM.,0

Slow service and bad food.,0
"So rude i asked a question i couldnt find the answer to online and the girl asked me if i knew what google was before hanging up on me. Kept hanging up on me and everytime i called back there was a new girl claiming to be the manager, and they are all disgustingly rude. Im actually shocked by how they treat other humans like this. I came in earlier at 8:30 and the guys working there were very nice, but calling at 11:30 pm i was not treated even decently by all the girls in there. The people here act like you퐒e killed there family members or something. Learn to act like a normal human being or go back to your moms basement and get out of customer service you disgusting humans. My cousin also left a ",0
Horrible costumer service the lady taking my order never even talked to me I even told her thank you after she had taken my order to be polite and she just turned around she filled the fries I didnt even care to complain but as u can tell from the picture I would have got more out of a small at most mcdonalds,0
Love the food but they take a bit too much in the drive thru,0
Very dirty and staff.is.not friendly at all. They act like they don't like their jobs,0
Very bad service! The person who served me was terrible! I do not recommend it!,0
Takes so fuxcking long to get Mt order ready like it's a just a ice cream tf,0
Don't ever go here after 2am. They always have system issues. So you'll need cash and park somewhere until they eventually get to your order.,0
"The day workers are very rude and disrespectful especially the girl who takes the order , I had the worst experience ever .",0
This McDonald's was the worst i haver ever been in.  ZERO STARS. Floor in entrance was flooded. Bathrooms disgusting. Soda bar dirty and filthy with no ice. Garbage cans over flowing. 12 to 15 people inside with one person working the register. This after sitting in drive through fir 5 to 8 minutes without moving.,0
HORRIBLE! It took 54 mins to get our food and then it was nasty. We watched the manager mix sweet and unsweet to fill a mans tea. Noone ever asked for our order so we pulled forward at the window. Will NEVER stop at this location on our way home from Seaworld. EVER!,0
Disgusting food!!!!! Cold!!!! Food!!!!!,0
"There women's restroom needed to be cleaned desperately, I had to report it to the manager",0
"Worst mc Donald's I was ever in employee constantly shouting out numbers to collect food, rude too, only mc Donald's I've been in where that is done",0
"Meh...just meh. Back in the day McDonalds was a treat you looked forward to, now the foods more expensive, the fries are never fresh, and the buns are usually stale. They've dropped the ball.",0
"Homeless people walking on  the restaurant, asking for money. Employees ignore it...",0
Typical long wait... Missing items... apathetic employees,0
"Our order was messed two days in a row when visiting this McD on vacation.

The first day they rang up our at the drive thru incorrectly AND didn even match the incorrectly charged order. Second day we ordered at the kiosk inside and they didn give us 2 of the items we ordered (an apple pie and hashbrown).

Not sure if there",0
"This is the worst establishment I've ever been in. Everyone is scrambling around like they are doing something yet nothing is getting done. Stood at the counter for about 8 minutes and no one took my order, or even acknowledged me for that matter..... HORRIBLE!!!!!",0
"The worst experience, seeing how the supervisor denied a homeless person some fries for 25 cents. I am outraged by the lack of sensitivity on the part of the staff and seeing how they laughed at the situation! . The poor man did not go to ask or steal, he wanted to be able to eat with what he had. Shame. I will not go back to that McDonald restaurant.",0
Was treated like a number only. Food was ok but not the best hard around the edges my food was kind of thrown at me not a good experience,0
"I GIVE IT 2 STARS because they were quick.But on the other hand,The fries were cold,and the burgers were drenched with ketchup. Told the gentleman to hold one moment and 5 seconds later a girl came on. Like give us a minute. I normally don't write a review and I hate to leave a bad one.But you would think because it's in front of oldtown it's hot and fresh. Just got out of the hospital wanted a warm meal.",0
Poor ,0
"Piss poor service. Didn't bring drinks over with our order. When we was asked for the cups, got nothing but a snotty nosed look and the server walked away and never returned.
Seemed to be the general attitude of all the staff involved including the senior on duty.",0
"Worst McDonald's I've ever been to. On Friday, February 17th, it was closed at 9:41pm. Wth? Really? Couldn't believe it. Staff that turned me away wasn't very polite either. What is this? Chucky cheese or something? Although I think even they stay open longer than that, Friday night c'mon. I hope someone from corporate will read this, might as well shut this dump down if you're gonna close around 9 on weekends",0
My food was fresh that why the 2 stars. But customer service goes a long way. And like an,0
"With a 6 year old we visit McDonald's every so often..this place was just awful.

Ordered 20 regular mcnuggets a large fries, couple drinks and a happy meal.

45 min wait - 17 spicy nuggets in the boxes, no sauces despite the machine asking what sauces we want. Drinks are just cups, despite the machine asking what we want - self service downstairs with no instructions on how to get the milkshake we ordered as only soda fountains at the stations etc

Nuggets were over cooked, Like properly crunchy/jerky texture

Fries were literally stone cold, not even warm

Our kid loved the play centre but this isn't worth paying twice the price of a regular McDonald's for just plain terrible food and no service at all",0
Waited in the drive through line for 40 minutes,0
"The chicken nuggets were overly greasy and seemed like they were reheated, and the staff lacked basic customer service skills.",0
Terrible service! My order was completely wrong but on my receipt it was right like how hard was to check the items your throwing together smh makes you upset,0
Worst one ever slow and rude,0
I park into the parking lot I see 2 vans full of homeless people's junk. I walked in the MacDonald's bathroom one of the stalls was full of poop. Later I got my food . Was in my car ready to leave then I smelled poop   on my hands. The entrance door had poop from the person's hand. But on the bright side they gave me an extra meal for free. But the cleaning service was not good.,0
Dirty.  Tight parking lot.  Too many homeless people.,0
"The waiting time was excessive, and when my food arrived, it was completely wrong.",0
"For the love of business, update your hours. This location has not been open 24 hours in two and a half years. It's super easy. Just call Google.",0
One snotty cashier..to the next .. they need to teach friendly customer service,0
"Customer service sucks! When I get to the 2nd window no talking they just hang my drink out the window and then shove my food out. I ordered a bacon quarter pounder plain and I get  a mc double with extra mac sauce! 2 times in a row my order was messed up, not returning.",0
"Very bad attention, not recommended at all!",0
"Visited  Sunday   17th  March 2019. Without any doubt  the worst McDonald's   I have ever visted. Yes it was busy but the staff dont respond. Stood around talking  whilst  massive queues of customers  built up. Absolutely  no interest  in customer service.

Food lukewarm so they obviously  not waiting for it to be cooked. No point sending it back to wait another 20 minutesNo one giving leadership. Ray Kroc will be turning in his grave. A disgrace if posssible 0 stars",0
"It's really bad, there's nothing",0
"if you're a tourist DON'T go to McDonald's especially this one, rude service, poor choice, worst fast food chain in US by far",0
Bad service. Very dirty. Bums are everywhere  begging for something. And did i mention very dirty? I'd go somewhere else next time.,0
Every time I come here my order is messed up. My food always cold. I order a mcflurry and its more ice cream than the topping. It sucks,0
Unprofessional customer service and Long waits,0
Bad,0
Horroble service ill never go back again,0
The worker ignored me and started helping another customer in the midst of explaining to me about the new iced turtle macchiato,0
"Incorrect orders most of the time, missing ingredients in the food or missing chicken nuggets. Poor quality of food.

I am not really a picky eater and don usually complain, but I gave this location a handful of chances?",0
Manager doesn't know how to put his name tag on right side up. How can he run a restaurant?,0
Horrible and very rude guard,0
Just left... asked to make sure to add flavor to my iced coffee cus last time they didnt.... well... I got plain iced coffee again!!!,0
I don expect much from a McDo Alf but this is a particular low. The 2nd floor close,0
This was by far one of the worst McDonald's I've ever been too. It was so loud and the tables were very dirty. The restrooms were very smelly and trashed.,0
My order is never correct.,0
Terrible,0
Bathrooms always dirty and my order ALWAYS wrong no matter what time of day.,0
Wish there was 0 stars because they would get it served me a raw double quarter pounder not pink raw  Too many dam young people with no manners working there  French fries always taste like chips I'll drive to rock and roll before I go here and I live in Oak Park,0
Orders are being handed out not in sequence the cashier was excellent but the assistant in the light blue shirt who did not have a name badge and wouldn't write down her name for me was not the nicest person for your establishment if it was up to me and I knew she was going to be there I would not show up to your establishment ther just letting you know but your cashier was very good in taking orders the handout you need a lot of help there thank you and have a blessed day,0
They must have been busy before we got there cause the store looked nasty,0
Not a good service nd i asked for ranch nd ketchup they didnt served me anything just becus they wanted to have a fast drive through,0
Came through drive thru at 11:30pm got no response.  Website and stickers on building stated that they were open 24 hours,0
Poor ,0
Serivce was horrible i walked in there asked for my drinks serveral times and the workers when lost and confused so i walked in a made my own ice tea then i appertantly caused a distrubance by doing that never going back here.,0
"Limiting 5 happy meals per customers. Ridiculous!!!!! I have 6 childrens. ""SMH"" UNBELIEVABLE!!!!",0
Probably the worst McDonald's I've ever been to! They forgot the mc flurry and were soo slow. Don't buy the quarter pounder!!!!!  :(,0
The food handlers were picking up the plastic bag of shack mix with gloves off of the FLOOR on then going back to food handling. You've got to be kidding me. What are you wearing gloves for?,0
"Looks like chicken nuggets bite piece served, change one is not complete cooked. I got terrible chicken nuggets never ever.
Atmosphere is bad needed more organized.",0
Terrible. Waited for 32 minutes and compared to others that was short. Food was cold and staff seemed nonchalant about everything.,0
"Hours are inaccurate, they close the dining room before 11:00, not midnight as is posted on their doors. The tea also has the distinct taste of coffee, which makes it taste like burnt tea....gross......",0

She walked away b4 i asked for condiments i had 3 deluxe b fast n she didn't gave me no syrup  she gave me 2 ketchups . Her service was poor. I honestly didnt trust my food but i had to eat it.",0

It's just convenient and cheap if you on the run,0
"The staff decided that there were no longer any mcflurries, after they prepared 2 sundaes and a milk shake . Suddenly the icecream machine was broken. A Spanish speaking customer after me was then able to order not only a milkshake but3 mcflurries. When I inquired about it I was told that it was now fixed although no one has gone near the machine during the time since I was denied IN ENGLISH. I then stepped outside to get my friends and tell them our food was ready, they took the tray and headed up while I put our other friend in an Uber. When I came back in security who had just been no more then 5 feet from me while I ordered, paid, and received my food, made someone come down to confirm that I was a paying customer. If only the counter staff was as particular as the security guard.
I won't be coming back here again, at least until my Spanish is better",0
No option for pickup no entering the dining room to order. Think about people who are pulling trailers. There is no way to eat here,0
"Over cooked chicken, over salted fries, wrong drinks.",0
mf wasted my time saying open 24/7 bt they are closed.,0
UNDER CONSTRUCTION,0
It's McDonald's for the love of God get the order right 1st of all 2nd of all put some napkins and utensils in the bag salt and pepper wouldn't kill you what apparently don't go to the drive-through because you orders not gonna get done right and egg mcmuffin should not look like to sources rig muffins then you go inside and it takes you another 20 minutes to get U dam order it's McDonald's for the love of God just pay attention I understand the pool that you have to pick from for help is very thin and limited,0
"The employee's are nice, location is always dirty. Tables have to be clean more often. The food quality has gotten better.",0
The problem is with these Mexican cashiers.When they have s Mexican customer they all know each other.So after they order.They chit chat.Even when it busy..plus they get better customer thsn the Whites do.And that to me is discrmmation,0
Used drive-thru around 2am just to find out that they were only taking cash because the card terminal was not working. I only had a few bucks cash to spend and I even got my oder wrong. Terrible experience!,0
Worst service I ever experienced. I ordered one thing but cashier decided to sell me double of what he thought was better. When I asked for my money back Angel the shift manager was very rude verbally and physically. I will never be going to that establishment again.,0
The food is cold and I continue to get the wrong order.,0
Well i order a crispy chicken sandwich small fry and a coke. Normally I look in the bag this time I just reached in for a fry. When I get home I find 10 piece nugget two BBQ sauces and a double cheese burger. I was to far to go back so I ate 5 nuggets and half the burger. Check your food people I was very disappointed but my dogs were thrilled.,0
"Dirty place, noisy employees and they took the order wrong",0
"Too much tarter sauce on fish fillet
Cheeseburger buns hard & stale",0
"Worst customer service ever!! I was invited to come in after having to wait over 45 minutes on the drive thru. Manager Priscilla calls me to apologize and invites me back with my family, I explained I cannot come back next day, but would come following Sunday, she agreed and hung up. On Sunday I come to the restaurant and there is another manager Cynthia who I explained the situation and she grunted the whole time she took the order. While on the service line, she tries to contact the manager and right there from behind the line, she asks me yelling, what is your name, I tell her and again in front of EVERYONE, other customers included, yells again, ""she tells me you came in already!!"" I replied NO, at this point I'm embarrassed and upset and I hear her that she tells the person on the phone I already put it down. Twenty minutes later, I finally get the order. I ask her to change the fries on some of the things that were ready because they were cold. The manager grunts and agrees to. After my family were done with their meals, we had ordered ice cream and we asked to hold off until we were done. When we returned, we asked for the ice cream and we had asked for chocolate, they said that we had ordered vanilla and the manager gave us one less of what we ordered. Incredible! Bottom line, we were invited to come back to make it up for bad service and McDonald's came through, we got yelled at by the manager, embarrased, long wait for food, missing food items, and pissy attitude by staff. Next time I get invited back I guess I gotta read the fine print or ask for what am I invited to come back for. Sorry that we don't have negative stars because this location would take them all.",0
McDonald's seems to be the meeting place for homeless and mentally ill people in NYC. I don't know why ?,0
No electric outlets to charge phones!!!!  This McDonald location is falling back hard. The staff have very poor work ethics. Tattoos and lack of respect are prominent here.,0
Poor ,0
No Hot n' Spicys? Employees are not there to assist customers.,0
Who idea was it to destroy the famous zoo McDonalds ??? I hope revenue sales go down the drain.,0
"If I  could give this location a zero on customer service, I  would. Pulled into drive through at 8:07 and placed a simple order. I order a regular hamburg and cookies. Once I paid and pulled up to the window to pick up, I  was told to pull up to the #1 space. I sat there and sat there and.........25 minutes later, no order. I  went in and no one was at the counter. I yelled ""hello"" three times. A young lady came up asking who was handling the front counter. A young girl appeared. To make this complaint shorter, I  showed my receipt and another 5 minutes later I got my order. There was another order with a drink sitting on the counter that never got to the person who ordered it. After getting home, I  had no regular hamburg but had cookies. Everyone, don't even bother going to this location again. It's a horrible experience every time as you can see by other reviews.",0
"Unreal, this mcdonalds is garbage. It was cool when it had zoo themed but came back home to visit to find my favorite mcdonalds right off the highway near the new tarnished. Service is always lackluster at best and usually can be very messy inside since the remodel",0
"My son got a vanilla milkshake it looked soupy and he tasted it and he said it had a off taste to it I told him throw it away, in a few minutes he was sick to his tummy . So beware .",0
You know why this McDonalds is rated so low? It's because they have 6 ITEMS ON THE MENU EXCLUDING FRIES AND DRINKS! This place is trash! Had to wait 30 minutes in line just go get 2 quarter pounders and 2 fries! If you're in Miami I'm warning you do not go here! There's much better places in Miami to eat then this garbage.,0
Only as a last resort,0
"The only reason I give this place a one is because there isn't a 0 option this is the WORST McDonald's I've ever been to.  The staff is RUDE.  We had to wait 20 minutes to order when there wasn't anyone else in line.  Couldn't use the bathroom until we showed a receipt and then there was no toilet paper.  A worker brought paper towels up,  said there was no toilet paper and let his girlfriend jump in line in front of me to use the bathroom. Couldn't even get in the men's bathroom the door was locked and you couldn't get in there.  Told the staff about it and they could care less I've never been treated so poorly.  The guy that was guarding the stairs to the bathroom was a poor excuse for an employee and McDonald's is wasting their money on paying someone to treat customers poorly.",0
Fries were cold and I ordered a Large size ($2.80+tax) that was only filled half way. I asked them if they could please fill them up and she literally put just a few more on top and when I stood it up it was just a little over half way now. They wouldn't even pass the edge of the front part. When I showed it to her she got annoyed and closed the window. Very rude employees,0
"Use the drive through to order. The girl gave me the wrong flavor soda. I told her what i ordered and she gets angry and says ok, pull up to the next window for your soda.
I say no, I'll wait here, please just give me my soda. She would rather argue then just fill the cup with soda. She tells me that I'm making everyone in the drive through wait. I said no McDonald's sloppy order taking is making me wait. I encourage everyone to not pull up out of the way when fast food restaurants screw up. They do that so ""corporate"" doesn't yell at them for having slow initial order to window pickup time. Do the job right and orders will be fast.",0
"Pretty bad salad. This was the second time the salad was not fresh at all. Turning brown.
Manager was nice enough to have another one made and refund. But not worth the wait.",0
They missed half my order and I tried giving them a call but they sent me straight to voicemail or would answer and just leave the phone there this is by far the worst food chain I have ever been to and pretty much just stole my Money,0
This is not the worlds biggest McDonald,0
"Bad service. Messed up my order. I tried to call them to get my money back they never picked up the phone, just bad service overall! Never going there again.",0
"I ordered from McDonald's and I did not receive my Sausage Egg McMuffin.
The previous times that I have ordered from this location..they have messed up my order.",0
Waited in line 30 minutes,0
Just cheap meal,0
"The employees just kept screaming the n word. I wasn even trying to eat here, I was just walking by. A",0
"This place sucks. 10 minutes for my order. The expeditor said someone else took my order. It was never given to me. When i get home, i dont see nugget sauce in the bag. Horrible service. While waiting for my order I observe the expeditor throwing food away becuase she messed up the order without serving it yet. Nobody touched it yet, why throw it away.",0
"My son got a vanilla milkshake it looked soupy and he tasted it and he said it had a off taste to it I told him throw it away, in a few minutes he was sick to his tummy . So beware .",0
Dirty,0
Poor ,0
Save yourself the trouble,0
There was not a long wait in the drive thru but the food was cold and stale.   Fries un salted and cold fish sandwich was dry and sad.   Will not be going back,0
Worse.. services,0
this sucks I can not even see car move 10 stars no wait 1 STAR BECAUSE THIS SUCKS not geting on this map thing AGIN I hate it,0
"McDonald's quality, What can I say the quality taste and preparation have gone straight down the toilet. Of the 3, taste is suffered the most. there.  fries used to be the best now they're the worst  It's so bad I try to use McDonald's as a last resort.      The last resort",0
Bad service gave us sparkling water instead of sprite also it takes about 45 minutes to just get a vanila cone and your food,0
Long wait and 3manger on duty and one person line. Then to fine out no fish at certain time bk at all times,0
I walk into the store in Roanoke TX and the employee is sitting on the counter and leaning on the cups with his but touching them I wonder where else he's been sitting at maybe where the food is made.,0
"Really didn't care much for the area...

Homeless people in and outside of this restaurant. (Not that I dont like them) but made me feel very uncomfortable eating meal with my small child. The lady that took my order overcharged me.... The food tasted great. Even put a Happy meal toy with my big Mac .. but I'm not complaining everyone loves Olaf!  Restaurant has recently been remodeled and seemed fairly clean. I probably won't go back. But it was okay.",0
"Good morning, Please tell me if this matters or if I'm being to sensitive or petty or overly concerned. Maybe because I didn't have my coffee this morning.

I patronize this McDonalds in Oak Park every morning. This morning I forgot my wallet. I asked the Supervisor if I could pay them the less than $5.00 breakfast tomorrow. They said so sorry No. I pleaded with this new manager that I'd never seen before. I asked for the manager that I'd spoken with on several occasions.
She refused to see me, and he stated that her response would be the same!!! I asked him what was to happen to food on the counter in front of us. He said it would be discarded!!!!

Seriously, I asked. So, I said that you'd rather throw it away then let me have it, a faithful customer.....So my lesson is now, Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson. McDonalds doesn't care about my patronizing their establishment and I'm going to seriously break my coffee habit. No more McDonalds from Oak Park on Madison for me.
A lesson well learned, can you believe my feeling was hurt when he said that my breakfast was to be discarded.",0
Unless u got a half-hour to spend in the drive thur.  Go for it .,0
"burgers are like rubbers, they taste awful, i felt i am eating not fresh bread. chicken was stretchy , looks like it was made to last for ever.",0
Pulled up to the drive through. Never got anyone to take my order. Car pulls into other com spot instantly get order taken. I wait some more a second and third car goes through the order. I sat there 3 or 4 minutes and 3 cars on the other side before I pulled away. Never had this problem at this before and I go here once a week bc I work down the road. But I will not return because it's nonsense. The car before me in that lane got there order through no problem.,0
"Worst McDonald on planet earth!! Sloppy service, dirty, limited selection on the menu. I believe mc Donald is losing millions with this place.
Once I ordered a double quarter pound and got a single. Once I ordered a single and got a double. One night I order a quarter pound but they had no more so I order a cheese burger and had no more I just left the place.
Also after a certain time they only serve large meals, no small nor medium.",0
"Went thru the drive thru, for breakfast. I like the Egg McMuffin meal, but that is about the only thing I'll eat off of their menu. My meal with a coke, ended up being wrong. They gave me a sausage biscuit and the coke was horrible. The line was so long, that I did not have time to wait, so I just threw it all away. I won't be coming back to this location.",0
I bought two hamburgers it cost me $6,0
Be careful. Rude sketchy employees.They will try to tell you at certain times of nite every order has to be upsized to a large. Food was cold and horrible after a long wait. Then you still will be  GROSSLY OVERCHARGED. Crooks. USE THE APP TO BE CHARGED CORRECTLY.,0
Would leave zero stars but I can. The food is nasty. Re dropped fries and burgers that have been in the heater all day. Only good thing is the lobby stays clean with,0
EVERY TIME THEY FORGET SOMETHING. And i mean everytime. I have heard conversations about general nonsense take priority over customers while waiting. The employees generally juat dont seem to care with the exception of a few,0
"""Open 24 hours"" we got here at 2.30 am and they say it's not open until 3.30 am. Finally they open at 3.40 am but they wouldn't accept cards, only cash. Then the girl at the cashier, Heidi she said, was attending the register and then going to the kitchen, no gloves, touching the food, so rude and so loud, terrible service here today.",0
We had to literally argue with the shift Supervisor to get more creamer and sugar for my coffee. Ill never go there again!,0
Worst people ever. The girls were being rude for no reason. The zoo theme outside is very nice but the customer service was the worst. We asked a question and she slammed the window on us,0
Start delibertly took too long and treatdd us poorly,0
"2 different visits: The supervisor in the grey shirt was the one give out the food with an attitude like he didnt want to be bothered. And I ordered 4 apple pies at night and all of them were old, dried out, and their box had no sell by time stamped so who knows how long they been in that warmer. Probably will place my food orders elsewhere",0
"Unbelievable that everyone else has the same complaint as me...they never get the order right.

Tonight, I realized that they forgot an item after coming home with food for the family. I first tried to call just to get reimbursed...but no one answered the phone.

Then I decided to drive back for a refund while the rest of my food went cold on my dining room table. When I got to the drive thru, I politely asked for a refund for the item they forgot.

Having worked in the food industry myself in the past, the service was awful. For the sheer inconvenience, they should have refunded me and at least offered the missing item to me free of charge. However, all that was given was a refund...not even an apology to go along with it.

Terrible service along with the terrible cold food that I then had to go eat at home (thanks to my having to drive back for a refund).

Mistakes can happen but not as often as they happen here. Do yourselves a favor and avoid this location!!!",0
Bad communication when ordering through the drive-thru. When I recommend this place if customer service is important to you.,0
"Ordered 3 sandwiches and received only bread, no meat no cheese. Only noticed when I got home. Congrats ",0
Probably the worst McDonald's I've ever been in.,0
Today they see me inside waiting for orden and no body attend me today 7/22/21 time 6:27 am they look at me 3 time and don't ask can I help you..and the male manager he see me and ignore me..I like this mcdonal I'm the truck driver I coming every day but this male is not good..and  I left with hungry..!!!,0
Do not go here for lunch worst service in Los Angeles and dirty restaurant gross Cashiers have attitudes and never get your order right two thumbs down and negative stars just stay your lazy behind home if you don't want to work and do your job right.,0
This garbage for 3.91 imagine,0
Had to say hello at the drive thru over and over to get anyone to take an order .   And of course they had no ice cream,0
"Very nasty tables & Floor. I asked the manager if someone could clean she handed me a wet cloth and said person that cleans is on break. I ended up eating in my car . Very horrible experience, ManagenMan needs reviewing.",0
They  hardly speak English they serve you Whit and attitude and they are always more concentrated in talkin about fellow workers that they are to take your order and that's why they always give you the wrong stuff.,0
Ok,0
"Absolutely done with this location, I always seem to get the same woman at the drive-thru I don't know her name but I know her voice and she screws up every single time then when I try and correct her she gets mad and acts like it's my fault. I don't know if she's special needs or something or there's a learning disability or if she's hard of hearing I don't get it. And even lately when I hear it's her I actually make sure to enunciate clearly but it doesn't seem to help. The young man that I occasionally get is always on point he has never messed up an order. I'm guessing she is related to management or has incriminating photos or something. She has absolutely no people skills and I will not go back to this place",0
"Do you know the 3 and 7 ? You said 3, but it was 7, and 7 of course took it away. So where is my 3? it took me another 20 mins.",0
Lobby is closed often for seemingly unknown reasons.,0
"Packed of people, orders taking forever",0
"Very rude and nasty people at the inside counter; no help or patience for people who are old and not computer savvy. At the drive through, they messed up my order and charged me for what I hadn't ordered. The lady manager was nice though.",0
By far the worst McDonald's I've ever been to.  Food was gross and the place is dirty.  Save yourself and don't come here.,0
What an awful place. Unless I am desperate I will never return here.,0
"The food is ok. The price is ok. If you go through the drive through, they always make you pull forward because your food isn't ready yet.",0
"Horrible customer service, if I could do 0 stars I would. No receipt and the food cold",0
"Be a Careful with this Store
He charged me $1.39 + tax for a coffee. I remained him about McDonald's coffee price ($1.09+tax). But he said no & I back to my car, took more money then paid. (Store no. 4324, receipt 300, date feb.22/16 mon. 20:25)",0
Gery bad service,0
Awful food,0
"The morning crew seems fast and efficient. Night crew is a whole different experience, lines down the street, hour long waits. If this was a one time occurrence it wouldn't be so bad but this is a nightly problem. Beyond this the staff is so highly rude you leave wanting to crash your car through the building. Don't forget they will mistake your order almost every single time as well and serve it to you cold.",0
Poor ,0
Food is always cold and takes forever.,0
This has GOT to be the worst McDonald in America. I live next ,0
"Terrible at the night. Staff is unfriendly and sometimes rude, when after 40 minutes of waiting, I asked where my order was, a guy named Gustavo just turned away and left.  They say that they have a lot of orders and few people.  Firstly, at least two people there only did what they went back and forth, but they could help other employees to speed up the process.  But my god, why should the service suffer from this?  Hire more people for the weekend.  Or did you not guess that people come to you on Saturday night? Supervisors need to conduct trainings for staff, otherwise they forgot how to communicate with customers and how the company makes money.  And in the end, where is your smile?  Or are the good old days of smiling gone?",0
Short of help and check your bag for accuracy.,0
I asked for fresh fries and nuggets. They were not fresh and I did not receive any sauce. This place is terrible.,0
"The Service is bad in special the drivetrue they never give the food correct and management are worse that the bad service that people receive they do not know the meaning of customer service. That McDonald's need to change does managers or give them a good training in customer service, courtesy and Ethical!",0
"Food tastes gross been eating healthy too long figured I would try them out it has been probably 10 years since I had McDonald's chicken products. It was either old or they figured out how to Nuke girl Chicken in about 30 seconds either way slightly concerning LOL.

this is only a review of the food quality the service at this location seem great and if we could rate businesses categorically then they would have received five stars for customer service and speed",0
"When I'm up early in the morning,I can't stop there for early meals,so I'm lead to go to 711 store.",0
"Absolutely disgusted with discriminatory management at this location. As I'm charging my phone in back making an order on app because I didnt have my card. The manager, Nancy, request their ""security"" to kick me out. I did absolutely nothing wrong other than charge my phone to make an order.

Not only did their security guard get rude with me they didnt even have the professionalism to let me know it's against rules to charge phone to make an order. Only was charging to phone to make order thru app. Then after getting kicked out they wouldn't give me a refund or my food, said to call number.

Me being black I deal with this a lot. But I hope reviews like this can help wake people up and hold people accountable for discriminatory behavior.

Still want my refund!!!",0
Ickey.  Nasty.   Supppse to smell food. Not piss  workers.  Are. Unreal  i will never. Go to this one EVER again,0
"The person who cleans is completely dirty, poorly dressed and smells bad. Besides, he started yelling at us for sitting for 5 minutes to choose the menu, he even threatened to call the police, he literally ran us out of there, the moment I went to place my order the cashier treated us very badly, I do not recommend it to anyone, the worst McDonald's in New York.
The person who cleans is completely dirty, badly dressed and smells bad aside we started to scream for sitting 5 minutes to choose the menu, even threatened to call the police, we literally ran out of there, the moment I went to place my order the cashier treated us very poorly, I would not recommend to anyone the worst McDonald's in New York.",0
Why would you ask me when im ordering if i want any condiment if ur just going to forget them. Fries are raw and my sandwich patty was hard but yet they still some how managed to smush the sandwich in half. Atlest they wore able to get the drink right.,0
"Absolutely unprofessional staff, disorganized, and angry. They were so angry and SCREAMING out the numbers into a girl's face angrily. They were talking about jumping a girl. And when I went to order I took a second to take my phone out to show her the deal I wanted and she snapped at me and said HELLO and repeated my order and said OKAY?! I said yeah but I have a deal I want to use. She waved it off and said ""it don't work"". She was snapping her fingers and voice. I literally just got there and she was just already angry standing there. I took my card out to use and she said ""You have cash? That don't work!"" As if I knew. She didn't state it beforehand. What I didn't understand was everyone else before me ordered with a card? So I just told her I don't have cash and walked off the line. I saw people using their cards and when I saw that I got upset. I just got done working a long day and I was tired and hungry and just wanted my McChicken and fries. I got back on line and there was her friend. The friend told me to insert my card. I asked her if it works she said yeah. I said so WHY did the other lady tell me otherwise? Then the lady saw me on line again she said ""I just told her the app don't work why is she asking again?!"" I said ""Actually, you also said the card reader doesn't work and it does so I wouldn't know what's true or not?"" She said ""WHO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE TALKING TO?!"" ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE SERVICE. They both started laughing. There was a pretty big spider walking around on the floor too. All the tables were dirty. And the guy cleaning was on his phone and rapping. And looking at other customers butts. She handed me the food harshly. They're all children. Immature children. Absolutely disrespectful.",0
One of my orders was missing and one burger was not completely  cook,0
Zoo McDonald's need more help after midnight!!!,0
Terrible,0
Be very prayerful and careful in this area.. HIGHLY DRUG INFESTED ,0
The worstest McDonald's in all of America and they have a armed guard always nonsense there  cold food stale and hard nerve no sauces always mistake orders too many foreign immigrants work there drive thru  Is an half an hour late junkies asking you for money and Brittany is a chickenhead.,0
We specifically asked for Ranch but Ranch was not given,0
"This Mc Donald's it's always really slow. Simple orders like a Quarter Pound and Mc Nuggets can take forever. I'm already waiting 40 minutes on Curbside Pickup and nothing. It already happened sometimes, I will not come back to this Mc Donald's anymore. Terrible customer service.",0
Worst Mc Donalds ever visited!!! The worst service and quality!,0
Started at drive thru and started ordering food at first able to hear the lady but after I order my first thing I could not really hear her and then when I got my food it was wrong.,0
"Slow!!!!  Haven't tried the food yet, since I am min minute 32 of waiting for my FAST food",0
"Just went and got 4 McChicken, 1 Large French fry a medium one and a cheeseburger.

The entire order was old. French fries were saggy like and old lady titis. The McChicken tastes like they were cooked a month ago. Aaaah wait no coke because the machine was down. First is the shake machine and now the coke. Come on man. Worst MCDONALD Ever fuuuuck",0
It took 18 minutes to get two cheeseburgers and a Coke,0
Poor ,0
homeless are very agressive and smoking pot demanding money at drive through.,0
Well they have problem with order to receive time mostly because of crowd.,0
The worst drive through experience in miami,0
"Almost everything I order was wrong. I order a Sunday with chocolate syrup, and they brought me caramel. I also order and paid extra for bbq sauce, and they didn't put any; the food was also cold!  Worst restaurant!",0
My order was in correct and cold.,0
"Bed service very bad manager
He",0
You guys messed up my order wish you would have told me you had apple pay i wasted twenty mins of my life to get my coffee and you put 3 creams instead of 3 sugars I hate you forever now lol,0
"I got a sundae and My sundae got knocked over when I went to sit down , I asked the manager in the picture below for a new shake and he said it no refills. So I퐉 explaining to him that I퐉 not getting a refill my sundae fell at the table and he keeps yelling 퐎ead the sign ? I tried giving him the sundae  back i",0
It's ok.the service stinks took too long,0
If I can give this place ZERO stars I would! I went through drive through and cashier informed me to wait on line 1. So I drove and parked while I was waiting a lot of vehicles passed through. There was an older lady with red hair giving out deliveries of food so I was wondering when my order was going to come out waiting there for 30minutes or Longer. So I walked inside asking for my order and come to find out that my order was given to someone else! So they had to put my order again through the system so I can get my food so again Now I had to wait for others to come out before mine because my order was last in line. Food wasn't warm once I got it and fries had salt when I ordered no salt. Never coming to this place again if your near by this location I recommend going to the McDonald's on 183 by Taco Bell.,0
Food is typical for McDonald's. I decided to eat in but alarms were loud and constant the entire time I was there. Several people working and ignoring the various buzzers and chimes. This will keep me from returning.,0
"Hours are wring and they were closed when I went. Usually they're alright, bit not the best McDonald's.",0
Worse mcd I been too.,0
"RUDE,  SLOW, AND GOT ORDER WRONG. Don't come to this McDonald's a expect fast,or friendly  ZERO STARS!!!!!",0
"beware, only accepts cash",0
"Complicated kiosk ordering, salty fries (can order lightly salted) decent but too much sodium in the hamburgers.  Good for in a pinch or for a quick bite.",0
"Went for a pick up and took over 20 minutes to get the food, Three other customers got there after me and got their food before me.",0
"I had revise my earlier review, left underneath this new one.

Just had the most bizarre experience. The lady who took my money at the first window seemed to have a problem with me wanting my change back. She FOLLOWED me to the other window, and started harassing me BETWEEN the barriers meant to stop the spread of Covid 19. Multiple times she stuck her face between the windows to berate me. She asked me what else I was waiting for after I got my drink. As I had just given her my money, she shouldn't be handling my food at all, much less trying to talk to me and knew I had a burger. She then closed the window, and started throwing a coniption that I couldn't hear. The then reopened the windows, stuck her face between the barriers and told me she knew what I had ordered. I told her I didn't understand, and she shoved her face further out and repeated she knew what my order was again, closer and more loudly. I don't get it, I've been here many times and gotten my food without any problems. This young lady not only made the food leave a bad taste in my mouth, but she is exposing people to the potential life threatening virus for no reason. Very very poor attitude and dangerous actions because I wanted my change?

Great, they have really turned things around in the last couple years. The service used to be slow and highly inconsistent. These days, despite all the challenges the restaurant industry has faced they overcame whatever had been stopping them from providing the McDonald's Standard, fast food with correct orders. Not sure if they got new management, training, or equipment, but these guys have brought back the Gold (Arch) Standard. Great job team!",0
Poor service,0
Service was awful,0
"I wouldn't recommend McDonalds food to anyone for what should be obvious reasons . Stopping there was not my idea. Although, charging only a BUCK for a large soft drink was avery, very, very SMART move.  I'm sure millions go in to purchase a pop/soda & end up spending maybe on average say $5.00",0
The worst McDonald and cust,0
it's a McDonalds,0
"Working for doordash in that area, and everytime I go to pick up a order.  I wait over 30 minutes atleast.  People are just standing around and doing nothing.  I even asked who the manager is, and the lady pointed to the guy sitting down eating.  This hasn't just happened once, it has happened every time!  I don't like to accept orders from McDonald because of this, but I have to make money.  This place needs to get their stuff in gear.  It's a busy place and not really any competition.",0
"Slow late night weekend workers,especially the female worker,it seems like she doesn wanna work,highly doubt any s",0
"Worse McDonald's I've been to. I have decided to go a mile further to the Augustine Dr one instead at this point. Constantly slow, missing items or not making them correctly. Ordered for curbside at 8pm, was told restaurant was closed and I need to contact corporate for a refund",0
They were not letting homeless people eat or use the bathroom that we're buying food that's wrong,0
Chicken sandwiches just lazily thrown together.  Looks really sloppy.  Have to take apart and line it all up and spread out the veggies.  Your typical McDonald's.,0
"It's dark. It's dirty. Carry your own napkins cuz they only give you 1 or 2. Everytime I've gone, the tables have been filthy, so have something to wipe them down. The food is always good though.",0
Too expensive for fast food that isnt very good. Not always fresh.,0
"Worst service, terrible food, especially when receiving wrong order & employee had attitude.",0
Always a bad experience here! The manager is so unprofessional and rude. I used to be a manager in McDonald and clearly wouldn argue with a customer about a free coffee because of a app problem. In,0
I did the Drive though the food was warm and it was turn off .,0
"Very ,very , bad service never coming back",0
Hands down the slowest service I have EVER seen at ANY fast food restaurant.,0
"This is the second time I've came to this McDonald's and they are closed. How you 24 hours but closed. They very rude. Last time they told me they open at 7am in the drive thru, then this morning I was told 6:30am. I come to this one because it's so close to my house. But it seems I'm going have to find another one. This McDonald's need a manager and someone who can be in charge and know how to handle a restaurant. When I come to this McDonald's I always spend $40 or better. Get y'all stuff together",0
"Service was slow, attitudes were awful and the quarter pounder was horrendous (the coke was still awesome though).",0
Drive thru employee extremely rude and told us we'd need to wait as long as she needed to take,0
"Bad service in the disgusting place of churre, the supervisors who have to set an example, just gossip and speak ill of the clients, I don't know how the owners do not come as a surprise. There are people who really deserve the job. Hygiene shines. .hand sanitizer empty",0
"Same as any other Mc Donald's in the world, a lot of the homeless comunity visits there so it's good to always give them a hand",0
Terrible,0
I would  Give this McDonald's 0 stars if I could they don't only forget your sauces for your nuggets but they give you a Burger with a paper still on the Patty cooked with cheese on it. I bit into my Burger and I chewed it right away I tasted the paper.. Took my Burger apart and found the paper that's on the Burger Patty before it's cooked . Be more careful. People could get sick if they eat that.  It would be nice if I could get my money back for this.,0
Terrible,0
Their ubereats need to be more attention to detail n packed nice not just thrown in always missing something i asked for bought the big breakfast meal and got sent no silverware no syrup nothing like Damn how am i going to eat this i even put a note in the app to add napkins and condiment n still can't receive it what's the point of leaving a note if no one reads it I've order different times and never fail to disappoint me,0
Employee's here are RUDE & DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR JOBS,0
"drive thru is hell!!!! if you are thinking to go thru the drive thru... are you willing to spend 15-20 min?!?!? hell to the no! not just the drive thru is the issue but the fries is burnt and stiff, the coke is FLAT! also make sure to have cash because they will surprise you ""at the moment we are not accepting card payment"" pretty much thats my experience here...",0
They mess up my order alot and employee's act like its my fault. That and after midnight they don't want to take your credit card. Always claiming the system is down.,0
Worst service ever waited at the counter 20 mins manager said be would be right there currently still waiting while review like dam can I get my Mcflurry. Manager seen in photo ,0
Poor ,0
"Lobby ordering is only open M-F 11am-2pm. Without a car for drive up window or App, you are out of luck. I",0
Would've eaten there if there wasn't a homeless man sitting their loitering and making the dining area smell like piss.,0
Went through the drive-thru order to fillet a fish and a small fry one fillet of fish was hot the other flat fish was cold french fries are soggy,0
"This is hands down THE worst McDonald's ever! The staff are rude, racist, and intentionally slow. Don't waste your time. There was a fistfight in the dining area and the men's room was full of weed smoke.",0
You can't ask a question because they answer badly a lady answered me in a bad way lousy service they should supervise so that those kinds of things don't happen,0
Takes too long to get your order. The person  taking your money always look mad.,0
The worst McDonald's I have been to across Texas!,0
Worst service wrong order,0
"They seemed overwhelmed at lunch in Drive thru. Very slow. Then when at window was asked to pull forward when simply ordering a number 2 with nothing special added? Seriously, a quarter pounder takes extra time to make? Now I remember why I dislike McDonalds.",0
"Frys were cold, did not give me my large drink that was ordered, and when I asked for my receipt, 3 people just walked around lost.. said forget it and left.",0
Food was barely edible,0
"Worst mc Donald in America. They have lots homeless people inside the place ,very dirty not well coordinated even thought it's in a good location for business. The management have to do something about it.",0
"There is no way to rate your establishment, very  disheartening due to we were on the road and needed to sit and rest before getting back on, also need to use the restroom. Food was great, but can't really give proper rating cause of this. I enjoy McDonald's, but I getting a bit feed up with the dining closure everywhere. Please do not reply due to pandemic, and safety, due to other establishment being open. I travel a lot on the road and soon will be passing up every McDonald's due to this. I stop because of the Kids. Disheartening once again.",0
My Mc.Nuggets where burnt after a 45 minute wait and i was told to wait in the speaker i recommend going to 1024 E Anderson Ln,0
"Terrible, unhealthy, poison, deadly",0
Need more respectable Associates,0
The worst McDonald's restaurant service ever! The food was disgusting. Will never visit this location again.,0
"Ordered via the kiosk.

Looks like management has posted a sign, order via kiosk to get a free cookie. My order didn't contain one. I asked the associate, she was puzzled. They had to discuss with 3 other folks and finally one of them gave one with complete displeasure.

Kiosk didn't give a paper bill to provide a direct feedback. With modern tech, they should switch to a sms or email for whoever wants a digital copy.",0
Horrible,0
They have music as if it were a disco. Here you can not eat you go crazy.,0
"Epic McDonald's on International dr. Is lacking customer service.  Had the coupon for free Happy Meal from Visit Florida.  They didn't want to give it to us because we downloaded from site and printed not from tourist booklet.  Then said it was not actually for a happy meal.  Just drink, fries, and burger/nuggets. "" No box, toy, yoghurt or toy""  even though the coupon stated ""HAPPY MEAL""  no small print.  Girl at drive thru wasn't nice.  Prices at epic McDonald's are quite a bit higher than the other locations and no $1,2,3 menu",0
"This location is incredible. It has two stories. Has automated machines to order from. You can get a variety of different items to try out that aren't at regular McDonald's. It's always super busy here too so expect a wait.

I'm a local and I decided to try something different when a friend was visiting so we came here and ordered pizza. I was so sick for the next three days that I couldn't leave bed. Never again.",0
Staff are jerks and are inconsiderate don't ever have the lobby open then gets mad when people that don't have a car go up to drive through,0
Horrible ,0
"I dont eat breakfast without mac sauce, they have given me mac sauce with my breakfast before but now they won't, so no breakfast for me. Lost a sale because their to lazy to open up some mac sauce... just wows me.",0
Like all the other McDonald's they're expensive underpaid understaffed and they close too early but that's because they're understaffed,0
Dine in closed and no access to public restrooms smh all bad,0
"Unacceptable, I ordered 2 Kids Meal from the drive thru from this location I didn't get the Nuggets for both kids meals, I went into the restaurant to speak with an employer they refused to replace my the missing items. my kids were unhappy. Having to pay and not receiving your complete order especially the main meal is unsatisfactory... Never coming to this Mc Donald's",0
This is the WORST McDonald ever!! I wouldn even give them 1 star if I didn,0
Don't like mcd,0
They  hardly speak English they serve you Whit and attitude and they are always more concentrated in talkin about fellow workers that they are to take your order and that's why they always give you the wrong stuff.,0
I placed mobile order and went to drive thru to pick up and told me to park! I waited almost half an hour and my order was still incorrect. What's purpose of ordering on line if don't get it promptly?,0
Arrived starving from water park.30 minutes after ordering large order of food( no deals on that was on other branches) still no food so asked staff who said would look into it. 45 minutes later one staff arrived with sandwich only out of 4 meals and desserts saying rest coming. 1 hour later rest of order arrived no desserts and on checking burger brought was wrong. Went down to complain so called manager shrugged shoulders said other stuff sent up and was attitude of so what that was terrible service. Half machine for kids to play upstairs broke and ridiculous amount of tickets to get smallest prize. Will never be back. If u want mcdonalds go to smaller local branch as will have deals and hopefully better service.,0
very bad service,0
Could not go inside,0
The buttermilk crispy tenders are not crispy nor tender the meat is horrible the worst I've ever had why would I eat here when I can get some decent fries chicken and burgers at Culver's or some f the best fast food chicken from chik full ,0
I had not been here in a long time but that night the rest room was the most disgusting thing I ever seen. The food was descent even though I was working my Postmates.,0
Disappointed - claimed Egg Mc muffin deal was over and charged outlandish price! Service not great - wrong coffee received after ordering DECAF and NO cream given...,0
Terrible,0
It is the slowest fast food service ever!,0
"Ordered a Happy Meal, Large Fries, and Large Coke at the drive thru. Didn't get my receipt or change, large Sprite and no straw.",0
"I퐉 assuming this is the McDonald on celebrations so that I write this review under the correct McDonald on Celebrations...Manager name with a J I think it Jasmine or Judy I think it Judy but young lady was not professional(she is blonde and worked around 11pm 08/04/18).. I ordered my food in drive through when I got it the food was not good the meat was burnt, the bun was hard , the sandwich basically looked really old.. I came in told her the situation not once did she apologize for the horrible sandwich... I had to ask for a new sandwich to be made instead of her even suggesting it...she took the sandwich food preparation ..horrible food poor management needs to do better !!! Took my money and went else where..this McDonald will no longer be geting my service ",0
My cup was fingered by the cashier.   Two stars because he gave a new one when I asked.,0
"Was served about an hour-old stale fries.  have to order your fries unsalted at this location for a fresh batch.
McDonalds is all about fries...  Please don serve fries that been sitting out for an hour.  Even McDonald corporate has a rule of throwing away old batches every 7 min.  either understaffed or lazy.  Why even hire a manager or use a franchisee who doesn",0
Very loud. The managers kids and grandkids were running around the place and causing a mess. Very loud and took forever to get my food. I did not like this place one bit. Maybe if the kids weren't running around doing whatever they wanted itd be better. I recommend going to a different McDonald's their are a few others near by.,0
Literally locked the door on my face. I never write reviews but this was so strange. Was attempting to purchase breakfast and there was an employee who physically pushed me out and locked the door. Completely unwarranted given my calm demeanor. Very bizarre.,0
"Waited 48 minutes in line, and when it was my turn, they said they only take cash. They could have posted a sign somewhere. Awful.",0
"Repeatedly missing items. Repeatedly ignoring allergy restrictions such as simple specifics on orders like no onion, no cheese, etc. overnight is horrible. Overnight Manager identified herself as  crystal on 3/5/23 was not helpful and in better terms, an incompetent woman.",0
THE WORST MC DONALDS EVER!!!!!,0
Got hit up by a beggar with 30 seconds of parking.  Beggar then proceeded to move inside to converse with employees.,0
"I've never had so many orders be wrong in my life. I just tested 5 different orders over 5 days, all didn't times if day, yes I get board easily, and not a single one was right. Not little stuff like napkins, but like burgers, fries, and drinks missing. Yesterday it was a mc flurry. Before asking for it directly, I even asked (knowing they forgot it) ""am I missing anything"" and got a ""nope, you're good, have a nice day"" well, at least it was with a smile...",0
The service in the morning is terrible went there twice and I have to wait 12 to 15 minutes cuz there's no one at the front  they're all busy doing  . The second day I went there the guy that took my order completely ignore me until he left from his shift  a,0
The drive through line was extremely slow and they had the second lane lit up but didn't  wait on anyone. I sat there waiting then finally gave up because when I went to go in the other lane I had to go ba k around the building and by the time I got there there were 4 more cars ahead of me now.,0
Fries were stale and customer service was poor,0
Lao Mo's attitude towards ordering food is extremely bad! It doesn't matter if you look down on people like a dog leg! Staff with such an attitude please come too!,0
Terrible place......debit/credit machines are broken......not organize.......Security was helping the customers not the regular employees of McDonald,0
45 mins on a Thursday night.  Nothing makes sense anymore with everything being terrible and no sense of urgency in any aspect of this place.  Fire the whole crew from the manager on down and start over.,0
"Don't eat here! Order is always wrong, takes forever, fries are cold and gross. Dining room ""closes"" at 11pm. NOPE! Really closes at like 8pm. Update the hours on your door!!! When we knocked on the door and pointed to the sign, THE MANAGER FLIPPED US OFF!

Cooperate needs to fire most the staff, all the managers, and get new people in there.",0
"Food was slow to get and cold. And if you don't ask, no butter for your muffin  and no ketchup.  Very sad who works there.",0
Poor services!!,0
"Went through the drive-thru and had a pre-order. They rushed us through, they were busy, then when we took a bite we found out that the Sandwiches were completely wrong. Not even worth going back for. It's happened multiple times at this location.",0
"Wait time was horrible, food was cold as usual and the drive thru a always feels like a death trap.",0
I can believe how rude this people is,0
"On Nov 22//21, I went to use the men restroom and it was so filthy and because this is a place where a lot people visit the attention to the restrooms should be made more often",0
"So, I got to this location frequently, despite hearing the horror stories about this location, because it is close to me. Well, tonight my order was messed up and they yelled at me about it.
First, I tell the person taking my order that I would like a Bacon Double Quarter Pounder w/ Cheese, Tea for the drink, make the combo a large. So, the first thing we have a discussion about is that he gave me an unsweetened tea on the screen. I tell him I would like a sweet tea for the drink, and he tells me that I ordered it wrong. I said, ""Well, normally when I come here, they default to sweet tea."" I said that because they usually do  He said, ""Nah! That's not how we do it. Then, he clears the entire order and puts in a Quarter Pounder with Cheese.

I tell him that I ordered a Bacon Double Quarter with Cheese, sweet tea, and make the combo a large. I saw that it was not right on the screen, but he repeated the order to me correctly.  I pulled around to pay for the order and waited on it to be served to me. I checked the order and told the person at the window that it was not a double. The person at the window talked to the person who took my order, and he came to the window and yelled, ""I MADE WHAT YOU ORDERED."" I told him that I said ""double"" several times when I ordered, 5 times to be exact. He person who took my order, who looked to be a manager, yelled at me, ""NO! IT WAS THE WAY YOU ORDERED IT. YOU ASKED FOR A SINGLE.""

I repeated that I asked for a Bacon Double Quarter with cheese and he started arguing with me about how to order sweet tea. He finally told me that he would make it order, but I did not trust him at this point, so I said that I was leaving and I would not be back.

This was an awful experience and I will not be back. I will also tell my friends and family to avoid this location despite that it has served our community over 10 years.",0
I ordered a Big Mac meal sized medium and a 10 pc; I got a double cheeseburger and actually 5 McNuggets. Got robbed for nearly 10 dollars. Never again.,0
"I never ever go here because it's the most incompetent McDonald's I've ever seen operate. I ran the drive thru in NYC when I was 17 so I know a thing or two about the process and how it's really not rocket science but somehow they can't ever get it right. Unfortunately for me my husband picked up dinner for me from there and I very Unfortunately didn't specify which one to go to... although this one is closest to home I will drive all the way to Altamonte to avoid it, and the way gas prices are that should tell you all you all need to know. Tonight it was missing fries (we ordered a total of 6 whole items so I can see how that was overwhelming to this bunch) and freezing cold fries which I have no idea how you can even do since even if it been under the warmer for a while... stone cold fries? I wouldn't put it past them they kept them on a counter somewhere instead though. And on top of that I made the mistake of asking for extra pickles on my big mac which I'm sure put this kitchen in a frenzy so they just threw all the ingredients in the box so I can do my own assembling of it... which was probably for the best because who knows what chaos it would cause for them to assemble it. I would be embarrassed to own this place. Don't go here... I know it's fast food and we shouldn't expect much but Altamonte Mcds never dissapoints. Trust me it's worth the drive.",0
Rude employees,0
0 stars took 15 minutes to get a couple cheeseburgers and chicken tenders and they forgot our chicken nuggets,0
"Cold burgers disgusting looking and tasting meat, the fries were the only ",0
"I would like to put less than one star bit I can't.
Worst Mc ever been, if u want to eat something fast go on and find other places.
Not recommended.",0
The service was alful everyone working the front was either on there phone or joking around. They got my order wrong twice. New management is needed and a whole new crew to go with it.,0
Horrible!!! We waited 1 hour in line to get mediocre food. We were told they were understaffed,0
Just close it down. Worst service ever. It's a tourist based Mcdonalds so they know most customers are a one time customers. But I live in Miami Beach. I hate this place so much for lack of care and customer service. And they know corporate or management doesn't care. Makes me not want to go to any Mcdonalds anywhere at all.,0
Every two seconds the door flings open with another customer and you freeze to this cold weather. On top of that the bathrooms require a token to be inserted and can  be obtained by anyone at the registers free of charge. Meanwhile there are fully unlocked and working bathrooms on the second floor that everyone can use. The worse part was that the entire staff was Mexican and did not speak one word of English to each other. As a matter of fact they were laughing and having a great time in their own language while taking my order which is extremely rude to me and to other customers.,0
"It was really bad, the chicken wasn't good, didn't salt fries, forgot the sauce, and when I ask for it, he gave it to the person next to me!",0
The slowest service I have ever experienced. Even after ordering online I wait for far to long for pick up.,0
Horrible!!!!!  Food always cold fries cold JUST HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!,0
The hours say they are open at 5:00am but it's 5:30 and the doors are  locked. I have been waiting for half an hour and still not open only drive thru I don't have a car so thats not helpful.,0
"This rains on the wet, very bad attention and they take too long.",0
Literally the worst they literally never have working registers crazy wait times tonight they didn have food?? They said they wouldn have any food for another hr.. I work night shifts in the Area and they,0
ROACHES!!!!!!! Somebody call the health department! I told the manager and they acted like it was normal.  Disgusting!!!!,0
Tried calling to find out what the Happy Meal toy is today for grandson. The phone has been busy for 45 minutes. Must be off the hook. Going elsewhere.,0
"This has been one of the worst McDonald's I have been too. Not only where the to drive through lines extremely long, but then when we get to the window the person was confused with our order. We drive up to get our food and the person was pleasant enough. The food now left a lot to be desired. French fries were not fresh. They had zero salt. We ordered a 10 piece of chicken nuggets and got eight pieces. Then on top of that they're old and stale and cold. Needless to say we will never be going there again.",0
"On sight security
Nothin more to be said

4+ service tho",0
"This location is wack.
They will literally stop taking orders and make people sit in the parking lot for like 12 minutes until 3:00 a.m. so that they don't get to order dinner food anymore.
We have gone multiple times right after leaving the pinballz arcade just to sit in the parking lot in the Drive-Thru line waiting while they do nothing but wait for the order menu to change over.
Look McDonald's if I wanted a breakfast deluxe I wouldn't have shown up at 2:30 in the morning thank you.",0
"Ordered 2 cheeseburgers with no pickles. I got 2 burgers with no cheese and pickles. The establishment itself was clean kept and had a nice interior update to it. The soda machine is a touch screen and you can add flavor shots to it if you'd like. So, if you like Russian Roulette, this might be the McDonalds for you.",0
The employees at this location are ridiculously lazy. It's 6pm and the drive-thru menu is still on the breakfast side. It shouldn't take more than 2 minutes to flip the menu over to the lunch side.,0
"Having to pay for a cup of water is outrageous. $2 for a cup of water should not be the norm. Who do they think they are, Nestle?",0
Poor ,0
The manger was so very rude and service sticks,0
weak place  ridiculous attitudes working there. Got order wrong   and the two in front of me.    Mgrs are in wrong position  -  its McDonalds. Enough said.,0
"After 2 hours at customs... Nothing better than a cheeseburger that you will bitterly regret for the next 2 hours on the road.
He is in a terrible state.",0
"Tooooo slow, rudeness, not a scence of customer service, restrooms are horrible and the wait is over 30 minutes.",0
Good quick service! But the lady that works at night front counter is very rude. It's a way to say something. People are spending their money.,0
Didn't have any more packs of peanuts for the sundaes... Disappointing and this is at 7 pm!,0
"I live close so I frequent this location. They almost always get my very simple order wrong and they can't even use the most basic forms of respect such as speaking to a customer. They just take the card, hand it back(most of the times without the receipt) and at the next window hand you your incorrect order without so much as a word. Head a few miles down A1A and get much better service with a friendlier staff.",0
Ordered a Big Mac with bacon didn't get the bacon on it. Fries were cold. And the gentleman inside was spitting in the trash can ill never go back again,0
They are very very ghetto...they take 4ever to do orders too....no kind of customer service...need to have customer training service...too many youngsters....orders are always a mess up...need to be aware of folks coming up to your car asking for change...service is slow inside too....,0
Probably the worst McDonald's restaurant I know. They can't manage to get any orders right and I've sat in their drive thru on several occasions for a few minutes with nobody covering it. Terrible,0
It wsas a bad service for a breakfast just waiting for 10minutes in line to order,0
Food was so bad ,0
"The good thing is that is open 24. They do not have enough personnel. Food was just okay, help us survive till the next morning.",0
Gave order in the drive thru lady wasn't paying attention on what I wanted mind you I only ordered 3 things had to repeat myself 3 more times at the window then they still get my order wrong never again,0
Alma does not fit the proper image or the standards of a manager.  From hickey's to over excessive make up and unprofessionalism,0
Worst service I've ever had waited over 45 minutes in the drive thru for a 10 peice nugget meal..... workers didn't seem to know what there job was!!! Manager looked lost by what it appeared from the window.,0
Wait time at 2am in drive thru is ridiculous.,0
Homeless people smelling too bad asking for money and food while you trying to eat and nobody does anything ... ,0
The customer service is just not what it used to be. There is no Welcome to McDonalds just how can i help. I ended up payimg for someone elses order. At 1st i thought it was more but it was 20 cents less. I'm glad i only go there for drinks.,0
I always take long. And always mess up on your orders.,0
Well what can I say I use to work mc Donalds and their custermer  service  was great I went to drive through  tonight no one help me on the speaker so I drove  to the window the cashier tell no that will need to go back in line and order again that he could get my order at the window I was in line for good 10 15 mn then I go to  the window to talk to manger nothing and he just left to the back and ignored  the custermer in the front he was asking for him to get him something  he did not get any help he left I drove up then he was not there at all with a big line I went back to the drive thru and well to oder then he tel their is no ice scream so I get inline again for nothing had to stay in line until they served every one in front and again no one in the windows to help  but just the some  need to ck cause I have it all in video  I will posting it on line to she how horrible  custermer service  Mc Donald's  have compare to Chick-fil-A  they don't come close of the quality  and custermer service they have and people need to start speaking about  Mc how not only tge drive thru people wait for 20 to 30 mn some all the pollution but that's another story I hope this makes some ck this out,0
disapointed ,0
"The dirtiest McDonold I have ever been. Waited for 8 mins with no one to serve even though 2 staffs were standing there and see me waiting. The place is so dirty and I am not sure how they pass hygiene. They do not allow to order medium, only large at night. One of my order was not in the bag. When I checked the receipt, I noticed they have placed a wrong order. I told them about it, they said they don have the item and refused to give refunds when I told them I do not want the wrong order. No apology and lie about I ever placed order they put in.  Very rude and ignorant. She did not speak English but deny about putting wrong order and accused me of placing order that I would never have placed. Food was cold and bread was hard as burn. Horrible experience with them and wish McD franchiser will take their license away. It is a disgrace to the brand. The management is so bad and I find the whole experience to be unbelievable. Readck your order but best advice is, NOT to go there at all.",0
To hell with this McDonald. They closed their lobby 10,0
"No Refills!  It took about 10 minutes for me and everyone else in line to get their order done. They could only give you 3 ranch for 20 Chicken Nuggets, not even 4. Fo",0
The food was at McDonald's standards. But the upkeep of the restaurant was less than average. Garbage cans overflowing. Foot prints all over the floor and the fountain drink dispenser wasn't draining. Its had about an inch of fluid in the waste catcher. You couldn't even set your cups down to fill them up.,0
Terrible,0
People had a good sense of humor,0
Disrespectful,0
"Early morning shift had horrible service. Didn't provide a fork yet I had pancakes. Knife only.
I asked for a hot black coffee I get a foamy coffee.
I really don't believe it that's hard to take an order then have it repeated back to me at the window yet still mess up the order.
They need competent people who aren't just gossiping early morning.",0
"What happened McD? Open up!!! June 19, 2021.",0
"They charged me for a medium drink for my nieces happy meal, didn't ask for a medium drink. The guy who handed me my food barely acknowledged we were there at the window. He practically threw our food in our window while not even looking. Almost dropped our drinks. He was just shoving our food and drinks out his window blindly. I asked him why we had a medium drink he said he didn't know because it was all automatic. The cashier didn't give us our receipt so I asked him if I could get a copy of my receipt. He stormed off and comes back about a minute later shoves the receipt in my face and tells me if I want a copy of my receipt I need to ask at the first window. I just wanted to know about the medium drink otherwise I wouldn't have needed a copy of my receipt or if the cashier would have given me one I wouldn't have had to ask. Worst McDonald's I have ever been to. Never making that mistake again.",0
Terrible,0
"There is always long wait at drive through, sometimes even for 15-20 minutes",0
"associates would not help me,  they expect everyone knows hows to use the ordering kiosks.  then after ordering , associate did not know how to count change back to me, I had to do it for her.",0
disapointed ,0
"This staff does not regard the publicly posted hours, or the manager does not pay them to clean up after hours. I showed up at least 2 hours before the publicly posted closing time, and 30 minutes before the closing time verbally expressed by the cashier. Still, they only had fountain drinks, old coffee, stale mcnuggets, and ONE stale fish filet available. They had decided to clean all equipment and stop making food well before closing. Macy's is a long-respected New York institution. This lackluster and poorly run franchise is a detriment to a great store.",0
"The food there sucks, it is so tasteless & I've even got a sausage mcmuffin here & it wasn't done, plus the coke is really bad.. no coke just seltzer water... never again",0
"Too many heroin addicts taking up customer seating, not ordering food, just hanging out.",0
"Since it's on the strip, prices are more expensive for example the $1 drink is like 1.89, they are multiple McDonalds within 2 miles that have regular pricing. Some of the staff seems to not have all of it down pact, had to wait several minutes for them to correctly enter no onions no pickles on the sandwhich.",0
I am giving 1 star because you can't give a half. I will start driving another 20 min away before I come here again. IF YOU GO THROUGH DRIVE THROUGH CHECK YOU'RE ORDER EVERY TIME 10 out of the last 10 times I did order was wrong. Small fries have more fries then the large. If you order a Big Mack you will either get no mac sauce or more sauce then meat and bread. The staff is horrible drive through sucks and even if you go inside you will have to return to counter atleast 3 times before you get everything. This McDonald's has been here for ever and has been going down hill for the last year.,0
Terrible,0
"It does not serve terrible customer service through the window, you have to speak English without knowing well, they are spoiled when they deliver things to you, they throw them at you, bad service, change the ones that do not know how to serve the public or they give you the wrong order or they keep telling you what they said",0
Very slow in the evening hours,0
Poor ,0
This place is ridiculously high compared to the McDonald's just down the street. $20 for what is normally $10. On top of it didn't even ask if I wanted any sauces with my chicken McNuggets. Do yourself a favor and drive the extra couple of miles to any other McDonald's,0
I asked the one of the employees a question and he lied right to my face,0
"Very crowded, very nasty, full of homeless people begging for money.",0
"Was awful waited 30 mins for food in a half empty place, not what I'd call fast food then the big mac was luke warm ",0
Not my cup of tea.,0
Chicken nuggets we're burnt and there was no salt on my fries. Quite disappointed.,0
"Not only does this location take forever to give you the wrong food, they also give you undercooked food. We had to wait over 10 minutes for our order and this chicken sandwich was still pink.",0
They won't take my order I had to use the self serving one n they didnt take our food to the table as the number thingy said,0
Service is lousy and I tried to call number to complain to manager and no one answers/no voicemail.,0
"Manager sucks. I called her over for help and she ignored me. Seating arrangements are disorganized. The soda fountain machine is always dirty. Hardly any ice. When you press for a certain soda, it runs water for a while. Too many homeless people. The only decent thing here is the food.",0

"Drive through hours say open till midnight. Just drove through at 11:11 and even though several workers clearly seen inside, they said they were closed.",0
"I go here a couple of times a day if they are on a roll of making good tasting unsweetened ice tea. Ocassionally I get a snack. They have on their menu pricing for pies. .69 each or 2 for 1.00. When I read pies, I think it is all their pies. Nope. Their ""specialty"" pies are more and when you call them out on it they are rude and don't care. Like the customer is supposed to be able to mind read, pies means only apple pie. It was annoying to be treated so rudely over cold mcd pies. If you leadership is so unhappy maybe they should go somewhere that is a happier place. We all have choices.

There is some good leadership at this store and bad. There is no in between. Take your chances. I mainly go there for the tea....when it's good.",0
"It took about 40 minutes to get to the window to order the food.. ok... then it took another 10 or 15 to get the food. The lady was very nice, and took my order correctly... the one who served the food, is the one I have a problem  with. Ordered 2 large combos of big mac. Just to get one big mac and a fish fillet... I mean... (called to see what you can do about it, no answer) If you guys are understaffed you can hire me to do the orders CORRECTLY! Food for thought. And merry Christmas to everyone.",0
If there was zero stars thry would get it. Awful service!,0

It is written that it works 24 hours, you arrive, nothing works there, it's a lie!!!",0
Worst service in the history of human time. Waited 30 minutes for a cheeseburger. And the store was dirty!,0
"Hated my experience going inside, the cashier was flustered and kept messing up, I paid for a large drink but she hands me a medium cup, they were out of ice on both drink fountains and when the manager was told she already knew.  Then someone said we're not out, they're both broken.  So where's the sign letting the customers know?  And out of all that my fries had no salt on them, now y'all know that's the best part of your trip to Mickey Dee's, eating the hot fries... smh!!!!",0
Terrible,0

"RUN AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! We just went through the drive through and the teen girl sounded like she was depressed and going to jump.

We ordered 2 doubles, 2 chicken, 1 large fries and 2 large drinks. Everything, every-thing tasted hard like cardboard. The fries were extremely hot and hard and crunchy like stones. Both the chicken and doubles had no - no - no flavor at all and was dry as sawdust and cardboard. For the sodas one was a diet coke and other was a reg coke, both were large size which they did not get right the first time. Both sodas tasted like they were full of cinnamon flavor.

The food was over dry and tasteless. The staff at this location needs to learn how to throw away yesterday's old food..if not last weeks old junk..

It's almost a guarantee your food will taste horrible And your money wasted.. save yourself time and go somewhere else you will be glad you did!",0
"Took 15 mins to pick up my mobile order. 3 ppl working there and nobody knows where my order was. When I got it, it's already cold.",0
"tables, floors were dirty, staff was not friendly .",0
DO NOT GO!!!!!### the WORST customer service!!!! Manager does not do anything to solve a problem when drug addicts fight with customers!!!!!!! It's literally a McDonald's for the homeless.,0
"Disgusting . And they legit took forever to release my order. My mcchicken was made wrong and they had to re make it. All in all, it took about 10 minutes for 3 items of the value menu, never coming here again. ",0
It's ok need better customer service,0
"Is not possible,always long wait for the drive thru,always 1 hour to get your food,please fix the problems.",0
"Every time it never fails that you mess up, my Uber Eats order is always incomplete. The fries are always old. On an average, I spend over $30 for you to mess it up. Either you forget the sauce for the nuggets or you forget to put straws in the bag.",0
"Went there today and went through the drive thru and the girl taking my order was very rude, so I told her get the manager  and she was rude as well. Poor ass customer service if you ask me the don't even deserve my one star.",0
"at Night, they didn't give happy meal drink. they have a sign for if they don't  offer new dessert, they will give a free dessert. But they never mention about it. So, I requested them to give a free dessert. They don't want to give a free dessert..",0
they wouldn't let me order an ice cream cone and they were super rude about it!,0
Nasty food at a cheap price if you are hungry and almost broke.,0
Rude,0
The service was alful everyone working the front was either on there phone or joking around. They got my order wrong twice. New management is needed and a whole new crew to go with it.,0
Not good. Went thru drivethru and I order 4 sundaes and had to wait on the side when I saw my sundaes sitting on the counter. Those are the one they gave me half melted. I will never go there again. I threw them in the trash.,0
Super messsssssssy!!!!!!,0
This has to be the worst McDonald's I've been to. They couldn't even give me a hot sandwich,0
"The place was dirty, the staff was not overly friendly, and quite a few of McDonald's standard products were not available.",0
"One of the dirtiest McDonald's I've ever seen. Its exterior and the withdrawal window looks all dirty!!
There is no maintenance at all.!!!
If that is the building, how will the kitchen be?",0
Worst ever.   At drive through waiting for sandwiches and they moved us to next window.   Meanwhile five cars behind us have meals,0
"horrific service. this is NOT the ""world's largest McDonald's"" as people are reviewing on here, this is the location on international Dr near the OCCC. ordering at the drive thru took almost 20 minutes (this did not include waiting for the food), the man speaking kept whispering and getting an attitude despite us saying we could not hear him, did not correctly take our order, would just not say anything for multiple minutes at a time. i have never in my life been to a McDonald's with worse service. avoid at all costs",0
"The McDonald's buy the zoo... pictures say it all.   Food and drinks spilled all over the floor and tables, trash overflowing.  Don't even go in the bathrooms... yikes!!!!  There wasn't a clean table in the whole place!

Everyone was hiding in the back so nobody to take our order for almost 7 minutes.   Had I walked around and noticed the mess, we would have left.

As I'm writing this, I noticed there is a wrapper glued to my shoe.   The only nice person was the homeless lady sitting in the corner.

Don't eat here unless you want to get Ebola",0
"Horrible service, staff was very rude and we waited over 20 minutes for our order. When we asked why it was taking so long the lady said ""well you can wait for the food or you can just leave now""",0

"Breafast burritos tortillas are always hard and eggs are dried out when I go late in the morning.  So I ask for extra cheese. Cashier says they cannot do that because they are already made. I tell her make me 2 fresh ones. She says she has to ""go see""  Comes back and says no.  I order something elsr and aak for fries. It is only 10:15 and we cant make fries until 10:30.  I can get hash browns at 3:00 pm but cant get fries until after 10:30?? Makes no sense. I ask for manager. She says ""I am the manager""  Really? Then why did you have to go ask about the cheese?  Do you always ASK your emoyees if tthey can put cheese on sonething?  So now she not only gives bad service...but LIES to me about being manager!  I want call from OWNER",0
"My order is WRONG every time; the most frustrating customer experience. I live near this new location and have visited 6 times since the remodel, and I've concluded that this location is a 120% mess. If all of my orders are wrong I can imagine thousands of others are driving off with incorrect purchases. I ask for no cheese every time, and guess what is in my order.. CHEESE. Or my frys are half full, or the hashbrowns are completely missing, no syrup/ utensils are in the bag as requested. On 3 occasions we were told to pull ahead and park on the side while they remake my order, an employee brings out an incorrect order.. yes 3 times. Today this ""New"" team member blatantly tells me to go in and take of it... what the hell? Every other time I let the incorrect order slide, but today I decided to speak with the store manager. I let her know politely about all of my incorrect orders, and she replies ""Sorry"", I then ask ""what is mcdonalds doing about this, its every time the order is wrong?"" She responds ""I'm so sorry""... I ask again and same response.  Meanwhile the woman next to me is asking about the replacement order that she put in ten minutes ago, they apologize to her and say they are going to reinput it.... this new location is a joke, its truly insane that a Mcdonalds is operating like this, and its been a few months since their brand new building opened.",0
"Horrible experience. Good location, however the structure is terrible and disorganized. I waited almost 40 minutes for my order to be ready. The staff are nice, however the whole service is a mess.",0
Check your bill after order we've got 'extras' for 2$ we didnt order and while we were waiting they did same for other customer. And btw restrooms are disaster.,0
"Although the food was fresh and I received plenty of ketchup, Their soda fountain beverages were expired. Every single one of them.",0
"Seriously, what is the deal with not being able to brew fresh sweet tea? It's sad that you have to check your drinks before you leave the drive thru. It seems as if 3 time a week we get bad tea from this location. It's not like we can just leave work to go get a new one either. We send my hubby on a drink run in the morning and he constantly forgets to take the ""taste test"" before he leaves, but he should not have to!",0
"Literally waited 20 minutes. The sign says to ""place tent on table and relax. Your delicious food is on its way"" but it wasn't even delivered to us.",0
Poor ,0
"Not open 24 hours, they need to change their hours online.",0
"They messed my order up 2 times. They remade my sandwich and the chicken was still raw. They have nasty attitudes. You have to use the kiosk to place your order. There is no more service with a smile. An update I now have food poisoning form the raw/ undercooked chicken I was served yesterday. Don't eat here, I will never come back here ever again. My reviews have been see by over 100,500 people.",0
"Horrible! Got home ordered a crispy chicken sandwich. They gave it to me on a plain dry bun, with nothing on it. Just chicken & bread.",0
"I can honestly say this is the world's worst McDonald's I have so far experienced. A 45-minute wait for a very simple and straightforward order. I've eaten in McDonald's all over the world, and the food quality and service let this one down severely. So many people were angry with ridiculous waiting times, wrong orders, crushed food, and items not available. I do not recommend it!",0
They never have anything - Their Menu is always crossed out and when you order something,0
They can't handle a lot of customer. Waited 10 minutes for my order outside,0
"Take 13 minutes to get a single order,one of the worst ever",0
It doesn't matter how many nuggets you get you have to fight for the sauce. It's so annoying!,0
"We went through the drive thru and to start it took too long for anyone to come over the speaker and then they were quiet and hard to understand. One of the things we ordered was ""a number two"". He was asked what size he wanted and what to drink as part of the order. They didn't give us fries with our combo meal and when the manager FINALLY noticed me he gave us a medium fry not the large we ordered.",0
I wanted to give it zero stars waited over 15 minutes for curbside pick  up  for my order which was 1 sandwich with my sleepy toddler in the car I walked in thought to see if they had it ready and maybe  didn have enough people to bring out because that always the issue at this location but as I walked in bunch of people high-fiving and talking asked for my order and instead of looking for it they wanted me to reorder it some how 1 sandwich got  lost and I am the only one waiting on the curbside  pick up ....  this is very disgusting behavior I unde,0

Worst coffee latte in my life?Please just stop it take it out of menu it is worst. My cup ended up in a trash aft,0
"No cashiers/order takers; you must use their self-service kiosk which they have several of. You take a number sign to your table and staff will deliver your order to your table; however, this wasn't the case for us. The employee came from around the counter and yelled our number while she stood in the nearly empty lobby. We were seated less than 6 feet away from her and in her line-of-sight. We raised our hand and said, ""that's us"". She saw us, but made no attempt to deliver the food. I don't mind getting up and getting the food from her despite the kiosk saying it would be delivered to our table, but, I'm feeling a little like an unpaid employee at this point...we placed the order ourselves as well as served ourselves the food despite paying the same amount for the food that a full-service McDonald's charges. Several people in-store and in drive thru returned food due to being cold, old or not made correctly. This included us...at 1:00 in the afternoon the nuggets were cold, chewy and seemed old. I would think this wouldn't be the case given 1:00 p.m. is during the lunch rush. Fries were cold presumably because they were sitting on the tray well before the rest of the food was ready. Double cheeseburger was made correctly (no mustard or pickles), but bun was not warm/dry and cheese was cold/not melted. 4 managers were in the kitchen (button-up shirts with ties) along with 6 employees yet there was a lot of standing around doing nothing and operating with a shuffle-paced, leisurely-stroll walk. I worked at McDonald's and Burger King as a teenager and was always told, ""If you got time to lean, you've got time to clean"", and that was during slow/dead times, not lunch rush. I will say that the manager I returned my double cheeseburger and fries to (we ended up just eating our stale nuggets because we were told it was going to be 5-10 minutes for fresh ones) was nice and when I told her she could just microwave my burger she insisted on making a new one.",0
It's unacceptable to have to wait in the drive-thru for 40 minutes just to order food,0
"They did not give me my complete order, I made 3 order  of chicken deluxe and my order was missing fries whet back to made a complain and they were yelling at me and husband, this is not fear to the customer. People should be aware  of this  Mcdonald at Broadway and check their food properly before they leave drive thru. Those staff there are thief.",0

"Cashier had her hair in a ponytail and so did all the other workers (that's not allowed , servsafe states you can only have you're hair in a braid or bun when working with food) one of the cooks had on of the sides her shirt in a knot exposing her lower right stomach. I asked the manager and he said the cashier had her hair down in a pony tail because she was almost leaving and the chick with the shirt up was because he shirt got in the way of her cleaning. OH! BTW she was cooking and sweeping with out washing hands !.",0
"horrible horrible horrible manager at night. unfortunatly i didnt catch her name but shes the oldest one in the night shift atleast on most days when i come. today is 5/9/2022, and its 12:10am, and all i did was ask her if my order was still there cuz on my screen it disappeared and she just kept saying, U GOTTA KEEP WAITING, so i said, i dont mind waiting i just want to know if my order is on ur side cuz it disappeared on my side and she rolled her eyes and said, LIKE I SAID YOU HAVE TO KEEP WAITING!!!!! and its not the first time this happens. i was here one day when she yelled at a customer saying, I TOLD YOU UR APPLE PIES ARENT READY YET!!! that someone else went up to her and told her she needs to calm herself down. so disrespectful and rude and she should not be working anywhere where it involves guests cuz obviously she has no patience. you can ask her for some ketchup and she rolls her eyes right ahead!",0

These was the 2nd time I had this problem with the same McDonald's. I was hoping that the first time just some kind of mistake. So I fell for it twice.  And at the redickuless price they get like $4 for like 1/4 of a potato. 10 lb for that price in the store.  It will not be happening again! No more fries from this place!!! And all over 1 cents worth of salt. Lmao,0

Kinda scary the way it just lingered in the parking lot without a worry in the world.

It either you don't get everything or you get everything and something is physically wrong with the food. Today I did a mobile order for pickup.

This location should have stayed closed. Why do they have a re-opening sign when they're only operating for drive thru. What about the pedestrians? The ones who can't drive? At least I was able to walk in and  order food before they remodeled. I live less than a mile from here and I can't walk over and physically order food? And why is there a parking lot if we can't walk in. And how rude the associate was that I basically should have known better that they were only running the drive thru? You're better off going to the one on burbank Blvd. Who puts a double lane on a drive thru and doesn't expect problems? This isn't it McDonald's... 20 minutes sitting in a drive thru...,0

"There is a hired male guard for the bathrooms to ensure only paying customers use it, which seems overkill and made me as a customer uncomfortable. The technology of coded locks satisfy this need for other businesses in the area. Bigger concern is that a guarded bathroom was still incredibly filthy.

Worst McDonald's every they never get an order correct they never give ice in their drinks and serve warm soda! Takes forever to get the order then it is not correct! The phone number is out of service so you can't even call to complain! WORST MCDONALDS EVER!!!!,0
Just bad service wasn't busy but the food took 15-20 mins,0
Lines outrageously long with not enough help,0
Obviously not enough  staff working.  Ice machine was broke.  We had to go up to counter and ask for a couple things missing from our order.  Things were a mess.,0
"The night shift crew and their unknown secret supervisor, a white Hispanic lady will refuse completing ubereats orders at times. They will lie to the customer that the Ubereats delivery person has cancel the order and they will lie on the other end to the ubereats delivery person that the customer has cancel the order.
They will also refuse to answer the phone calls from ubereats support.
Finally, they will give the ubereats driver a bad rating of unprofessionalism for not canceling the order.",0
Ok.,0
"Understaffed, constantly inaccurate orders. Fries are almost always cold . Attitude given when corrections are brought to their attention. Dirty bathrooms .....",0
Went with wife and daughter. Ordered 2 McDonald's and a kids meal. Took 35 mins to get food. Everyone was waiting that long and room wasn't even busy. Workers were just standing around in back bullshytting. Lady called out my number and was very rude as she just dropped bag on table..... will not be back... if you hate your job QUIT!!!,0
Long waiting time at nights I waited for an hour for drive thru,0
Beware they are not 24 hours. I've stopped here several time in the early am hours and the door was locked. The workers were inside and wouldn't even come to the door. They yelled 6 oclock. So much for 24 hours. When it is open it surrounded by homeless people inside and out. They might as well turn it into a homeless shelter.,0
Very very slow but the food was good,0
Poor ,0
Get the lady out the push out window early serving nasty attitude and wrong orders early in the morning,0
"My quarter pounder with cheese was old, cold and dry.",0
Unorganized. Plenty of staff but it still took 30 minutes to get our incomplete order,0
Terrible,0
"VERY, VERY BAD SERVICE ON DRIVE THRU.",0
Worst MC ever.,0
some homeless was there semi clean although great customer service,0
Poor ,0
"Good morning, Please tell me if this matters or if I'm being to sensitive or petty or overly concerned. Maybe because I didn't have my coffee this morning.

I patronize this McDonalds in Oak Park every morning. This morning I forgot my wallet. I asked the Supervisor if I could pay them the less than $5.00 breakfast tomorrow. They said so sorry No. I pleaded with this new manager that I'd never seen before. I asked for the manager that I'd spoken with on several occasions.
She refused to see me, and he stated that her response would be the same!!! I asked him what was to happen to food on the counter in front of us. He said it would be discarded!!!!

Seriously, I asked. So, I said that you'd rather throw it away then let me have it, a faithful customer.....So my lesson is now, Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson. McDonalds doesn't care about my patronizing their establishment and I'm going to seriously break my coffee habit. No more McDonalds from Oak Park on Madison for me.
A lesson well learned, can you believe my feeling was hurt when he said that my breakfast was to be discarded.",0
Ok long wait.,0
"Burger patties were served to us rare through the drive through. Both mine and my husband. I broke mine in half to show the picture.

Didn find out until we got home, unable to go back out now. I tried calling just to let them know this issue may be reoccurring throughout the night but nobody answered the phone. I",0
"After order 15 minutes at midnight, no body show up at the payment window, I just left.",0
"Very poor security at this location. It's impossible to go in without being harassed by people asking for money, and the staff don't even try to ask them to leave.",0
"Poor attitude, slow service.",0
"They've gotten my order incorrect three times. I normally order the same thing all the time: two steak and cheese bagels and a mango smoothie. One time they gave me two sausage bagels. The next time they gave me two sausage bagels with egg and cheese. The third time they gave me two steak and cheese bagels with egg. When I tried to call the number on the receipt, it goes to some corporate number who never returned my call.",0
Terrible. Just terrible,0
Worst McDonald's I've ever been to. Only half the menu items available (in large only). Terrible service. Rude staff  Got my order wrong and they gave me a hard time when I went to get the correct order,0
Several times I have been 30 min waiting in the drive thru.,0
Poor ,0
"AVOID. They will mock you (not in English), laugh amongst themselves, and rudely serve you.",0
Terrible,0
Service wasn't the best and my food was cold,0
"Staff was great, but cook are trash...
How can you screw up a simple burger? when you don't care that's how...",0
They need better training on how the app works if the payment doesn go thru it tells you payment failed it would not give you a code to pick up food if it not paid for  tonight crew  the so called manager 11:40pm 12/08 do better if a 30% coupon was applied and the payment came out and the app generates a code why would we have to pay you $5more dollars that would make us pay full price 30% off is the $5 슬 shows it out of my account they tell me it didn go thru so I have to pay again at the store no way how does that even make sense cancel order once again food an time wasted get new employees who know what they are doing it always the,0
Their service is slow the food sucks and you better always check your kids meals because they always forget something,0
Very friendly kinda slow always,0
Their sprit soda tastes just as faucet water.,0
This place is total kaos!! The worst service anywhere.Yes  the worst!,0
Horrible place bad service. I ordered at 3:40am didn't get my order until 4:13 I was missing half my order and when I told them they had the nerve to say they will replace it for breakfast items because they no longer serve lunch. It's not my fault they can't do their job correct and get orders right!,0
Don't come to this mc Donald's. They always takes forever to prepare your food and constantly passes people in front of you,0
One minute after closing. 1:01AM... Sorry bro I already turned off all the machines. COVID=NO MORE CUSTOMER SERVICE,0
This place has horrible accuracy and dont care to answer the phone EVER.,0
"Dirty inside atmosphere,  food luke warm and food over cooked.",0
Not a fan of McDonald's.  This one was not real clean,0
Went through the drive through and failed to check my order before getting on the road. Twice before I have been given the wrong order. How do they do that? Third time's a charm. I am pledging not to go to McD's again.,0
"I ordered a latte from the Miami Beach Lincoln road branch and waited for my drink. I saw my number flash up on the screen but no one called me. I went up and asked the woman (short reddish hair) who was calling out the order numbers if my number had been called. The answer was no. I kept waiting and still nothing. I asked her again but I was rudely ignored due to her having a chat with her friend. I asked several different people working there about my latte but they all said it's coming and moved on. The staff were either rude, indifferent and just no longer interested in me after I had paid. People came and went with their orders and I was left waiting for my one latte. I said to one woman how long does it take to make a latte? She looked at my ticket and of course no one had even started making it. I was disgusted with the truly terrible customer service. If u want good service do not go to this mcdonalds.",0
"I had to ask for every single little thing.  Ie: napkins,  catsup,  spoons for the sundays,  peanuts,  extra peanuts. My receipt. Clearly she didn't want to be at work.  SMH. 0 RATING.",0
"Waited in line for 30+ mins to get to order and they said that everything was broken and were taking cash only. Nice. I wasn't even mad, just disappointed.",0
Y폸ll are freaking slow I swear it like y폸ll heads are up your ass while at work if u don like you job quit I just went they drive thru and the girl at window seemed to have a,0
It took over an hour to go Thur the drive thru and the order was wrong,0
I sat in the drive thru for 20 minutes just now because the manager on shift at the window was on their phone the whole time while they were severely understaffed.,0
There ice cream macine was obviously broken again,0
"Cashier couldn't understand me and when asking about an item they had on the board, she said they didn't have that. No please, no thank you. Order was not quite right, as it often isn't. Nobody follows instructions. Please retrain staff.",0
Better and cleaner than I thought it would be.,0
Ordered the curbside orders but waited around 20 mins since the staff totally forgot to take the meals out??? I ordered regular iced latte but got suuuuper sweet latte instead. Even got the overcooked bun on my muffin! Worst experience!,0
Only thing good is the fries....and please bring the orange hi-c back!!!,0
Bad,0
"Third time this year that the drive thru got my order wrong, and I've only been four times!  And the manager expected me to get back in my car, drive back to the restaurant and wait in line again to get it fixed- I don't think so!",0
nothing,0
"This is the worst McDonald's I've ever been to. I've tried it several times, mostly because it's on the way to my work...but after today, honestly, I'd rather skip breakfast all together. I got a completely soggy hash brown, soggy all the way around. I got a small caramel frappe with a shot of espresso. They put the espresso on the bottom and just poured the Frappe on top, so all I got was espresso when I first tried it. To add insult to injury, they put it in a small cup and dumped the rest out (it should have been in a medium cup). I worked at a McDonald's for over 2 years and this one does not follow procedures at all",0
Don't go there. There's a European guy who's very mean to customers and he's the worst human being I've ever met.,0
They  made right however about 30 minutes  I was hunger  again,0
Really long SLOW line at the drive through. Took FOREVER.,0
The Security gaurd was rude and dismissive and for the second time now the man at the pick up window completley ignored us even though OUR food was ready and gave ( tried to give us the wrong order.),0
When you want one of the main items on the list and they don't have it... sock juice is better than the service in this location.  How are these people even allowed to work here? Plants are nicer. I have been to McDonald's in 54 different countries and CONGRATULATIONS you are the WORST!,0
There was no one men the drive through i came back three times. I love McDonald's I have been going there since i was very young. I hope things change for the better at this location.,0
"Thank you for the cold breakfast. Made me wait almost 40 minutes. Families got theirs before my lil sandwich and coffee. They just forgot about my meal and let it sit. Only thing warm was the coffee,barely.
Not anyone",0
Its ok  could be better i say its just to many homeless people dine un n have a bad smell  of sweat  n people get high in bathroom  n leave needle n bags of drugs on floor dirty at time smell homeless people  askin for money harass people who eat in McDonalds,0
I went to use the bathroom while I was there and it was utterly nasty. What else would you expect from McDonald's,0
"same as all the other reviews, slow, only 6 items on the menu, employees are on their phones more than their helping customers in front of them. Employee's also trash talk customers in front of other customers... Wasn't even worth the head ache of receiving sub-par food for.",0
"Drive thru was open at 11:00 pm, but didn't get served. Voice on speaker rudely said ""we're closed"". Lots of cars weren't served.",0
They messed up my order. And they are slow. And alot of loud mouth drug addicts was in there making noise,0
Mc Don't go here,0
My Nuggets Came Back Covered In Mustard When I Said I wanted mayonais the manaigs they tried giving me was disguting when i ate it and trhen the mustard got on my arm,0
Terrible,0
Worst MacDonald I've ever been to I hope I never go back it's all bad,0
Got food poisoning from breakfast. Rude service inside the dining room.,0
We wait in the line for over 20 min. When we arrive 2 employees were outside the store speaking. The worst drive thru service ever!,0
A night to purchase your food,0
"Absolutely horrid customer service; and even though I have lower expectations for a McDonald's in food quality, this has particularly bare food taste and is often served sloppily. Eye contact is optional in their employee training, apparently.",0
I wanted to get a McFlurry. Unfortunately it was out of stock.,0
"The white guy at the drive thru was good and friendly.  The reception was right.. But when I got my order, it was wrong.  I went inside to get corrected. The cashier and manager had some sort of rival  gang problem. Instead of walking away from the problems. They all started fighting. It was horrible. I won't ever go back there.",0
If it's busy you will wait ages. Poor food at high prices. Plenty of better places to eat nearby,0
I personally don't like fast food but McDonald's is a mainstay. NYC has much more to offer than that as a food choice.,0
disapointed ,0
So dirty,0
There is a security guard/cop standing around and he makes me feel unsafe for some reason. A black bum was harrassing me and tell cop looked on. It's not walker friendly as there is a gate around the outside. At least it was clean on the inside.,0
"As an uber driver and delivery person today 29 10 2017 I received a delivery from that place for a client. I stay . At zero battery, but I take a current charger that I had in the car. I went to McDonald's I asked them to let me connect in the corridor to complete my order and they told me no. It couldn't end, I lost time and money, and I'm sorry for the customer and my uber company.",0
"Waited 40 minutes in the drive thru, and then they started turning cars away. Would've loved to go somewhere else, but the options were sparse at 1 AM. Got up to the window and the manager literally didnt even care about the horrible service.",0
this is my second time going through drive thru in the same person gave me my food with an attitude if u do not like your job dont work. on 3-29-2019 07:30pm,0
"I am very dissatisfied with the service at this location. I asked for a #1 which is a big Mac instead they charged me for a quarter pounder. My son ordered a cheeseburger happy meal , he wanted the burger with mustard, onions, and pickles. My son was so upset and he refused to eat his food . The burger that I got slopply made and the meat was half way hanging out of the burger and it was so bad that it was almost dry. My little boy was so upset that he doesn't want to here any more. From a very mad Mommy and a hurt little boy",0
Sweet tea was bad not sweet at all and had a moldy tast to it.,0
This McD's location has NO sit down dinning available. I requested extra pickles and still got only 1 pickle per cheese burger. Lame.,0
Yuck,0
This location is NOT open 24 hours! Please adjust your google advertisement!,0
"Not too customer friendly, a definite language barrier.
Ordered @ 10:35 right when the lunch menu starts and the fries were mildly warm definitely not fresh.",0
"Terrible service, I think hands down worst mcdonalds I have ever been too. Manager wouldn't even come over to help. Absolute joke of a mcdonalds. Go 1 mile down either way and you will be much happier.",0
"They won't mess up your order, but you will sit in the drive through for at least 15 - 20 minutes before you get to order and then wait another 10 minutes to get your food. Overall unless it's your only option, you should drive on to a better run McDonalds.",0
"Went here a few days ago around 10pm to get some food. Guess what the person at the drive-thru told me?

""I'm sorry but we're out of burgers""

We truly are in endtimes folks. Brace yourselves.",0
The breakfast sandwich was burnt and also hard as a rock. Broke my tooth..,0
Only drive thru open.,0
Standard food. Fast service. Cash only at night. More expensive than other McDs.,0
"No soap, no towel, dirty floors, friendly service.",0
"Just horribly slow! Waited 10 minutes to get to the order screen at the drive thru, even though only two cars ahead of us in the right lane. It took another 40 minutes to get my kid's food. It really makes no sense",0
Terrible,0
They take too long and they퐎e super rude and rush me all the time. when it time to pay she rushes me to put my card in knowing that the car in front of me hasn,0
"Dinning room was closed at 11 PM. Hours on the door say 5 AM to 3 AM. There were many employees inside, but they only served drive-thru and refused to open dinning room.",0
"Slow, lazy staff. At 6am there is hardly any business, yet waited for a breakfast for 15min",0
Very bad service I asked for a medium hot chocolate without cream they gave me a quarter glass of chocolate and I told them and they filled it with water it no longer tasted like chocolate and the lady got upset why did I tell her that the glass was not even half full,0
Service isn't that good,0
I walked in the door with my son in-law to order inside because it said dining room open till 3am.  It was 1am 3-22-2022.  We went to every kiosk none working.  We walked up to register.  A woman back towards the back yelled out that they were closed.   Well we walked out got in our van pulled up to drive through.    Nobody responded.  We turned off engine a waited a bit.  Nobody.  We left and visited Wendy's drive thru.,0
"Says 24 hour drive through. They're always closed, shut down, doing maintenance, only cash, systems are down, or some other reasons why they can't serve the early risers. They shouldn't post on the signa that the drive through is open just to not serve anyone or have it on maps that they are open just to refuse customers.",0
Sucked,0
Zero hygiene,0
 staff was rude and dismissive,0
I ordered a Big Mac and both meat patties were razor thin it was like eating bread with lettuce the lettuce was thicker than the freaking meat patties,0
Super slow...,0
The slowest McDonald's anywhere.,0
The worst McDonald I,0
"No one answered drive thru, the employees were on their phones....",0
"Beware this location.
I am a huge user of Mcdonald Happy Meal for my child so I know how to use a Mcdonald app order but this location is not working at all. Furthermore, the kiosk order system just takes the money from the credit card.(receipt paper was run out) even the person register took my order twice for one happy meal.
I paid 4 times for one happy meal. I understand this place is overcrowded in the Macy's department but they can work better. I won't go back to this location ever. Worst place ever.",0
A lot of homeless people,0
They didn't have ice at 2:30am this might so the drink was hot and tasted funny,0
"This McDonalds is pretty hit or miss, mostly miss. I placed an online mobile order, showed up 5 minutes later, and the lady kept me waiting for minutes until she told me they didnt have my order. Didnt even try to accommodate me any other way, she simply just turned me away. Was pretty rude also. They apparently couldn't be bothered to service a PAYING customer.",0
"Good was good, but took 7 minutes to get me an iced coffee.",0
"Really slow service, took over 15 minutes to receive the food,  after it had been delivered to another table.

When it did arrive, the chicken and burger were cold. Duly sent back, to be fair they were remade and brought pretty quick, but no apology.",0
Person was very rude gave me the wrong order and the food was cold check the food back and got my money back,0
It would be nice place if you could enjoy your meal without people asking for money the whole time,0
My pattie was undercooked after waiting 15 min in the drive thru your employees are in there playing games an playing with people's food don't go here,0
"I don't know what to say Ronald, your car just went over the cliff. Food was terrible.",0
disapointed ,0
"Still waiting... 25 minutes if you are looking for FAST food, think about other place",0
Closed early and drive thru takes forever,0
"It took 1 plus hours to get thru the drive thru.  The drive thru is such that once in line you cannot get out. No one apologised for the abnormal wait time. When I got my food, the fries where cold and the taste old. I usually to not complain about a restaurant but 1 plus hours in a drive thru line is ludicrous. Especially for a fast food establishment.",0
Homeless people ruin the air...seriously you guys need to do something,0
Really bad service the hash browns tast if they were just sitting there and I asked for a second bag and they gave to me with an attitude,0
"Our order was messed two days in a row when visiting this McD on vacation.

The first day they rang up our at the drive thru incorrectly AND didn even match the incorrectly charged order. Second day we ordered at the kiosk inside and they didn give us 2 of the items we ordered (an apple pie and hashbrown).

Not sure if there",0
"Update: updating to 1 stars. Was at the drive through for over 20 mins today. Cars were leaving the line bc it wasn moving. Got on the 2 lane and no one came to the speaker. I left.

Customer Service is terrible. Starting from when you get to the ordering screen. Drive-thru employees never greet you, never thank you, they look  tired and moody. There is one or two exceptions, I did look at the name badge because I was surpri",0
The worker could not get my order on time and had an attitude,0
It sucked,0
They will NOT TAKE YOUR ORDER inside UNLESS you use their self serve kiosk. I shouldnt have to say I cannot see the screen for someone to take an order. Why have the front counter if its self checkout at ALL times. It is not busy. I just left and went to get food from someone else. Why is that the only way to order. I work and live near here but will definitely not be back nor my coworkers.,0
"Why would you have someone work the cash register and take orders who doesn't speak or understand English, especially at lunch time?",0
"Large capuchino???? The second picture with the flash light was other day, take your own review about it, IT IS A ",0
"Extremely slow service, one cashier with multiple people working slowly in the back, a line up to and out the door, and the drive through wrapped around the building. Avoid late at night.",0
"Its mcdonalds, just went because u was short on time",0
"羲?hat羲? how you know you are in a bad part of town羲?- Me
羲?e specially asked for 3 large waters and got kids cups..羲?- Shane
羲? homeless people way too close to my car羲?- Griffin",0
They don't have combo items.  this place is so busy.,0
Food was so bad ,0
"I work five minutes away from this store, so I go there all the time. Everytime I go there's a problem. This time my bun was so hard. The bottom bun. There's always something wrong. I worked for this same company for a lot of years,(swing manager). It's crazy. I've only got good service once or twice there.",0
"I was there to separate times one time I paid over $2 more than the second
time and got the exact same thing",0
"This place was a mess. They took FOREVER to serve the few people they had. A guy dropped a spatula. I was freaking out. They would take counter order cause the manager said ""When we are done in the back."" So upset with this service.",0
"Service was horrible. I will never go to that location again. Madison near Cicero.
Took 30 mins to get a hot tea. Worke4 had an attitude . I kept being nice i didn't  What her to spit in my water. It was ridiculous I will never go to that location again",0
Poor ,0
Sucks. Consistently makes hard/overcooked/dry food. Fries are never salted. Tea is whack asf,0
My sweet tea was sour.,0
Terrible I thought they had great food at one point however I'm thinking that Burger King is going to be better for me from now on....the simple fact I went yesterday at 3:00 in the morning to go get a burger and they gave it to me ice cold then I had to wait on the line like about six cars in front of me in order for them to get the sandwich right then they put very little bit of lettuce which I asked for extra lettuce I don't care if I have to pay for it I just want my extra lettuce and no pickle on the double McDouble anyways I don't know but I might eat them but not as much as I was eating them before and as for their fries well they were good,0
"The chicken nuggets were overly greasy and seemed like they were reheated, and the staff lacked basic customer service skills.",0
I dried going to this place. This place messes up more times than getting it right. Bad MD.,0
Very nice staff but took 20 mins to get egg McMuffin. Not worth it if you're in a rush,0
"They smokin d, I bought burgers or whatever, and they put one or two tiny lil lettuce pieces in them , it",0
A very bad experience every time I visited this place the staff is very arrogant they have no customer friendliness it seems that they also have a lot of racism towards Hispanics what a pity they put such a reputable place in hand for many years all the staff are very unpleasant they make you wait too long and when they serve you they have a bad attitude ... I really do not recommend it to anyone,0
"Night employees are stealing from customers, and probably the restaurant as well.
They short changed me twice on the same order, and claimed the receipt machine was ""not working"" when i asked for the receipt.",0
Slow service and rude,0
Terrible,0
Very slow,0
"Rude cashiers, waited for lmost 40mns in drive thru why do they make 2 lanes waste of time",0
"Lady at the drive thru made a mistake and we talked to her we we're courteous, and she mad dogged and had an attitude.",0
I am most certainly not lovin it.,0
Hash browns are always cold and under-cooked.,0
"Prices are way too high, got pulled forward only to wait an extra 20 minutes. Still no food. Went inside to ask for a refund. Food still wasn't ready. Ask what the hell was going on and the cow behind the counter said ""oh our bun toaster is broken"".  Didn't say that at the window!! This is an I DRIVE location. Absolutely ridiculous. Stay away. What a waste.",0
Got my order wrong. Bye bye,0
Poor ,0
"Very rude manager , waited 40 minutes for our meal to have it handed by the manager practically shoving it at me , and saying here .",0
The building looked good and It had a lot of stuff but the employees didn't even know the food or how it was supposed to be made when they gave us the food we were missing have of the food they gave us a chicken sandwich with no chicken instead they had put a beef patty in it and one of the drinks was messed up in the second floor the air conditioning didn't work it was so hot in there plus employees were just standing there not doing nothing and just ignoring the mess that was there it had poor service I do not recommend very clogged and slow service too,0
The manager Cassandra is very rude to customers and very unprofessional they did not acknowledge people standing at the register and then I asked if they were taking orders they reply with that's why the kiosks are there two customers walked. I work for Uber Eats as a driver picking up food and then I experience very unpleasant,0
Very slow and poorly run store. Has potential to be a great location with great profits. But the management is horrid and help is not helpful and pretty much hasn't clue on what is going on. Ordering takes for ever and food even longer.,0
Super slow.,0
"Same as any other Mc Donald's in the world, a lot of the homeless comunity visits there so it's good to always give them a hand",0
Poor ,0
They make me wait a long time to get my order,0
Terrible,0
I went there two times with bad experiences. Both time the automatic cashier was out of paper. You are calling assistance to have your number of order and they don care. They serve your coffee black even of you asked to add cream in the order. Looks,0
Filthy and smelly place,0
They was loud and had attudes and hanging all out the window my food was cold this was a bad place to eat at,0
"Lst night the cashier wouldnt assist in exchanging a nugget meal for a nugget happy meal due to their broken kiosk misplaced the order. Neither would sell the toy itself to help a child get their wanted toy instead sold a seperate happy meal box! Coffe was cold too!

Next day went bck hoping to get a different experience... the guy on the floor was really nice and polite but the middle eastern cashiers.... not so much!!!! Im standing their waiting to be assisted but instead the latina looking and the middle eastern had a more important conversation of how to remove her nose piercing and how to clean it! Also she was manipulating her nose while at the csshier! So so disgusting!!! Grosss!!!!!",0
the service was horrible I was very very disappointed they don't give you the right food that don't take that order correctly then-manager I don't know why they do on their time because you ask for manager and takes forever to come and assist you I will never go there again,0
They moved fast but it wasnt very crowded. The food wasnt that good it was no salt on the fries and my burger was extrs salty. Then they gave me orange soda because they didnt have strawberry fanta but thats def not what i wanted. If im ever in the area i wont be coming back here.,0
Service is very poor. Always have something wrong with my order. Zero stars,0
"Order are never ready , dinnin always close for some reason",0
Ive been in line for 30 minutes. No one wants to work.,0
Horrible service. New updated look and same terrible employees. Avoid this place.,0
The beef in the hamburger is very small.,0
"I came today at this store at 9pm and the person in charge scream from a table to us. That it was closed (a lady with red curly hair) i  didnt said anything to her and when to the computer because people was ordering, when she came to us; she said again it was closed, i told her it said outside and in the page that this store close at 11pm. She said in a rude way: if you order your food will not be prepared. And she closed the computer. I didnt said anything to that woman, because im not wasting my time and energy with  people as rude like that. I퐉  writing this review because this is the closer store to my house, and is really sad that a company as your have this unprofessional & rude employees and is not the first time i have a bad cx service experience in this store, but today was to far. I dont think this are the values or your company, but, this is what your ",0
They must have been busy before we got there cause the store looked nasty,0
"It's Mcdonald's, go to In and Out burger or P. Terry's or the million of other better burger places here in Austin or anywhere.",0
People are usually drunk here and the service people really dont like their jobs.,0
"The manager is rude and speaks to her employees in spanish to insult customers,  Security guard was creepy",0
Very bad service. Staff discriminate homeless even if they are paying for the food. It time to realize that people should ,0
Poor ,0
"Terrible service with drive thru ,check your bag/bags before heading out to I87",0
We have been trapped in line for almost 30 minutes now and are still waiting on our food! Beware!,0
you do not get the whole change and its very dirty in there,0
Nasty service,0
It was so dirty that we have to clean a table to be able to sit.,0
Waited 20 min for a qtr pounder at 3am only to witness a worker scrape the onions off my burger with her bare hands I asked for a new burger she argued that I didn't see her do this  absolutely unacceptable,0
slowest mcdonalds I've been. Waited for 30 min. Think they are short in staff or either the staff is sleeping,0
This place is super slow at the drive thru i was in that line for 50 min to get a simple happy meal for my kid this is not part of a fast food restaurant with that kind of time,0
"Real bad,  bad service . Do not recomnend it at all",0
"!! Fraud location !! !!!Fraud location !!!, the manager told us they have different policy for this location they don't work any more with the corporate , I am really worried about What's This now , they said they only respect the online ordering coupons if ur ordering at drive thru ( in photo ) the manager given us , health department must check this location carefully bcoz something is fishy here .. or Macdonald corporate MUST HAVE A CHECK On them URGENTLY, avoid it",0
I can't even give them a star.  We had to order 4 times after sitting in line for over 45 mins- they still got it wrong.  Their team needs training severely.  We ended up working with the manager and he did give us the food free- spouse and teenage found it inedible.,0
"Totally blew my order which was not only wrong, but cold as well.",0
Slow service. Been waiting in my car.. parked.. for 30 minutes,0
the gandons that the salafan put on the ice,0
Order two large fries both was burnt !! Not the frist time !! They will give nasty food when going threw the drive threw !!!,0
Loud obxious mgrs screaming out orders,0
"Says 24/7. Mobile app allows for drive through order. Lights are all on and drive through speaker is active. But nobody is working. Location is closed, no sign, no disabling online orders, nothing.",0
Legit the worst McDonald's ever .have the app can't ever finish my purchase day or night cause guess what they aren't taking app orders .. then Everytime I go it's cash only who the hell carries cash anymore ..this is my Fourth attempt I ma over it the only reason I am even going cause it's open late,0
The ice cream is fine... Not much else..,0
Unnecessary long wait time in drive thru. Drive thru is built for double cars and double pick up windows but still stayed behind 4 cars for 30 minutes. Only waited due to long drive home with kids in the car. Rude staff as well. Really wish I had noticed the Burger King across the street earlier. I would have even settled for checkers across the street and that's saying a lot because I don't think anyone willingly eats at checkers,0
Poor ,0
DO NOT GO!!!!!### the WORST customer service!!!! Manager does not do anything to solve a problem when drug addicts fight with customers!!!!!!! It's literally a McDonald's for the homeless.,0
"Horrible location. Frequently makes mistakes with larger orders. Almost every time we come here with larger orders there are missing items. Rude employee as well. One time refused to give me receipt at drive thru.
Was there yesterday also, and the employee at the drive thru window did not wear mask properly. Only half the mouth was covered and the nose was not covered at all. Note that this McDonald's is located in one of the NYC Covid hotspots.",0
"I ordered takeout from the McDonald's app. After waiting at least 20 minutes they finally talked to me and asked about my order. I said that I put my order in through the app. They said that because their system was down they could not give me the food that I paid for. I spent ten dollars and wasted a half hour of my life. I have had to complain to corporate, I have had to talk to a manager via email. Nothing has been done, they don't even want to give me a refund they merely offered me a coupon which they never gave me. It has been months since this had happened and there is still no resolution. If I left a McDonald's with ten dollars worth of food they would have me arrested but because I am a customer they are fine with stealing my money and my time. This is a terrible McDonald's and because of this experience I will no longer be going to any McDonald's in the future.",0
Hours are NOT accurate.,0
"It literally took my boyfriend an hour and 13 minutes to receive our food. (two meals)
I get it,  things happen and it's one thing to be understaffed, but maybe corporate needs to step in to save this location.
We won't be back",0
"Poor service and always crowded. But hey it's McDonald's,  what should we expect.",0
Staff Super Ghetto,0
Worst McDonald's experience I've ever had.  They were so slow I wanted to bolt out the drive thru,0
"Worst McDonald ever. The workers are really rude, don know how to work, take millions of year to prepare the food OR take your order and when you try to ask for basic things like drinks they treat you bad or ignore you. I waited for them to give me my coke for around 15 minutes and when they finally hand it to me, it was a Dr. pepper, guess what? I waited 10 minutes more for them to have the decency to",0
"Every time I come here they never get the order right, and if they do they never give the correct sauce. It don",0
"The absolute worst McDonald in New Jersey , r",0
Why did you give me all the wrong orders?,0
"I've disliked McDonald's for a long time now, they're always missing something of ours, ice cream machine is always down, their employees seem like they don't even know what to do. I waited for this lady to take my money for 5 minutes and all she did was look at me and took the drive thru orders. So I just pulled up to the other window to pay and it took another 4-5 minutes to friggin pay. Never again going to ANY McDonald's, ever.",0
cold food,0
"TERRIBLE SERVICE!
Asked for the manager for refil e he turn around and started to do another thing completely different. ZERO ATTENTION TO CUSTOMER. I",0
Went to order a shake at this location they said McDonald,0
Worst macdonald  in the world. There are people asking for money in there which is very ,0
"Dirty, unkind, too long waiting time, too high work load with minimum of employees",0
"Tl;Dr poor service, frequently gets orders wrong.

We try and avoid this place even when we specifically have a hankering for McDonald's. We always have an issue at this McDonald's no matter what time of day,  whether we order from a food delivery service or in person. The orders always get screwed up,  from missing items to getting a sausage egg and cheese mcgriddle that just had cheese! If there was other fast food options besides pizza and halal nearby we'd probably never go here again.
But today I finally understood why it's a mess: there's no communication. It was a busy time since school had just let out and I stood for about 5 minutes waiting for a Dr. Pepper and watched the crew work in relative silence while pushing out food orders without tickets and without speaking to each other. Anyone who has worked in food service knows a quiet kitchen spells more trouble than a loud one. Eventually my sister flagged down the man doing drink orders and asked if the drink he'd just placed in the row of 8 other drinks he'd been setting down indiscriminately was our Dr. Pepper and he said yes...it was a Coke.
Management here really needs to have a talk to the crew about working together as a team and communication, especially when it's busy. Yes it's just a McDonald's, and I'm not expecting white glove service from a fast food joint, but our community deserves better than what we're getting for sure.",0
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. I get it only food but it fast food. We waited over thirty minutes for our food and should be called slow food. We waited at the drive thru first and no one was taking orders then we went inside and had to order on the kiosk because they told us too. Why h,0
Horrible The fries taste like ass,0
Service and costumer service awful horrible!!,0
"This is a below average McDonald's.  The self-ordering machines don't print receipts with your number so you better catch it on the screen because they may or may not see it on the system.  Fortunately, I was only getting some sodas and they didn't question my order but if it had been a real order it might not have gone smoothly.",0
Waited in drive thru for 20 minutes had to go in to get our order.manager was great but they had everyones order messed up.,0
Waited 20 min for a qtr pounder at 3am only to witness a worker scrape the onions off my burger with her bare hands I asked for a new burger she argued that I didn't see her do this  absolutely unacceptable,0
Not clean place. Poor service.,0
"My only visit to this shop and I witnessed these: 1) There were two lines but suddenly one of the staff members stopped taking orders and closed the point-of-sales machine.  Those customers on that line were told to go at the back of the other line.
2) I understand that some staff are new but the supervisor or senior staff are rude to the new staff and do not help train them.  I don understand the yelling (probably because they are in Spanish).
3) Majority of staff speak Spanish and announce numbers in Spanish.  Expect some misunderstanding when they are taking your order too.  One of the staff put in hot coffee when I ordered hot coffee.
4) Be prepared to wait in a long line and always check your order before you leave the pick up counter.  It was my fault that I did not check/realize my Big Mac and South West salad dressing are missing when I felt.

TLDR?; just don쐬羲s will always be a bad decision anyway.",0
Really bad customer service. Not once but twice with two different employees. Asked for condiments and you would think they were doing me a favor.,0
This store always gice me a hard time I don't like the staff at all,0
Can't even take an order correctly! Couldn't repeat the order back or even put it on the screen for us to review.,0
Lot of areas to improve,0
"The morning crew is professional, to they are a stellar group,  but the midnight shift is horrible, food is cold, desserts we're squashed and when I showed them the muffins she said""that's how they came out""",0
The parking lot is one of the worst. All the spots are way too narrow and cramped.,0
"Degenerates served me a chicken sandwich which was completely burnt to where it was as hard as a rock, cold and dry as if it was left out for days and none of them had mental Acuity to not put that piece of garbage in my bag of food",0
Ice cream was gritty and the fudge they put on my daughters sundae was runny and tasted a little like coffee. We trashed it before we left the parking lot. Better luck next time.,0
"Attention Veterans. This location doesn't participate in November 11th Veteran's Day discounts. The employees and Manager didn't know what that meant. McDonald's headquarters is nearby, it's on the news, and it happens every year. You will learn today.",0
"Just awful....remember when Mcd's was good food quality? I actually do....now, they really do suck!",0
This place has changed a lot.They forget about your order or forgets certain things in your order.Now there are more homeless's.Now there are teenagers working there and messing up your order.My grandma asked for a ice cream cone but they gave her a cup instead.I recommend going to a different McDonald's for right now until they fix the problems.,0
"Just went and got 4 McChicken, 1 Large French fry a medium one and a cheeseburger.

The entire order was old. French fries were saggy like and old lady titis. The McChicken tastes like they were cooked a month ago. Aaaah wait no coke because the machine was down. First is the shake machine and now the coke. Come on man. Worst MCDONALD Ever fuuuuck",0
"WINDOW STAFF PERSON SAID THEY DID NOT RECEIVED AN ONLINE PICKUP ORDER?  WE HAD AN ONLINE ORDER NUMBER?
WT???!!",0
This McDonald's needs help as I was getting my breakfast there was a transient sitting down on the table not buying anything a man comes in wants to sit down and eat his food that he bought and the transit try to beat him up and the man's food was all over the floor this McDonald's needs help always the homeless people have dominated this place,0
Not only was it packed and slow moving but our mobile app that said ready in 3-5 minutes actually tool close to 15 minutes. A BIG thing was having to pay to have a refill on your drink. That is ridiculous.,0
"We have visited this McDonald twice now using the drive through. It took forever both times - the car in front only ordering 1 or 2 items! First time it took around 10 minutes to order and then we had to wait for the food another 10 minutes.
Second time too",0
Service declined....,0
The worst service ever... the people behind us got their orders but our order never been processed. We decided to cancel our order instead. The manager never apologized for that error. I still got the receipt. If ever the corporate head wants to contact me I am willing to give them what took place in that McDonald's. I hope the manager will get fired for it!!!!,0
They don,0
"Waited almost 30 minutes to get my food, while people with bigger orders that came after me, got their food. When asked what was taking so long, they said they are working on the order, then followed by asking me what my order was. After wards, had another employee who knew what was going on come out to ask me again what order was, had to stand there and watch them put my food into a microwave. The worst experience ever.",0
Gross.,0
I sat in drive through Tuesday night around 11:30 PM for 20 minutes and pull up to order and associate says sorry we are closed I explained to him that I had been waiting already for over 20 minutes and he mumbled something and said sorry the website says open 24hrs,0
Not open 24 hours -_- they said they close from 2 am - 6 am even the drive-thru but they will serve people ordering on food delivery apps? Didn't make much sense to me when they are supposed to be open 24 hours and still make food for delivery orders,0
McDonald's is the worst the foods always cold and they recook old food when you ask for it hot but the frappes are the bomb that's why they got a star.,0
Food always cold,0
Let just say this place would be a lot better if they had a different crew member. There is a orange red hair lady names Veronica who does the window mostly and she ALWAYS has a attitude. If you don want to work at McDonalds then gone because their are people who take customer service ,0
"Always incomplete order, when u order cream and equal with your order, they never give, and when u ask for it, they just ignore you",0
The food was not fresh,0
disapointed ,0
"I ordered a strawberry smoothie, they gave me a mango smoothie instead, I told them I ordered a strawberry smoothie, their crew is very upset. Than she brought me a strawberry smoothie, and told me this is the size for smoothie.",0
I've been to this location a few times and everytime I have been the food is always old and the fries taste like they have been sitting for hours. They are always out of sweet tea and coffee and it seems like nobody cares about the quality of food that is being served.,0
Wish I could give a ZERO... food was horrible and the whole order was wrong.. paid extra for cheese no cheese no mayonnaise on anything. Food was cold and to top it off the dime size tomatoes on each sandwich 7 sandwiches and 2 were right.. cant post the pictures on here or I would.. service unacceptable,0
"High volume drive thru, with heavy wait time. This McDonald's can't handle amount of people that here. If you want to wait a long time for the meal. Then you came to the right palce",0
"They did not attend me and given the size standards, it is not open to enter inside, only to shop on the outside, it has to say that only people with a car can buy in this store, terrible services",0
"The waiter was impolite, bad tone, and impatient?
I don't know what is impatient with the waiter?
",0
"I tried to use a coupon to get a free medium fries from the Mcdonald app along with my other items i purchased and after the scanned the coupon they gave me small fries. I even heard them making comments about the free coupon. Also the women at the window seem to be fooling around too much hence the extremely long line during lunch and dinner times. I stopped by 4 times in one week and had an issue each time.

The young white guy at the first window is really nice though hence the 2 stars instead of 1",0
Terrible,0
"Food was good. Everything was right, but they never have any of the toys offered on the mconalds preorder app exept for what they call inisex, which is really just for boys, and were very short with me and rude when i asked for a proper toy for my little 2 yr old daughter. She is obviously not into a avengers.",0
Terrible,0
"Never go there I asked for pic up Order, and the guy came to have the order without gloves..... I called them and they was very rude",0
"Food was cold,",0
Wanted a small combo and was told combos only come in medium and large. That if I wanted a small had to order everything separate. How stupid just to make an extra buck,0
Always has disgusting smelly homeless people lying around,0
"Kid wouldn't take our order with cash but took a single girls order with cash.

Walked us to a kiosk. This world's so screwed. And this McDonald's is racist. Would get negative if possible.",0
Worst McDonald's experience ive ever had worst staff unprofessional and nasty the place was a pig stuy and everyone was lost and i got told off by one of the young ladies. I will never ever go there again and i urge all to avoid this McDonald's due to the filthiness of the restaurant. Something needs to be done ill be looking forward to a response from upper management.,0
"This place is a hot mess! Very unorganized staff, poor management. multiple orders wrong, wait time is insane for a fast food joint.",0
"Drive through experience. Long line, no problem, tourist area. Took a while to take my order. When I paid, the person didn't even make eye contact, he gave me my receipt without saying a word except for the total and shut the window. Then, went to the 2nd window where the guy gave me the water bottle and sent me to the 3rd window. By the time I paid, at 10:02 pm, it was 10:20 pm and I was still waiting on anyone to come to the 3rd window. Then a female employee brought me a kid's meals and when I asked her for the rest of the order, she waved her hand and said ""I don't know"" with an attitude. She left and I waited 5 more mins before anyone came to the window. A male manager came and I explained what was missing plus to look at the happy meal that only had 4 fries, cold nuggets, no toy, no sauce, no napkins. When I showed the kid's meal, he said what happened to the fries? (as if we ate them). I looked at him and said ""that's what you guys gave me and to look at the camera"". He then said ""hold on"" and slammed the window. Another 5 mins go by, gave me the food and I asked where is the sauce and he said the 1st bag, but it wasn't there. As he was getting me the sauce, I told him this was the worst service ever and that I was going to put a review. He shrugged his shoulders, slammed the window and left. I then proceeded to hunk my horn very loudly to see if he came back to the window, but he never did.
I'm a store manager myself and I would never tolerate a behavior like that from any of my managers or from any of my team members. My 6 year old grand-daughter was in the car and was crying with this upsetting situation.
I visit this location at least 3-4 times a week, never had problems like this with the other shifts.",0
Terrible,0
"I only go here for breakfast, I don't like there regular menu items.",0
"If I could give zero stars, I would, the employees are very rude ..",0
My food was overcooked. The lettuce they put on my hot & spicy was brown and it looked like it needed to thrown away. I waited almost twenty minutes for a six dollar meal. Their fountain drink machine needs to be fixed. The orange hi-c is just orange syrup and the sprite taste like carbonated water. I wont be going back there!,0
Good poisoning,0
Needs major improvements all around,0
I don't like,0
We are so disappointed in McDonald's now. It used to be very good. Now the service is horrible we didn't get a chance to find out about the food because we had to leave,0
Order was wrong,0
Manager is no good fire him,0
Terrible,0
Probably the worst McDondalds I have felt with on a consistent basis in my life. Management is rude employees don't care and something is ALWAYS wrong with my order.,0
10/11/2021 12:45am location is closed. Staff member stated location is no longer 24 hours due to no staff.,0
"Slowest drive thru I EVER EXPERIENCED. Ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!!!! Over a half hour, REALLY!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?",0
"There are plenty of comments about poor service, not enough about poor quality of food. Not only did they mess up multiple orders, the chicken was undercooked and not eatable. Go eat somewhere else, this location won't meet even your lowest expectations of this brand.",0
"Don't eat here! Order is always wrong, takes forever, fries are cold and gross. Dining room ""closes"" at 11pm. NOPE! Really closes at like 8pm. Update the hours on your door!!! When we knocked on the door and pointed to the sign, THE MANAGER FLIPPED US OFF!

Cooperate needs to fire most the staff, all the managers, and get new people in there.",0

Very Rude staff :-( had me wait in line for 30 minutes will never go to this mcdonalds again...,0
Frys were cool and soggy. The double quarter pounder w/cheese was slapped together were one beef paddy going one way and the other one going the other. It was stuck that which made it hard to eat.,0
Service was extremely slow  and order was incorrect.  Employee that gave me the order was very nice and corrected the order.,0
I got food poisoning from the Pico de Gallo signature crafted sandwich. This is the sandwich I ate on the parking lot floor,0
"Poor service

Yall need to get better customer service and have everything up and working and yall need to sale everything even fries in the morning",0
As a frequent customer of this McDonald I am furious that you have your workers working under a heat wave with no type of air conditioning. I walked in to order with my kids and had to take my order to the car and eat in car which was very uncomfortable with 4 kids bet way better than eating in a place where it was difficult to breath. If you treat your employees like this than this is the reason your customer service in this locate is poor. As a franchise you shouldn be involved in this type of business never the less in any type of customer service business. I will not be returning to this location as my money is worth more to other busine,0
Their cheeseburger costs more than a double cheeseburger and they won't give me a double cheeseburger with only 1 patty,0
We go to this McDonalds because they had a really cool electronic board that the kids could play on it was interactive and very neat well for the last five times they tell us the board is broke.. we only get a drink there I'm so we only go to for the play area and since it's broke my son has been very sad,0

"The fries were too greasy and the bread was disgusting. Watch out for the homeless people! One of them gave me a wedgie while i was waiting in line for my food. thank you

The exit from the parking lot has a huge sign that blocks the view of on coming traffic.,0
Slow as molasses and still couldnt get it right. Dont go here after 12am. Had to go inside and get my $1 soda they forgot to give me.,0
Bad customer  service,0
My order is always wrong. I was making my order in the drive through she ask me what I wanted to drink when I answer she we have no soda.smh,0
Poor ,0
"For one usually it's only for coffee and to get away from the office as I stopped eating McDonald's food. The problem I faced recently was a homeless person who walked up to me and asked for 2 dollars for bus fare. When the bus stop is like 2 to three blocks down the road. I said I will buy you something to eat or drink but not give money. So,  for folks or tourists who get folks coming to them asking for money I suggest trying to offer food to them is more important then money. One thing about DC is there is alot of resources for folks who need money for bus fare or anything can find. Food too they know where to go. It's up to them to make that move. Another major situation I noticed is the McDonald's need some updating. I might know why they keep it so dull looking because McDonald's operates with the homeless so I guess they don't want to make it too comfortable. I been to much better ones who got nice and cool lounge chairs couches and OMG this one just looks ragged.",0
Poor ,0
They hire unprofessional people who can't even speak proper English. The workers are always forgetting something in your order. Ohh and the ice cream never works!,0
"Store says open 24 hour, but employees, blasting music says that they're not open?? Beware, lazy employees. Boycotting this location.",0
"If I could I wouldn't even give one star to this location , employees are very rude and disrespectful. I dont understand how they get away by not getting discipline .
They need a huge training on customers satisfaction skills .otherwise they should look for a different kind of work where they dont have to be seen to avoid their behavioral issues at the workplace",0
They gave me cold apple pies and stale chicken nuggets I want my money back,0
I ordered a coffee through drive-through this morning.  What I got is a cup of water!,0
The worst and most expensive McDonalds I have ever seen. I had to request a manager to intervene before the cashier would let me order what I wanted instead of what she wanted me to buy. Definitely not a happy meal.,0
Terrible the place you could not sit down as an excuse the pandemic not recommended to go to this mc establishment,0
Order of fries and a cup of coffee.  Ordered on app in the restaurant.  Took 20-25 minutes to receive,0

"Not busy, but slow service. Very unkept restaurant, garbage scattered, and fountain drinks/ice depleted.",0
Here I ate my last Mac hamburger of my life. It is a promise. Never more,0
Don't get the breakfast burritos they advertise a nice beautiful looking burrito on their menu and then when you get it it's a quarter of the size of which they advertise the price has gone up on these and the quality has gone way down they have false advertising on their menu,0
"Very dirty
Table never cleaned
Restroom out of order
Do not forget to bring your maid with you if you need clean table",0
"I went to get iced coffee this morning and they say ""we dont have iced coffee""",0
Lowest mcdonalds,0
Sat in drive thru for very long time to be told no fountain drinks no frappes no coffee and food was meh,0
The kids wanted it ...the kids loved it they had nuggets and fries....it's McDonald's...the service at drive through is borderline passive aggressive  but you can't complain well it's like say your order and here's your meal...lol but it's McDonald's,0
"This place is not very clean. When I first walked in, I heard yelling from a waitress saying ?02, 302?and there were many insects in this ",0
"Pretty awful. No human interaction, kiosks not super intuitive, paying cash... waited 10( a while, maybe not 10)minutes at a register to pay cash. Will go to Wendy's instead. Dirty tables and a homeless looking person helping customers on the self serve kiosks",0
The employees cannot count for nothing. On top of that the coffee tasted like cardboard it's very obvious they do not clean their machines. Disgusting store.,0
I had to give 2 star because I've been trying to call the phone number listed on the website multiple times and no one responded or go to voice mail with Verizon. I had few missing items that I wanted to report. The food came fast but I have had better food from McDonald's than from this location.,0
"Somehow I always get overcharged here.
Aside from that.
Had one hamburger literally
One burger ketchup extra pickles patty bread no freaking mustard cuz mustard don't go on  hamburgers
Anyway I ate it just to go home and vomit It was horrible I was sick the whole rest of the day.",0
"This McDonald's location used to be great. Since their renovation it's been just a disaster. Customer service is non existent, managers and staff are all in the kitchen pushing food out. No one at the front to help, just disgraceful...",0
Horrible service they got my order wrong.,0
"Employees I dealt with were rude. When they got our order wrong they tried to blame it on us not ordering right. We showed them the receipt and still refused to admit they were wrong. The girl went to the back and came back with the right order, didn't say anything or make eye contact, just handed me the bag. This is the rudest I have ever been treated at any establishment, fast food or not. I recommend everyone drive a little farther up the road to the next McDonald's than deal with what I had to deal with.",0
"This McDonald's has a group of homeless people that take up many seats by the bathrooms. Unfortunately, they add a bad odor to the area where they congregate.",0
Always closing early,0
Regularly not open during listed hours on McDonald's website.,0
It is super terrible bad food they never change the oil poorly cooked food I do not recommend the potatoes black horn from burnt oil,0
Worst mcdonalds ever. They pretend they dont have anything on the menu and pretend they dont have any sizes other than large. South beach deserves a better  restaurant.,0

I heard a man ask to enter the mens restroom to just wash his hands while they were cleaning, the person cleaning refused and then he asked the lady at the register if he could ask the person cleaning to let him inside the restroom and she told him to go to the womens restroom with a huge attitude! Really rude workers.",0

Just ok service,0
Terrible. The service is always slow at this location. I go to McDonald's at least 3 times a week. Elgin manor austin. This location not so often and every time I go I remember why I don't go toooooo slow. Everytime!!!,0
Terrible,0
Worst thing here at this location is ordering from the app an waiting for your order over 20 minutes now they need to get better service.,0
Took 20 minutes inside this morning for 1 sausage & bisquit.  Food was OK. Warm.,0
There tea was nasty and there meal where cold,0
"Not very good customer service at all except for the manager, more training needed to deal with people",0
Terrible service!!! they don't give you everything you asked for and apart from their ineptitude they get upset because you go for what you paid for the net if they don't want to work don't go!!! Do not waste time and review the orders well before delivering them,0
"Bathroom it was a disgraceful experience. Lobby tables dirty. Drinking fountain super dirty. Hamburger box came oily. Unfortunately, it was NOT a great experience and cleaning McDonald's. Better to give up on McDonald's for once and for ALL. You can base a restaurant by their bathrooms.",0
Today i ordered two mcmuffin meal i asked for my sandwiches to be Specifically made a certain way I order my food pull up to the window she tells me to park out front and they will bring my order i waited outside for 15 minutes just for them to bring my drink the girl was sooo confused i asked her where is the food she said you didn get it i said no i gave her my receipt then she had the nerve to look in my car as if i was lying took another ten minutes to get my order i get home and my order was incorrect i spent 16.50 on extras on my sandwich that i didn,0
It is clean but they do not turn on the heating in the children's area and the manager ignores this request,0
THEEE WORST MCDONALDS EVER,0
Workers are loud in kitchen playing around...not professional. Not coming back here,0
Worst experience ever!!!  Didn't have anything on the menu. When we finally found something we could actually get it was cold. The buns had been toasted long before the burger was made. Not even warm enough to melt the cheese!!  Never again!!,0
"I've been there twice. My order was completely messed up both times. The first time they offered to make the missing burger and make fresh fries. I waited 20 min before I said, I want my food or my money now. I got my burger and the same fries she took from me 20 min ago. I watched them screw up order after order while spending time playing and flirting. Horrible place. Needs real management. Not management trying to get into their co workers pants.",0
"The App let's you order breakfast and pay ahead, but when you show up and it's 10:03, their system won't let them complete your order.

The location is relatively good, the employees are always friend and fast.

But someone needs to pass along yo the corporate office/app devs and need to either decide to

1) prepare prepaid breakfast orders and have them ready before the 10:00 shut off, or

2) allow them to prepare my prepaid breakfast order 3 minutes after ""it's no longer breakfast time""

I do not want to eat a burger as my first meal of the day at 10:03 on the way to work.",0
You would find the Covid-19 vaccine here before you found a working ice cream machine,0
All our burgers were not cooked!!!,0
Female cashier was rude and was very unprofessional. If you are a tourist and don't know when it is cash only you don't get a receipt do not yell at the customer like we supposed to know what is going on. The only good thing about going was lemuel he was a great help. I would not want the girl to serve us with that attitude.,0
The staff here does not take orders well,0
Wait for almost an hour for the order. The delivery lady missed our table and send our food to another table. Worst M store ever,0
Poor ,0
"Atmosphere is cool and unique. Ordered pasta and cheesesteaks. The wait time was forever, service was definitely slow. But it was also Easter and spring break weekend. But what was odd was that we got our cheesesteaks and waited an extra 30 minutes for our fries and milkshakes. That was weird and frustrating.",0
"My family and I came here and we were all disappointed. They were not welcoming and they had a line, didn even bother asking anyone what they needed. The people needed to stop the worker and ask for what they needed, no one was ever at the counter. We are Hispanic and we also felt discriminated against because the lady at the counter didn want to give us refills and didn",0
Terrible,0
Rude and unattentive staff.   They were not even busy and I asked can I order my food at the register basically was told you have to use the kiosk and she walked away from me.  Not offering any type of assistance or making you feel welcome in any way.  I turned around and walked out the door.,0
Slow as a frozen pig and service was no good,0
Warning- Check your order every time you come to this location. Guaranteed to be missing an item you ordered. Don let them tell you,0
"Very slow serving, I don't know if there was many new people in kitchen. But I had to mention what else they forgotten in my order in order to get it.",0
Worst McDonalds  I've ever been to. Waited over twenty minutes.  Burgers were almost  raw. Plus no toys in happy meals.,0
Trash Service. The Bag with my food in it had some type substance on the bag that got my hands.,0
This is the slowest McDonald's I've ever experienced.  The staff is difficult to deal with and 5 out of 5 times our order is wrong. Great location and clean facilities though.,0
I came in at 10:30 on a Sunday and no dam breakfast.really? The only thing I want at 10:30 in the morning on a Sunday is an egg mc muffin. They had no pancakes. I only drink coffee and have breakfast at McDonald's and they didn't have acceptable breakfast products.,0
Full of homeless people hanging out asking for money & if u tell them no some of them will attack u,0
"Don't waste your time at this McDonald's. You will be waiting for at least 30 minutes to get your food. Kiosk ordering is also messed up at this location, and doesn't work like it does at other locations.",0
This week I went twice for coffee I ask for it with cream and sugar and it came to work and the coffee without sugar what a courage,0
Order food here and wait 30 mins for your order.... no fast food here,0
"The drive thru is not open 24 hrs. Theres nothing worse than driving to a location advertising being open only to get there and see the cleaning person ignore you as you try to ask for the hours.

Edit: finally was able to get the attention of an employee who says they close from 4am to 5:30am",0
"Been coming to this Mc Donald's every time I'm in the area never had a bad experience till today, I ordered a double quarter pounder with cheese meal, by far the Greasiest Burger I've ever had in my life nasty.",0
This is a horrible mcdMcDonal,0
"super dirty all around. attitude of the people in there is gross, they almost trow the food at you. go to another McDonald's and save yourself the bad experience.",0
"Rude customer service, especially coming from the shift manager.",0
"They are always late in their orders
I was there today 10/02/22 with my family and my food were done 40min late
They need more management",0
"I was order take out, they May used return food (cold burger  ,different bread , cheese)",0
"I'm allergic to onions, I tell them every single time to not add onions and for the last 3 visits my burgers continue to have onions put on.. I end up switching my meal with my wife because she doesn't want me to get sick or go hungry.. I worked at McDonald's, its not that difficult to build a burger without adding onions.. DO BETTER!!",0
"Dirty and unkempt. Limited staff around so tables not cleaned.
Seems to be a popular place for the homeless to visit.",0
"Fries under cooked
Chicken nuggets over cooked,  always messing up my order and this us 4th time ,never coming back just horrible service.",0
Just went through the drive thru and literally was in line for about 20 mins start to finish. For being a fast food they are super slow. They are in the heart of Orland and do not do a good job. My French fries were cold. One of my kids drink was empty and the cookies I ordered were completely wrong. I would suggest going to q near by restaurant which they have faster service than these people.,0
"The worst McDonald's in Miami, horrible waiting time, only one cook, bitter employees, a disaster with Uber Eats... you want to save yourself a hard time, don't come here!",0
I've visited this establishment on three differences occasions and they've all been the same experience.... RUDE and A TAD BIT RACIST. No More Business from me personally.,0
"Nobody is working. Cars lined up in the drive thru, not a soul around. Worst service ever.",0
"Rainy first night in Orlando, we went here after a super long day at Disney World. We waited over 20 min for our food in the drive thru! None of our order was correct and it was pouring rain so I did not want to go back through the slow drive thru. I mean McDonald's is what it is, but people go there for quick and convenient and those components were def missing on this particular visit. 占쏙",0
This place is the worst!  I came down on a 3 day vacation and spent two of them with violent food poisoning!!!!! This was the only food I had within the 24 hour mark.  I,0
Terrible,0
"Bad service. No one knows the menu. Says open 24hrs,but drive thru opens at 4am.  Dine in not open either.",0
"The ebt machine did not work so I used cash but they couldn't give me the correct change because they were out so they tried to short me at first .. I did not get syrup with my breakfast, the sink did not work in the restroom, the security guard was cursing at the customers who are all homeless people, a lady hooked up speakers in the restroom.. I don't get it, I felt like I was in the twilight zone",0
They are very disorganized and having customers waiting on orders that they gave away to other people,0
"Terrible service. We bought a whole bunch of items and asked for an ice water.

They refused to SELL ice water to us.

I have never been to a McDonalds that REFUSES to SELL ice water. (It's usually free)

Also, the lady who took our order could barely understand English and had to ask another employee to translate for her. We ended up repeating our order three times.

This is probably the worst service I have ever had at McDonalds.",0
"I ordered 2 of thier ""premium"" chichen sandwiches,  TOTALLY GROSS,  AND SOGGY COLD DOES",0
Ordered quarter pounder on 2 different nights and both times burger was still raw in the middle. Totally unacceptable for place that sells food. Stay away unless you want E. Coli poisoning.,0
A much needed effort in prompt customer service and cleanliness.,0
"The worst drive thru service I've ever had anywhere. From the time I started paying attention to how long I was waiting in line til the time I was given my food was 48 mins. At least 10 mins before that I was waiting in line not paying attention to how long I'd been there.  So roughly an hour to get my food. Then only to be treated rudely  by the cashier, because somehow I was supposed to know they wanted cash only. Not sure why, since I had no choice but to run my debit card and it went through just fine and in a normal amount of time. I'll never go there again. I'll drive a few mins to another location.",0
What staff they had were working hard but the place was a mess in service was very slow.,0
Slowest drive thru ever,0
"The worst service. The staff is rude, the food takes time to be served. I do not recommend it at all. One of the worst McDonald's I've been to.",0
"I placed an order... the young lady at the drive thru kept having issues getting the order correctly... I paid for my order... went to the second window.. was given a huge bag that almost broke through with stuff... I pulled up just a little bit to check my order:  noticed I was missing an item, fries, so I pulled around to let the lady at the first window know I퐉 missing something... she just dismissed me to the 2nd window... and the 2 ladies at the second window weren the best either.  When I stated I drove back around because I was missing my fries.. I didn realize my receipt was in the bag to confirm my order.. found it and gave it to one of the ladies... the second lady, I퐉 guessing to be heard due to my inconvenience of my order not being correct, for her to take ownership for what possibly could of went wrong and show some compassion instead of being kind of prude ... after I received the fries the manager dismissed me with a condescending ",0
Poor ,0
"The person who took our order charged us for a large meal and then rang in a small drink. When I questioned the girl giving us our items, she got defensive and accused the drink machine. She argued with us the entire time she was fixing the problems. Never again.",0
"Had diarrhea after a burger, not clean.",0
"Bad, rude, usless stuff. Maybe not everybody but at least 3 ladies herd when i ask about help but no one helped me...",0
It opens when it won't openY'all say 24/7 but y'all not open 24/7,0
"This store is so disorganized, plenty of people working not all that busy yet took 27 minutes to get food. I'm sure this is not the mcDonalds model.",0
"Dirty, crowded and loud.",0
"Staff wasn friendly AT ALL and these are literally the worst, coldest, most unsalted, most un",0
"Stayed downtown stopped for sandwich and coke. Coke machine was broken; homeless all over the lobby, bathrooms had homeless in and out with obvious drug use. Employee was too worried about the bathroom door lock and messed up a 2 sandwhich order. Manager quickly fixed. Typical big city overpriced trashy fast food place. Felt like I was back in New York City.",0
disapointed ,0
They forgot about me in the drive-thru after asking me to pull to the third window. If I could leave 0 stars I would. Finally went into the store to see my bag sitting on the counter for so long it needed to be remade.,0
"They are advertising the new crispy chicken sandwich meal for $6, yet lied twice, once saying it was a mobile order, which is a lie, I took a pic, second that it didn't start, so why advertise, so sad, worse customer service in Mcdonald's",0
"bad service, they don't respect the time indicated on the sign, mc Donald's disrespect for the customer, constantly decay",0
I find it scary sometimes... They take forever with the orders.. Nearly 30 Min wait..,0
"I can't believe they took away all the amazing animals and put in a Modern Farmhouse McDonald's. The previous McDonald's was iconic. This new renovation just looks like every other new McDonald's, nothing unique about it.",0
My fries were cold (thats all I ordered) and took 14 minutes.,0
The customer service is not really good....!  Need more Organized...!,0
"At first, I felt hungry so I went to this very fancy Mickey D's.  But then while getting back home ( which was a long way from the Santa Monica Pier ) I felt nostalgic and my stomach was hurting really bad.  So I had to stop at Carl's Jr. on  Newhall for the bathroom.",0
"I fed my cat two of the three burgers I ordered, it later died.",0
"Very bad service the employees are very roud the security guy not professional
I won't never come back to this ugly store",0
Windows service Very bad rude no wear gloves touch food soda everything also rude to complain customer need wear gloves so bad experience very rude lady,0
HORRIBLE SERVICE. LIKE REALLY BAD. GO OUT OF YOUR WAY AND FIND ANOTHER NEARBY MCDONALDS,0
"Went to eat at 3:40 am.  And the guy tells me that there's only mc chicken sandwiches. And that's all.  And if I wanted breakfast, I'd have to wait till 4 am.  Ridiculous.",0
Placed a mobile order and it went through. I ordered large fries but then the manager refused to give me my order because their system was down. I showed her my order and she still refused. She said I should cancel it. When I asked how she said she didn't know how. Horrible service,0
Mcchicken  missing chicken.,0
"I have been living in this city for the last 3 years , I took the decision to make a quick stop and get something to eat , wouuu food 5 stars special the coffee,  perfect coffee but the customer service wouuu 1 star is not enough ( the indian lady that I think is the manager ) terrible customer service and she was so rude with this customer that requeted and ketchup ... they really need to improve that...",0
"It took 1 plus hours to get thru the drive thru.  The drive thru is such that once in line you cannot get out. No one apologised for the abnormal wait time. When I got my food, the fries where cold and the taste old. I usually to not complain about a restaurant but 1 plus hours in a drive thru line is ludicrous. Especially for a fast food establishment.",0
They dont know respect no customer service,0
This is the worst McDonald's on the planet not one of the rude Cubans that work there don't deserve to make a hamburger.,0
"Only two power outlets in the whole place and the best one is at the ""employee's"" table. Noisy and confused environment. Not for business people. Has a 60 minute time limit on  Internet.",0
No drive thru ?,0
"Food was the bog standard, biggest issues here are:
1. The cheeseburger I ordered had a hard bun.
2. Service was terribe there should be lines or devides to clearly mark queing lanes rather than someone shouting ""There are three lines"" and there be nobody serving in the other 2.
3. They messed up my order (seems to be the case in every McDonald's in NYC they seem to miss out 2 of the things on my order, that being fries or drink.)
Wouldn't recomend.",0
Can,0
I was eating here and the parking enforcement booted my car while I was eating. I produced a receipt but the man who booted my car accused me of leaving the premises so eating at this mcdonalds cost 75.00$. Dont ever go here!,0
The service was terrible. They got my order wrong twice and they didn't have me my fries with my food. And the first time they miss something in my order....,0
"The inside smells like baby diapers. When you ask for extra sweet and sour sauce they give you a dirty look like it is such a hassle. The ice cream machine is always broken, and the food always looks like it was put together so carelessly. Guess you can't expect much from a McDonald's anyways.",0
"Lobby still closed even though Whataburger and everyone else has opened up.  So, you get to spend 20 to 30 minutes waiting in the drive through line to place an order that half the time they screw up.  Happened again today.  A simple #1 meal with a coke.  Got only the Big Mac and nothing else.  Pointed it out to the lady and handed her the bag back.  She disappeared for few minutes and when she returned with my order, shoved it at me and rudely turned away like it was all my fault.  This is probably the worst run McDonald's in the area.   Don't recommend it at all.",0
The worst McDonald I have ever been to and will never go back again. We had to repeat our order like 5 times and they still messed up ,0
Worst they messed up ny whole order an are slow bunch of kids,0
Very slow service today!!,0
"I don usually do reviews but today, one of the worst service I퐒e ever received. As I pulled in the drive thru the girl working (Elizabeth)  it had a really bad attitude I honestly don know if she having a bad morning or something but she didn",0
"The service was slow, there were 4 people ahead if me and only 1 cashier.  Then it looks like the manager or supervisor opened up.  They didn't have Sprite, or Hi-C orange.  Some guy in a black tank top got up from the table and walked to the back where they were preparing food. Now I realized it was an employee, not in uniform.  Bathroom was out of order and every table that I went to was dirty.  It's been a while since I've eaten in there, it looks like new management??  I'm concerned.",0
"waited in the drive through for over half an hour, all i got for my trouble was a ""sorry for the wait"" not even an explanation. When I got to the second window there were at least a dozen sodas just sitting on the counter. It's not the first time I've had bad service. I once pulled up and they just said we're not serving right now even though it was smack dab in the middle of the day hours.",0
I have never seen such a slow mc donasl in my life.,0
"Too many homeless people sleeping at night. Near the restrooms & nobody is taking them out of the place. It supposed to say ""limit seating time 20 minutes"" & worst of all. Nobody is renovating the place with the red shingles & the Playplace too. Please do something about this!",0
Awwwwful service!!!! Waited for our order for over 20 minutes. Worst McDonald's experience!!!!! Stay away!!!,0
Not the same as it use to be,0
"As always the service is slow,  its a busy spot, i get it. Today the # s were way past mine, now i have to stand in line, because i was told just a minute several times to find out about my order....now i just want my money back not hungry anymore. The Sup. Did fix the problem though i dont know what was said. ( i still only speak our official language) 36 minutes later out the door with an "" i appolagize""

update: Avoid this place! Didn't think it possible it could get slower, dirtier or more Dangerous. WOW.
My Bad.      ",0
Worst MCdonalds experience ever. 40 minutes and counting and no order. Don't ever stop here unless you want to get extremely mad,0
Sat in drive thru lane for 45min at 3:40 AM. Ridiculous wait time. Ended up going to Checkers.,0
"After a few unsuccessful visits, I have the impression you'll be served if the staff happen to feel like it.",0
"Waited in drive-thru for 30 mins, finally got up to order & nothing. We kept asking if anyone is there. Kid finally comes on that they had to reboot the system & could be another 15 mins at least. We told him he needs to tell people as there is a line around the building. Truly horrible service.",0
Place smells security staff is a joke,0
"Placed a mobile order for pickup. Waited 15 minutes for a single burger that never got called. All of that wouldn't be so bad but when I called for a refund I was lied to by the manager that they called my order, which they did not. I stood inside for 15 minutes watching the counter to see if they had my order. So they lied and kept my money.",0
No open 24hs as promised,0
"Normally food is good.this morning had to go to a funeral early. We got an order of pancakes (cold), 4 egg McMuffins, had sausage inside, 2 sausage and cheese cold. 2 cold light, got 1 black the other no sugar. Got to the window was told move up. Waited 15 minutes for food was told by the person you are being served by a maintenance man enjoy.",0
Bad,0
one of the worst McDonald's I have ever been to. bun was so stale I am surprised I didn't break a tooth.,0
This has to be the worst McDonalds! The food is never hot and never fresh.  I went there again tonight since it's the only place open.   The fries were warm and tasted like they had been cooked in an air frier and the burger was cold and tasted like it had been sitting for hours.   This places stays pretty busy so there is no excuse for poor quality of food imo.   Avoid unless it's your only option.,0
Food was bad. They barely put special sauce on Big Mac. I couldn't really taste the sauce at all.,0
Used to be a fun place to go to but everything has changed,0
I am really surprised that McDonald refused service for food at 4:00 am when we were starving and reached there for food. The lady at the dr,0
rubbish service,0
If you want to watch employee's fight and spend a half a hour waiting on fries and a Frappe this is the McDonalds for you. Service between 5 - 6 am horrible and the 10pm line is backed up onto Ewing Ave. Very Childish and unpleasant employee's.,0
It has been 20+ min and im still sitting here as I am writing this waiting for my food. And the employees seem too busy to acknowledge your presence half the time when you are trying to speak to them.,0
They disregard promotion offers and very arrogance stuff and unfriendly boss. Very bad commercial for mcdonalds brands.,0
"We go here after almost every late night event we attend in Salt Lake City. Concerts, Jazz games, Utes games. Will probably find another place. The Fries have been way below the McDonald's standard for the last few times and this last time, they changed their ice cream completely. Now the vanilla cones and the hot fudge sundaes are made with that cheap ""ice cream"" that is a cross between a terrible sorbet and cheap refrozen ice milk. Truly disgusting. At least the Cokes were $1.00...but that won't bring us back.",0
"Bad experience, bad grade, that's the game. The ordering machine does not issue a ticket to justify his order but especially his payment.",0
Waiting 45 min in the drive thru.... never again.. horrible,0
Pink slime. Yuck!,0
Ridiculous staff was lazy rude and slow bathroom was disgusting I did not eat there and I was hungry so I just left,0
I walked in to meet a friend that was eating and ended up with a boot on my car. Don't go here,0
I ordered a caramel machiatto and it tasted really spoiled. Last time I will be visiting here.,0
I have been in line for an hour to get 2 Quarter pounders meals. What ever happened to FAST FOOD? This is ridiculous. I have a starving child at home.,0
"The service used to be good, but nowadays it sucks! I always order by the app and they make me wait over 20 min, I got out of my car and with a no really happy face they gave me my order, the place was dirty and didn smell good at all, you ne",0
Horrible service. Dirty and delayed,0
Long wait in drive thru and wrong order,0
The worse mcdonalds in America and absolutely heart breaking the way they treat homeless people. All Hispanic crew so you would think being immigrants fighting Trump they would be more sympathetic,0
Check you food good because my wife had chewed into a frie that she thought was burnt but no she spot it out and we checked it out who knows what it was but it smelled really really bad and tasted nasty my wife said,0
it's too bad,0
When you go to McDonald's you are expecting fast and consistent food. Not the case here. My order came out 16 minutes after I ordered and the sandwich was on the wrong bread.,0
"My children find a dead mouse. I requested to speak with the supervisor.....made her aware of the situation.....She HAD THE NERVE TO TELL ME THAT SOMEONE (IMPLYING MAYBE ONE OF MY KIDS) MUST HAVE JUST PUT IT THERE.
***YES, we had already eaten the food.....if not.....I would have requested a FULL REFUND***",0
Sending everyone to overflow and then 20 minutes later delivered all reheated food that looks prepared over an hour ago. Whoever the order taker at 1pm is is the rudest woman ever. Terrible McDonald's,0
Not good,0
Dry hamburger buns,0
I can't remember the time I got good fries from them.   Once in a while there are good employees there that make up for it but I have simply dropped this place from my list of places to go after the last few times I've eaten there.  I should say this is for all McDonald's,0
"I needed a pick me up and stoped by for some iced coffee. Since I am diabetic , i can only have regular  cold coffee with milk , no flavored milk . Still i had to pay full price for a med cold coffee  (with only 3 ice cubes I wished for ) came out for almost 2 $ ! I think this is pretty unfair , overpriced and pure profit ! So I am not ever going to buy anything from Mc.Donald anymore .",0
It's called fast food for a reason and there is nothing fast about McDonald's in key west. The staff is rude and there hasn't been one time they have gotten my order correct.,0
"I found a hair in my fries, and when I brought it to the staff's attention, they were unapologetic and didn't offer any compensation.",0
I don't know where to start. OMG! This is the slowest MCDs restaurant in the world. Staff act like if they were on vacation. You can see in their faces that they hate working here and are just looking forward to the end of their shift. Manager came out after a while and there was no improvement in performance. The automated order system was not working so I waited in line for 10 mins. just to order and pay. From this point it was exactly 27 mins. until my order was ready. All that was was a bottle of water and a mocha coffee. And I had to ask them otherwise it would have been more than half hour. I reckon staff must really ask themselves whether they want to work here. There may be other better places where they could find job satisfaction. Here they're just turning a bunch of people into unhappy customers.,0
"It has been many years since I have gone into McDonald's, and this time was no different, I was there to drop off my Redbox rental.",0
"For workers like her big companies' name are ashamed.

What a horrific experience I just had;  this lady you see in the picture for telling her she was giving me a wrong item and not the one I paid for she started a big drama and spilt my son's smoothie and started singing a vulgar song/lyrics as per offending me through that and not directly addressed to me. All that in front of the manager ..

Besides that waiting time was ridiculous long with a lot of customers not satisfied and even a uber eats guy had to cancel in front of  me because they didn't make his order in more than 20 min that I was there ...

Another lady in the back was not using the yellow paper that sandwiches have she was placing the  buns/bread directly on the table as she was preparing food for dogs. She saw me and start acting like nothing happened..

This place is a completely mess

JUST STAY AWAY",0
My order was never corrected,0
I just paid $11.20 for a hard fish sandwich & cold fries!!! At least they didn scr,0
"The people who work here are absolutely ridiculous. Bunch of kids who obviously hate their jobs and no leadership. Employees are fighting with each other in here and the entire place is full of unhappy, hungry customers. Add the ubereats and doordash people and everything else and complete madhouse",0
"Based on experience with mc donalds in europe, this is rather sub-par. But it is ok, gets the job done in feeding you.",0
Worst ever had,0
Good ,1
McDonalds is my go to fast food restaurant. It has been the only place since my son was a baby that we have been able to go to get a quick bite to eat due to his severe dairy allergy. Yes they have a dairy free meal for him and for me a gluten free meal. A match you can't beat. I won't say how old my son is but McDonalds has been ahead of their time for over two decades now when it comes to having special meals. It's been a great place for our family to go.,1
Good drive thru. Has napkins accessible. Corporate branch.,1
Excellent food and super friendly staff.,1
Fast service and Standard McDonald's quality,1
"The fresh coffee is good! Only 99 cents, you can not beat that! A lot of freebies if you download the app! Paola,  the assistant manager,  is cute and friendly!",1

The manager at this store is absolutely outstanding . They just reintroduced the steak bagel and I said what can I change the bread to a McGriddle and she did that without a single question. I even went as far as to ask her if I have the round egg instead of the folded and she jumped right to it and that was fantastic. Try it sometime it's wonderful thank you very much and God bless.,1

Glad I walked in. The drive-thru line was ginormous. (TWO lines!) Ordering inside was pretty easy - a couple order kiosks or a plexi-barrier'ed pair of cash registers.

It's a little bit hard to get in and out of the parking lot other than that everybody is very nice and it's a good facility they don't run as many specials or deals like by two or buy one get one free on the breakfast sandwiches and stuff like a lot of other McDonald's do so that's why I didn't give him five stars other than that the place is clean and they're good,1
"I don't love it. It's an unfortunate weakness in my DNA that I can't be hungry. I was a hungry child and find myself eating fatty foods just to feel full longer. I know it's bad. It's only a convenience to go to McDonald's and it's cheap. I will try harder to be organic. It's what I dream of. Gold? No. I'm more of a silver lady. Arches? Again, No. Absolutely nothing memorable about MO. (Misery)",1

"Very average McDonald's experience overall. Was cool because of the whole ""largest McDonald's"" bit, but it was extremely hectic inside with kids running and screaming everywhere. Took a while to even get the opportunity to order, then food took a while to get to us, which is understandable since it was so busy. Ice was out in 3/4 soda machines. Not a very clean place either. Pizza was alright. Very dry, flavorless crust, pretty soggy and could have used more time in the oven/ the oven could be hotter. If they put like 20% more effort into the flavor of the pizza it would be a lot better. Onion ""slivers"" were also just onion chunks. Not a big deal, just a little misleading. But what else you expect from a McDonalds. Food is a little pricier than the McDonald's I'm used to as well. Would probably have a better experience making the effort to dine elsewhere.",1

Good fast location. They had a third window for you to pull forward to keep the line moving through the drive thru instead of having someone walk out to your car. It was super convenient and it did seem to save time. We will probably stop by this location again before our trip it over. You can't really go wrong with $1 cheeseburgers.,1

It can get tight getting inside when there's a delivery truck next to the store. Most especially when you're going towards the drive-thru 占쏙,1
Live nearby and this is our choice McDonald's compared to others in close distance. I gotta say though that the last order of fries I got really were so yucky I chewed on 2 and didnt eat the rest. They tasted over cooked or double cooked. Something made them rubbery and inedible to me.,1

"Got two Filet-O-Fish sandwiches.  Both were good as expected.  I ordered through the McDonald's app and opted to pickup my sandwiches at the drive thru.  I told the employee at the speaker that I had an app order to pickup and gave her the code.  She instructed me to go to the first window.  There I was given the receipt, thanked, and told to go to the next window.  At the 2nd window I was told to go to a 3rd window to pickup the order.  The 3rd window is kind of funny, since it seems like an afterthought.  Since it is at the corner of the building close to a sign, it is difficult to get close enough to be handed the order without scraping the side of your car. Then to leave you have to turn your wheels hard right.  The employees were very friendly.",1

Spanish latte - creamy but not milky latte with a hint of cinnamon that isn't overpowering!

Lavender matcha latte - strong matcha flavor that compliments the lavender. It's not milky at all! I really like floral matcha",1

"This location is huge for a McDonald's. It has play area and arcade games. It also offers customize pizza and pasta menu, in addition to the usual offering. Prices are slightly more compared to other locations, which is justifiable given the amenities it offers. I saw some reviews complained about slow or bad service. I didn't notice that on my visit.  Overall, I think it worths a visit if u happen to be in the area.",1
This is a very nice and clean McDonald's with very fast service and now you can fill your own soda which is a bonus. Thanks Ronald. 占쏙,1

"I Honestly can not believe that I am going to give the McDonald's in Brodheadsville five/5 STARS!!!!
They deserve it they have proven it to us over and over again..  The New Manager (wish I knew her name) has taken this location from a zero/0 stars to getting a rating of Five/5 Stars and I know that it could not have been easy. I have picked up dinner her once a week for 8-9 weeks in a row and the FOOD has been great.  Thats a lot considering its a McDonald's. My food when I picked it up was always hot, all the food was there correctly. Everything was well made and put together.  You can tell the new manager has set the standards extremely high at this location and the employees have responded extremely well for her. She deserves a big hand for caring about her staff and customers.
Thank You for Caring.......
Great job!!   Well done!!!!!",1

Normally I would give this restaurant five stars but today service was really slow. I placed an order for two Egg McMuffins & a large french vanilla coffee. My wait time was approximately 10 minutes. I also believe on this particular day the restaurant was understaffed. Again usually this restaurant is a five-star McDonald's just not on this day.,1
Food was good.  Check your fries prior to leaving.  Mine were cold.,1
I enjoy coming to eat to this McDonalds. But the cashiers are very slow. And many of them have bad attitudes,1

"The only reason I am giving this location for stars instead of 5 is because overall, I don't eat McDonald's or fast food. However, the one day that I did go to Santa Monica, I just had a sudden craving for something fatty and sugary.

I went inside and dislocation surprisingly very clean. The staff there were also very hospitable, friendly, and alert. I ordered me some french fries and a sweet iced tea, and then I proceeded to the outdoor Courtyard to eat.

Out there was just as clean as it was on the inside. I haven't had McDonald's since 2012, so I was really surprised at how fresh the french fries and the sweet iced tea taste it.

Everything was okay okay with me.",1

It has partially worked on a couple of occasions and my granddaughter remembers that she enjoyed it. Every time we퐎e there she stomps on it to try to make it work.

"They literally almost got the entire order wrong, would not come back ever. My family got two deluxe s round egg, 1small decaf coffee, 2 med coffees with sugar and cream. We ended up with packets of ketchup, no bread for the muffins in the deluxes,no hashbrowns and the wrong amount of cream.

Ok sorry I actually came back the other day and the food was amazing this time. Also, there is another McDonald's in my area that's pretty lame. This place has a better service overall.(sort of long review sorry)",1
"The most recent time was great! Fries were hot n crispy. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I'm still thinking about the Time before last, the fries were cold right out the gate.",1

Love McDonald占쏙,1
"Ordered two plain fish sandwiches with no cheese or  tartar sauce, due to a dairy allergy. When I got to the pick up window - they had put slices of cheese in both sandwiches. I returned them and had to sit and wait for the order to be corrected.  Unfortunately, this happens constantly, no matter what McDonald's I go too. It's clear the prep team simply isn't paying attention to the instructions on the orders.",1
Big place... Busy. Good for big groups.,1

It is a good restaurant and by downloading the restaurant application you get good space.,1
I like coming to this location the morning team is always kind & friendly...the night team has more younger team members some of them have great customer service..but the only thing that stopped me from rating 5 stars the point system I've had trouble several times adding my code to gain point for my purchase ...and reached out to McDonald's customer service and was told someone would contact me but that hasn't happened ,1

I even ate pizza here and the management didn't seem to care and it's a good place to eat and work. There aren't too many good McDonald's you can find a good plug in for your laptop but this one is awesome.

The staff is good and very helpful every time I go there. One day I was low on money but really had to eat. One of the guys who worked there gave me a break and upsized my drink as a courtesy. It was hot as $h&t outside and I had a longer lasting drink to curve the heat.",1
The Big-Mac is better than ever.  And the Junior Mac is great. You gotta love it.  Food is consistent at the 90th South location.,1
LOL this Macky Ds is a fun one to go when you want to hit up Chinatown and all its glory!  I think I ate there only once and it was like any other Mc Ds but alot more people and alot more drama...a sight to be seen!,1

New design for Mcdonalds very clean and friendly.,1
"World largest McDonald's. Food is the same, they have pizza and pasta too. The seating and ordering process was quick and easy, but actually getting the food on time together was a challenge.

Our burgers came in fairly fast 10 minutes or so, but pizza took 30 minutes+ from the time when we ordered it. I had to come down and ask for my order for them to give me the pizza.

Honestly, this worth a single visit, especially the playground if you have kids. If you looking for a quick bite, I would go to the other locations with less people and quicker service.",1

"There are two lanes of drive through. I ordered on the mobile app while waiting in line.  When I got to the speaker,  they didn't bother to ask my order,  or order number.  They just kept taking people from the other line. I know that sometimes happens,  they forget the order cars pull up. But not 4 in a row. As they started taking the 5th car,  I pulled into the line and went to the window.  Food was OK when I got it.  But waiting 30 minutes for that to happen in the drive through isn't cool.",1

Best fries I have had in a while. Also got a cheeseburger and I must admit I was also pleased as I hate it when I decide to actually eat 1,000 calories and my cheese is thrown in my hamburger and not even melted yucky. But all was right on this last time. Good cheez burg& 占쏙",1

Today we were there around 7pm and the cashier and the manager were so nice to us and they even talked to my kids and made sure that we got everything we asked for. The only thing I didn't like was that for the happy meals for my kids they got the same toy and it was a girl toy, I have a girl and a boy so my son got a girl toy. I know why McDonald's do this but it's not the employees fault.",1

The food was typical McDs, but every staff member was just so friendly and helpful.  Granted I dont eat at inside McDs often, but I have never been so delighted and cared for ar one.  Greeted as I walked in, ordered from kiosks, food delivered to me, staff member checked on how my food was and wished well by members as I left.  McDs needs to bottle up the service from this location and send to all.  Cheers.",1

Best mcdonalds in the area but for some reason they charge a few cents more. Not a big deal but just something I noticed. The staff makes fries fresh forreal lol upon request. Nuggs are Hit or miss. But burgers are pretty good. Not a fan of the chicken products from here but the other mcodnalds on 86th and 20 has good chicken,1

"Long lines but that's McDonald's for you, when they are selling crack I mean two all beef patties with special sauce on a sesame seed bun. The problems lies when you have a big order at the drive through. You must hold the line to make sure you got everything you ordered because you dont want to have to go inside or go through the drive through again. Quite a dilemma.",1

"Updated review 2022: This really is a great McDonald's. Maybe if you don't appreciate it, you haven't been around. The grounds are clean, I saw the manager (Chris) picking up trash around the store. They wear nice uniforms and there was an employee cleaning tables as soon as they were vacant. A very nice lady on morning shift was bringing orders TO THE TABLE ya'll. It was much busier at night so a longer wait but considering there are dozens of hotels nearby, I think service is pretty fast. (2019 Review) I went here three times during my stay in the area and the food was always hot, place clean and staff prompt and courteous. Got a fabulous greeting Memorial Day morning.",1
"Had a pleasant trip here with my 5 year old. On vacation from Indiana and compared to any McDonald's there this is like a fine dining restaurant lol clean, food was fresh, tomatoes where not mushy which brings me to believe they actually don't freeze there's like back at home. Had two managers walking around the restaurant actually working instead of being in the backroom 'doing paperwork' five stars definitely will be returning before we go back home.",1

It's a fairly new McDonalds. I like the comfortable padded chairs for the 2 person tables if you eat in. Of course all the great hot food and serve yourself & free refills of drink. A great choice for a quick lunch!,1

"Awesome McDonalds with a huge dining and play area along with a full arcade. They offer both make your own pizza and pasta which is a unique and fun experience to create via the kiosks. All the food was good and was delivered directly to our table. The staff was pleasant and helpful. Definitely check out the USA's largest McDonalds if you can, you won't regret it!",1
"EDIT: Recently this McDonald's had been improving a lot, especial when compared to other McDonald's in the area (maybe the one on North part of W. Parmer, but not really fair comparison, I mean That one has a god-damn waterfall....). Keep up the good work! +1 Star

OLD: They took out all the power outlets and a table was just left broken covered with caution tape. Always understaffed and you can tell the owners are sucking this place for every penny without putting anything back in. Gives family owned McDonald's a bad name.",1
"Had to wait for RESTROOMS. When I got in the men's room was clean, well stocked with soap and TP. The rest of the restaurant was clean and the staff was good to me.",1
"Excellent and fresh, hot, food.  The inside is spacious and clean. Friendly staff but I don't like the system where you have to order by yourself with the large touch pad, makes it hard to customize your order and confusing.  I'd rather just wait in line and have the attendants take my order like most McDonald's.  But at this McDonald's you must order at the touch pad by yourself.",1
Loved everything from the service to the food. Between the promotions and coupons I save money. The loyalty points build up then I can get a free item. Today O had a large mocha frappe. Yum,1

I like McDonald's McChicken sandwiches and their Sundaes its delicious! I also like the way how they packaged their food Delivery its sealed with a security tape both drinks and food inside a secured paper bag with handles !! Best Fast food well safely secured in these challenging times when Coronavirus is ravaging our population and its health !! All fast food chains should follow McDonald's safety packaging procedures for food packaging deliveries !!,1
This place is really nice. I loved the decoration.,1
I really like burgers,1

This is a pretty automated McDonald. Probably one of the most automated ones I퐒e come across. Many of the customers went strait to the devices shown to enter their order and just stood near the pick up counter for their order. I felt the process was still a bit slow given that the emphasis is for automation though. Plus the area to stand was congested since it,1

No heavy traffic which means your food is made fresh and rarely sitting for too long. Would recommend over McDonald's entertainment location further up international drive where the prices are significantly higher.,1

"From a quick visit about 4 months ago:

Dining room was small, seemed clean (my order was to-go so didn't spend much time inside).

Loved the digital menu/self-order kiosks (ordered at the kiosk and it still gave the option to pay cash at the register, though not sure if that option's still available and/or if the dining room's even open right now...?).

Staff was friendly enough and very helpful, packed my to-go order like absolute pros.

The area where the fountain drinks, straws, etc., are wasn't super tidy (a bit of a spill on the countertop, if memory serves); however, seemed clean, otherwise.

Because it was such a quick trip, didn't get to see the condition of the bathrooms (a good indicator of an establishment's working and overall conditions, in my experience). Maybe another time?

Overall, a good experience.

Something to consider: there's no drive-through nor a parking lot and finding a parking space seems to be a nightmare/hit-or-miss in that area. Circled the surrounding blocks a few times before someone parked almost right in front of the store just happened to be leaving (not sure how often that happens, though). Score!

The previous parking spot I'd found was about 2 blocks away (doable), but kept searching in order to be closer to the other establishment my group and I were visiting prior to McD's.",1

Just when the cashier told us of the kindness, the tow guy called... he was one hour early! I didn't even see what type of car the kind people drove or get to wave thanks.
